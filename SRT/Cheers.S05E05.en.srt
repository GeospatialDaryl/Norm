1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,954
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:06,456
Yeah, it says here

3
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:08,458
there's another sighting
of the Loch Ness monster.

4
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:09,959
Yeah? Do you believe that?

5
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:11,461
There's even a picture of him.

6
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,463
Whoa! Looks kind of
like President Reagan.

7
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:14,414
That is Reagan.

8
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,416
The other picture's the monster.

9
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,417
Oh, I see.

10
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,921
Wonder if they'll ever
catch that thing, huh?

11
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,923
Well, I, for one, hope they never do.

12
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,925
I mean, none of us really want to see

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,428
that poor beast hauled out of the water

14
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,430
and put on display in some sideshow.

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,431
Well, I sure would.

16
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,433
You know, we could all go together.

17
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,434
I don't mind driving.

18
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,436
Yeah, but, uh, you see, Woody, they...

19
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,437
You know, it'd be kind of fun.

20
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,438
We could pack a lunch.

21
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,906
No, Woody, they...

22
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,907
All right, who wants
peanut butter and jelly

23
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,158
and who wants bologna?

24
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:43,493
Woody, they...

25
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,495
I'll have one of each, all right?

26
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:51,284

Hey, Carla, how's that
house-hunting going, huh?

42
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,844
Does that answer your question?

43
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,597
Yes, very nicely.

44
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,882
Boy, I'll tell you, it's hopeless.

45
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,884
I've looked everywhere
in the Boston area,

46
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,770
and I just cannot find a
house in my price range.

47
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,056
After scrimping and saving for years,

48
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,060
I think I got finally enough
set aside for a little place,

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,062
and find out I ain't got squat.

50
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,814
Well, what's the big rush?
Your apartment's fine.

51
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,649
No, it's not.

52
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,152
My kids get bigger, my
apartment gets smaller.

53
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
I don't know what it's like

54
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,039
to be alone in a bathroom anymore.

55
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,907
What's it like, Sam?

56
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,077
Is it everything people say it is?

57
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,580
More. Much, much more.

58
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,082
I knew it.

59
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,084
Hello, everyone.

60
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,085
Hi.

61
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,086
DIANE: Sam, I happen

62
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,588
to be free tonight.

63
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,590
If a certain gentleman should

64
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,091
come to knock on my door,

65
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,060
say, about 7:30,

66
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,562
I wouldn't be adverse to going out.

67
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,064
I sure hope you get lucky.

68
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:03,850
Because I did; I got myself

69
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,735
a hot date tonight.

70
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:08,605
I see what you're doing.

71
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,524
Even though I eventually
agreed to marry you,

72
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,028
you're still smarting from the
sting of my initial rejection

73
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,030
and looking for ways to punish me.

74
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,533
No, I'm not going out with
other women to punish you.

75
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,035
That's just one of the perks.

76
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,540
If you're trying to make
me jealous, you can stop.

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,542
I want you to date these women.

78
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,929
While they may look
better in leotards--

79
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,431
then again,
they may not--

80
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,934
they can't compare to the total package

81
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,435
you've experienced with me.

82
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,804
Oh, I see-- we're
talking brains.

83
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,056
Listen, I'll have you know

84
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,059
that Tiffany happens to be a
very exceptional young woman.

85
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,446
Ah, yes, Tiffany-- the
girl with the IQ of a lamp.

86
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,816
Let me describe her for you:

87
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,818
spandex wardrobe.

88
00:03:55,818 --> 00:04:00,073
Spends all of her time in a gym.

89
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,911
Breasts that would provide
shade for a small boy.

90
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,333
You, you're not even close.

91
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,085
You, you're so far from being close.

92
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,586
She makes me crazy.

93
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,470
Did you hear that?

94
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,805
Yup.

95
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,307
Hi, can I speak to Tiffany, please?

96
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,642
I don't know; try the aerobics class.

97
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:22,312
Yeah, yeah, will you just tell her

98
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,597
that... Sam can't make it tonight.

99
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,483
Uh, something's upset his stomach.

100
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,986
Yeah, thank you.

101
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:30,770
Whew. Boy.

102
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,775
Got to be somebody in here with a brain.

103
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,279
I mean, I don't even care
if she's good-looking.

104
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,165
You got a sister, Frasier?

105
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,866
No.

106
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,368
You have a dress?

107
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,171
What's the occasion?

108
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,962
Hey, tutti-frutti and a rooti.

109
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,464
Oh, boy, a good and gracious afternoon

110
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,466
to every one of you wonderful people.

111
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,968
Oh, Cliffie, cheer up, bud.

112
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,970
Eh, Normie, I'm a happy man.

113
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,222
I started a new route today.

114
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,056
So, where is it?

115
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,057
Uh, Meadowview Acres.

116
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,059
You know, just north of the airport?

117
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,060
It's a real plum.

118
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,562
Yeah, best route in the city.

119
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,563
No one else wanted it, huh?

120
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,064
(chuckling)

121
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,816
Are you kidding?

122
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,651
It's a nesting ground for
stewardesses out there.

123
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,653
Yeah, there's a house
full of them, you know,

124
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,654
living all together.

125
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,156
And they're nuts about me.

126
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,657
Well, how do you know that, Mr. Clavin?

127
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,159
Woody, they stand behind the curtain,

128
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,660
laughing and giggling the way women do

129
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,162
when they're taken with a man.

130
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,665
Have a couple of drafts, Woody?

131
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,666
Oh, hey, Carla, listen,

132
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,169
if you're still, uh,
searching out a new house,

133
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,171
uh, I got a doozy out there on my route.

134
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,173
I wrote out the, uh, particulars.

135
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,057
Give me this.

136
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,009
"Meadowview Acres."

137
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,511
I know where that is.

138
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,013
I couldn't afford...

139
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,016
Hey, this thing is in my price range...

140
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,519
which means it is either
built on quicksand,

141
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,405
or is currently on fire.

142
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,690
CLIFF: Look, Carla, I looked at it

143
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,192
and it looked all right to me.

144
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
Come on, Carla, check it out.

145
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,694
What do you got to lose?

146
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,945
You really think I should?

147
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,782
Yeah, remember what your
horoscope said today?

148
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,785
"Take a chance, explore other avenues."

149
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,670
That's right!

150
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,504
And you know what?

151
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,006
That jives with my other two horoscopes,

152
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,009
my tarot cards, and Madame
Livinda's latest palm reading.

153
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,511
SAM: Well, there you go.

154
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,513
I think I better go give
this thing a look-see.

155
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,014
I'll be back later. Yeah, bye-bye.

156
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,015
CARLA: Okay.

157
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,884
Hey, Mr. Peterson, I'm a Leo.

158
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,135
What's my horoscope say?

159
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,438
Young bartender should refill mug

160
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:31,941
of thirsty patron at corner of bar.

161
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,944
Those things are so vague,
they could apply to anyone.

162
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,237
Sammy! Sammy!

163
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,122
Listen, I went to see that house,

164
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,039
and it was perfect.

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,541
I mean, listen to this.

166
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,544
Me and the older kids
could have rooms of our own.

167
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,045
Oh-ho!

168
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,547
And there's this big kitchen

169
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,550
with Formica as far
as the eye could see.

170
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,336
And there's grass, Sammy.

171
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,340
I mean, can you imagine
having grass of your very own

172
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,728
to water and mow and lie down
in naked anytime you want.

173
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,563
That's the American dream, all right.

174
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,482
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh--
there's a fireplace.

175
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,484
Finally the kids are
going to have a place

176
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,486
where they're supposed to start a fire.

177
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:19,989
I'm so excited, I don't know what to do.

178
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:20,990
Carla, you're talking

179
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,492
like you've already bought the place.

180
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:23,359
I did.

181
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,744
You what? I bought it!

182
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,162
I did!

183
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,664
(everyone exclaiming)

184
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:29,665
They took my first offer.

185
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,167
Went through without a hitch.

186
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,668
Your very first offer?

187
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:35,171
Yeah, yeah, they could see
I'd be a tough negotiator

188
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,172
and buckled under.

189
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:37,423
Well, when do you move in?

190
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,257
In a few weeks.

191
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,259
I got to wait for the loan to clear,

192
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,678
but the guy at the
bank said not to worry,

193
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:43,679
so I'm not going to.

194
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,681
Life is too wonderful to worry.

195
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,183
Thank you.

196
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,184
SAM: Carla, Carla,

197
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:49,635
don't you think there's somebody else

198
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,554
you ought to say something to?

199
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,556
Oh.

200
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,313
Cliff.

201
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,114
Stop. Don't move.

202
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,616
Don't turn around.

203
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,617
Don't say anything.

204
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,118
Just look at the floor.

205
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,119
Huh?

206
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,121
Just do as I said.

207
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,077
Cliff, I want to thank you
for telling me about the house.

208
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,579
You're welcome.

209
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,081
Oh, puke. I knew you'd get mushy.

210
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:31,477
I see the search for intelligent
forms of life continues.

211
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,478
Do you mind?

212
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,980
You're in my light.

213
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,982
I am your light.

214
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,485
Happy hunting.

215
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,486
Uh-huh.

216
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,488
Evening, everybody.

217
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,990
EVERYONE: Norm!

218
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,441
What's shakin', Mr. Peterson?

219
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,443
What isn't?

220
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,448
Hey, there, Norm.

221
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,451
Carla bought that
house I told her about.

222
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,703
And she knew its history?

223
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,038
What, what do you mean?

224
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
Well, the asking price

225
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
just seemed a little low for that area,

226
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
so I did a little checking on my own.

227
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044
Oh, no. I don't think
I want to hear this.

228
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,429
Yeah, apparently,

229
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,797
the house is built

230
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,683
directly over the graveyard
of a 17th-century prison.

231
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,936
Oh, my God!

232
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:16,439
It wasn't exactly a
white-collar prison, either.

233
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,941
The worst murderers and
cutthroats of their time.

234
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,810
They executed hundreds of them.

235
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,194
(groans)

236
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,114
Local legend has it that they're
going to rise from the grave

237
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:27,617
and seek revenge on
whoever dares to live there.

238
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,368
(groaning)

239
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,537
NORM: Well, we all know

240
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,373
how superstitious Carla is.

241
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,376
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God,

242
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,379
oh, God! What's with him?

243
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,249
He, uh, forgot his dry cleaning.

244
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,587
Let me have a scotch
and an Irish coffee.

245
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,058
I guess she doesn't know about it, huh?

246
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,559
Of course she doesn't know.

247
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,562
Would you buy a house that
had that kind of history?

248
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,431
Houses have karmas.

249
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,683
SAM: Look at her; she's so happy.

250
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,352
But she has a right to know.

251
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,654
Well, I don't know.

252
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:07,156
It's always dangerous
to mess with Carla,

253
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,158
but especially when she's happy.

254
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,660
It's like when, uh, Frankenstein

255
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,662
was playing with the
little girl, you know?

256
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,664
It was a bad time to go
up to him with a torch.

257
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,415
CLIFF: Yes, it's

258
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,584
a terrible time; a
terrible, terrible time.

259
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,869
I don't know; I think Diane's right.

260
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,870
I think we should tell her.

261
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,121
Maybe it's not too late

262
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,340
to do something about it.

263
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,791
Hey, Carla?

264
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,792
Yeah, Sam?

265
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,795
I got something to tell
you about the house.

266
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,798
Something not great.

267
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,468
I knew it.

268
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,304
Carla Tortelli, when
will you ever learn?

269
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,806
After all these years of heartbreak,

270
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,558
you still get your hopes up.

271
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,360
Okay, get it over with.

272
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,612
What's wrong with it?

273
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,447
Diane?

274
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:57,323
Carla, your house is built over
a 17th-century prison graveyard.

275
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,627
That's it?

276
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,046
Mm-hmm.

277
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,498
Thank God!

278
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,383
I thought you were
gonna say it had dry rot.

279
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,217
Dry...?

280
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,586
Oh, no problem.

281
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,423
So, how's the new homeowner, huh?

282
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,808
Fine. Just great.

283
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:33,809
Well, are you still living

284
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,811
out of those cardboard boxes?

285
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,813
Yeah, you know how it is.

286
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:39,815
DIANE: You know, Carla,

287
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:42,318
I really admire you.

288
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,321
It took such courage to overlook

289
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,823
the unhallowed ground on
which your house is built.

290
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:51,243
I know I would've had my
last earthly moment of rest

291
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,746
in that house the moment I moved in.

292
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,499
Why, I could no more close my eyes

293
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:00,503
in that cauldron of blood
than sever my own arm.

294
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,004
SAM: Hey, Diane...

295
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,591
Oh, yes, well...

296
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,593
Angels on your pillow.

297
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,214
You know, I get this feeling in my gut

298
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,216
that something's bothering Carla.

299
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,102
I'm going to find out what it is.

300
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,888
Hey, uh, so, Carla, how's the house?

301
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,640
It's a great house!
It's a wonderful house!

302
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,442
It's the best house in the world!

303
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,443
(angrily): Ooh!

304
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,231
What's the matter?

305
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,734
Nothing.

306
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,736
Did you find a problem
after you moved in?

307
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:39,992
No... 'cause I haven't
actually moved in yet.

308
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,796
So... you are bothered
by the house's history?

309
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,798
Of course I'm bothered by it.

310
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,800
I saw Poltergeist.

311
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,802
Do you think I want to end up in the TV?

312
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,307
I just didn't say anything before

313
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,177
'cause I didn't want
anyone to know I was scared.

314
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,147
Sammy, there's something
evil in that house,

315
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:05,151
something cold and clammy and horrible.

316
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,652
It doesn't want me there.

317
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,072
Carla, I've had phobias before,

318
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,575
and I've found that
the first essential step

319
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,077
in overcoming one is to confront it.

320
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:17,580
I'll bet if you spent one night,

321
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,582
God help you, in that house...

322
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,085
...your fears would be licked.

323
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,086
Hey.

324
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,087
You're not going to let anything

325
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,089
stand in the way of
your dreams, are you?

326
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,510
No, I'm not.

327
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,512
I've never been a quitter.

328
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,881
I'm going to spend
tonight in that house.

329
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,299
Good for you, Carla.

330
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,300
Damn right!

331
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,302
I'm going to conquer this thing.

332
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,304
I'm not going to let any demons

333
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,691
from the other world deny me my house.

334
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,028
Last chance to stop me.

335
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,240
(dog growling faintly)

336
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,796
(keys rattling)

337
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,134
(lock clicks)

338
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,602
(door creaking)

339
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,663
(switch clicks twice)

340
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,501
(clicking repeatedly)

341
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,185
(sighs)

342
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:06,105
Only ten more hours to go.

343
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,107
(doorbell rings)

344
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,609
(gasps, shrieks)

345
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:31,246
What are you two
ding-a-lings doing here?

346
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:34,300
Well, uh, we, uh, come
to spend the night.

347
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,804
And, uh...

348
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,807
I brought you a little
pizza with anchovies.

349
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,309
I hate anchovies.

350
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,810
Yeah, me, too.

351
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,812
Then let's eat, huh?

352
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,316
Hey, you know, this is a, uh,

353
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,817
nice place, Carla.

354
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,686
NORM: Yeah. Oh, yeah, hey, look.

355
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,521
Great fireplace here, Normie. Yeah.

356
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,022
Super living room.

357
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,423
Hey, you know, with a, uh,

358
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,526
little fresh paint and
some new wallpaper...

359
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,528
you'll have some, uh...

360
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,030
fresh paint and new wallpaper.

361
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,034
Look, I appreciate what
you guys are trying to do,

362
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,035
but it's not necessary.

363
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,420
I'm fine.

364
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,672
Oh, sure, you're fine. It's
a terrific place, Carla.

365
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,174
It's got a really nice feeling in here.

366
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,176
It's, uh, warm and cozy.

367
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,678
Have you checked out the
rest of the place yet?

368
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,180
No, I thought it might be

369
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,182
a good idea to have a beer first.

370
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,184
Yeah, I find that pretty much applies

371
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,686
to just about everything.

372
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,189
(dogs howling outside)

373
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,607
What was that?

374
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,558
Hound from hell.

375
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,860
No, no, no, no.

376
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,862
That's, a... that was a Dalmatian.

377
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,865
I'd say probably six, seven years old.

378
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,734
Definitely neutered.

379
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,153
Yep... I've, uh, never been bitten

380
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,155
by that breed, but, uh...

381
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,156
(phone rings)

382
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:48,657
What was that?

383
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,076
It was the telephone.

384
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,080
Keep an eye on Indiana Jones here, huh?

385
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,585
I do not have a good feeling
about this place, Cliff.

386
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,086
All right, Normie, look,

387
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,588
I said we're going to stick it out,

388
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,590
and that's exactly what
we're going to do, eh?

389
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,592
All right, if the going gets tough,

390
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,093
you can count on Norm Peterson.

391
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,596
Well, that was Sam.

392
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,098
Vera called. She wants you to come home.

393
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:13,982
Yep. I'm out of here.

394
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,353
Norm, Norm, come on!

395
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:19,354
I mean, since when are you

396
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,857
in such a rush to get home to Vera?

397
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:24,359
Since you moved in
over a graveyard, Carla.

398
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,360
Guys, look, I-I'm sorry.

399
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,362
I just... I don't know.

400
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:31,867
Scary stuff... just scares me.

401
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,091
Hey, hey, Normie, you're driving!

402
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,975
(sighs)

403
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:01,029
Well, guess it's, uh...
just the two of us, huh?

404
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,531
Yep.

405
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,983
("A Summer Place" playing) You
can take off, too, you know.

406
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,368
There's nothing keeping you here.

407
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,153
Yeah, no, I know.

408
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:15,077
Oh... I love that song.

409
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,084
Gee, I went to a lot of
dances in high school.

410
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,919
You were a dancer?

411
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,338
No, no, I was on the,
uh, decorating committee.

412
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,725
I still have crepe paper
stains on my fingers.

413
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,762
Yeah, I remember, you know,
watching all those kids

414
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,264
out there having one hell of a time,

415
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:38,267
and I thought, "Boy, I'd love
to be out there with them,"

416
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,769
but I could never find a
partner to practice with.

417
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,521
Fascinating.

418
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,028
Hey, hey, hey, keep your grubby fingers

419
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,532
off my piece there.

420
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,535
Hey, Carla, you know something?

421
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,455
This is the, uh, first time
we've ever been alone together.

422
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:01,957
Please, I'm eating.

423
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,346
Can I ask you a question?

424
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,847
Who's stopping you?

425
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,350
How come you're always getting on me?

426
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,770
Is it my fault you're such a yutz?

427
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,689
And as long as we're asking questions,

428
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,191
what are you doing here tonight?

429
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,644
Well, having a little
beer and a little pizza,

430
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:26,148
and, uh... helping a friend
through a scary night.

431
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,984
You think I'm scared?

432
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,320
I'm not scared.

433
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,822
No, Carla... it's
nothing to be ashamed of.

434
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,824
Remember what, uh,
Ernest Hemingway said...

435
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,209
Would you shut up?

436
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,628
No, I think that was Jack London.

437
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,051
Look, Carla,

438
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,554
I feel a little responsible
for getting you into this,

439
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,838
and I just thought you needed,

440
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,840
uh, somebody to be here with you.

441
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,843
I don't need anybody, least of all you.

442
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:56,728
All right.

443
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,097
Fine.

444
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,601
(door creaks open)

445
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,102
Cliff?

446
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,525
("Blue on Blue" playing)

447
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,829
You know, uh...

448
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:17,783
I taught a couple of
guys to dance in my day.

449
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,703
So?

450
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,123
So nothing.

451
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,547
First rule:

452
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:35,550
no stepping on the teacher's feet.

453
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,552
(chuckles)

454
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:38,553
Well,

455
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:40,055
yes, ma'am.

456
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,557
Give me your hands.

457
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,981
Loosen up, would ya?

458
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,232
I don't bite.

459
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,035
Well, not you.

460
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,037
All right,

461
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,956
rock, walk.

462
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,460
Rock... don't bounce.

463
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,963
BOTH: Rock, walk, rock, walk...

464
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,332
CARLA: There you go.

465
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,233
Hey! Hey!

466
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,352
What was your leg doing
underneath my head?

467
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,771
I don't know.

468
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,023
Hey, I was asleep.

469
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,576
I, I, I didn't even enjoy it.

470
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,779
You better not have.

471
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:44,119
What, uh, what time is it?

472
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,620
It's 4:30 in the morning.

473
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,621
Whoo...

474
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:50,625
It's gonna be dawn soon.

475
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:53,628
Hey!

476
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,013
I did it!

477
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,882
I stayed here all night!

478
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,383
The spell is broken.

479
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,385
Thank you, Cliff. Thank you. Thank you.

480
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:07,109
Oh, I wonder how long she's
been wanting to do that.

481
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,533
It's gonna be okay.

482
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,737
My luck is finally changing.

483
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,821
Hey, can you feel it?

484
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,740
Uh, feel what?

485
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,493
The house, it's different now.

486
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:27,746
It likes me. It wants me.

487
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,131
You know what?

488
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:31,633
I think I'm gonna put
the couch right over here.

489
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,635
And the oil painting of me and Elvis

490
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:35,637
on that wall.

491
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:36,638
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.

492
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,639
And the easy chair...

493
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,641
(rumbling)

494
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,644
What's that?

495
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:43,645
I don't know.

496
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,648
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

497
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,150
They're coming to get us.

498
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,019
They're gonna drag us back
down to the grave with them!

499
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:57,492
(gasps)

500
00:22:57,492 --> 00:23:00,779
(screaming)

501
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,114
(jet engines roaring)

502
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:02,998
(screaming)

503
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:07,502
No, wait, no, Carla,

504
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:08,503
know what that is?

505
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:13,008
It... it's-it's not the
dead coming out of the grave

506
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,010
to feast on human flesh.

507
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,013
It's an L-1011
wide-body.

508
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:23,518
You know, the sounds are very similar.

509
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:25,520
Yeah.

510
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,522
And I understand that
during foggy weather,

511
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,474
they have to reroute those babies

512
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,475
to runway two-niner.

513
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,477
It must be near here.

514
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,450
Do you mean

515
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,704
that this house, my house,

516
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:44,706
is at the end of a runway?

517
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:48,076
(whimpering): Uh-huh.

518
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,962
And that was a wide-body jet

519
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,465
landing ten feet from my backyard?

520
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,966
(whimpers): Yeah.

521
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,887
And this house is not
cheap because it's haunted,

522
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:02,307
but because it is right
next to the airport?

523
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,308
Yeah.

524
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:07,179
I'm home! Yay!
