         Good evening, everyone!

            You know, it's

                  What you mean 
                  to say is that

47
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,588
      I am the most beautiful   
      woman in any room I enter.

Yes. Well, thank you

59
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:46,531
        Hello, Rebecca.         

60
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:48,433
                  I have a small
                  favor to ask  

61
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,835
              regarding our     
              impending wedding.

62
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,204
      Since all my close friends
      will be out of town,      

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,307
          and we have had a     
          previous conversation,

64
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,809
        and our eyes have met on
        a number of occasions,  

65
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:01,646
            I was wondering if  
            you'd consent to    
            be my maid of honor.

66
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,249
        Me?                     

67
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,284
Isn't that usually              
your best friend?               

68
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,585
                    You are my  
                    best friend.

Oh, I'm very flattered.         

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,406
Um... I guess so.               

71
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,574
Sure, Lila.                     

72

73
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,510
Right. Right.                   

74
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:17,895
I knew that.                    

75
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:19,130
                  Let's discuss

        Do you think black...   

77
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,749
Sam, it, uh,                    
goes without saying             

78
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,119
of course, that you'll be       
my best man.                    

79
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:25,703
 Aw, I-I don't want to do that. 

80
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,672
    It makes me feel            
    so uncomfortable.           

81
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,775
     I mean, a best man has     
  to give a toast, doesn't he?  

82
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,510
 No, look, I-I took the liberty 

83
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,546
 of writing down a few things.  

84
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,030
            Then I'd be honored.

85
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:37,665

    I haven't any plans.

      to have one tonight?

91

            a bachelor party?   

92

that particular ritual          

93
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,265
is as passé as taking           
the topknot of one's dead enemy,

94
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,701
I will not deprive you          
of the experience.              

95

101
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:09,164
You know, uh,                   
being maid of honor             

102
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,766
means you have                  
to throw Brunehilda             

103
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,168

105
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,504
                I guess I should
                do something.   

106
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:17,355
             What kind of shower
             do you think?      

107

hitching up with.               

109
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,844
Better make it marital aids.    

110
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:25,446
    I'll handle this.           

111
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,514
          Uh, Lilith?           

112

     That would be lovely.      

115
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,403
     Now, you're gonna have     
to tell me who to invite,       

116
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,504
    because I don't know...

      anything about you.

  I could repay you, Rebecca.   

120
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,129
     Oh, don't mention it.      

121
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,147

    to admit a family member

    to a mental institution,    

123
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,884
    I could certainly           
    speed up the paperwork.     

124

                  Yep.

let me make you an offer.       

156
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,008
If, after your madcap night     
of debauchery and vomiting,     

157
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:04,311

through with the wedding plans,

160
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,416

cold and analytical.

having a good time,             

375
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't have to call home       
to see if I can stay later.     

376
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:48,485
Oh, that reminds me.            

377
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,886
SAM:                            
There, right there.             

378
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:51,221
There you go.                   

379
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,990
See, that's                     
what you're losing, man--       

380
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,491
your freedom.                   

381
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:57,828
You know, I can eat doughnuts   
for dinner if I want to.        

382
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,530
Nobody nags me                  
to put down the toilet seat.    

383
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,967
I am the king                   
of my own remote control.       

384
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,268
I can date                      
anybody I want to,              

385
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,003
and if somebody better          
turns up--                      

386
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,405
and somebody always does,       
bless their hearts--            

387
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,307
then I can date them            
the very next night.            

388
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,508
You know,                       
I don't have to worry           

389
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,876
about forgetting                
an anniversary,                 

390
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,113
no mother-in-laws,              
no father-in-laws,              

391
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:18,248
no laws, period.                

392
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,984
                 I only asked   
                 for one reason.

393
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,253
                My God.         

394
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,172
    I'm, I'm actually           
    beginning to have doubts.   

395
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,273
            No.                 

396
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:27,608
                  You know, I've
                  got to hear   

397
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:28,809
                    the voice of
                    my beloved  

398
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,877
            just to reassure me.

399
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:32,162
          Uh, Woody, Woody, give
          me Rebecca's number,  

400
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,164
     and hand me the phone,     
        would you?              

401
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,334
         Oh, Dr. Crane,         
     if Miss Howe answers,      

402
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,569
  could you ask her something   
            for me?             

403
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,386
    What's that, Wood?          

404
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:42,305
Ask her if she has Prince Albert
        in a can.               

405
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,640
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

406
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,075
Don't tell her it was me.       

407
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,259
              No.               

408
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,914
                        FRASIER:
                        Hello.  

409
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:51,915
         Yeah, h-hello.         

410
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,734
      Is that you, Carla?       

411
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:55,285
        ( <i>music playing</i> )       
    Yeah, yeah, who is it?      

412
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,070
    Uh, it's Frasier.           

413
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,288
     What's all that noise?     

414
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,889
  What's going on over there?   

415
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,575
     We're making a quilt.      

416
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,710
  Well, can I speak to Lilith,  
            please?             

417
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:04,728
     Well, is it important?     

418
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:07,964
She's showing the male stripper 
    where to put his things.    

419
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,266
             What?              

420
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,552
    Oh, I-I got to get back.    

421
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:15,255
         I-I got a bet          
this guy's packing socks.       

422
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,477
 She'll call you back sometime. 

423
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,216
What happened?                  

424
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,218
          Oh, nothing.          

425
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,353
Seems Lilith                    
is indisposed at the moment.    

426
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,621
She's helping to undress        
a male stripper.                

427
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,323
( <i>guys oohing and aahing</i> )      

428
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,509
A male stripper?                

429
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:38,144
    Well, where do they put     
          the tassels?          

430
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:44,985
    The thought of my Lilith    
  having one last carnal fling  

431
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,055
  with some fellow in a Speedo  
    is beyond belief!           

432
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,106
     Now, Frasier, I mean,      

433
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,674
      just 'cause some guy      
      strips in her honor       

434
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,244
doesn't mean they're going      
to wind up in the sack together.

435
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,312
        Oh, no, no, no,         
you don't know my Lilith.       

436
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,630
I'll tell you,                  
once her libido's cut loose,    

437
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,449
I mean, there's no tying        
her down, unless, of course,    

438
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,000
that's what she's into          
for the evening.                

439
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,220
She's, right now,               
she's with him.                 

440
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,923
          Oh, no, hey, hey, come
          on, take it easy here.

441
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,692
She's with that man--           
that sweating, chiseled,        

442
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,694
                        Frasier.
pulsing, throbbing...           

443
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,312
Hey, hey, whoa.                 
sexy...                         

444
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,120
Creme de Menthe?                

445
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:24,408
You couldn't find               
some water?                     

446
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,296
    My God, Sam.                

447
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:34,067
    You realize what this...    
          this means?           

448
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:36,287
Well, I-I don't know            
the clinical term for it,       

449
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,821
but it seems to me              

450
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,690
you were going                  
a little scooters there.        

451
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,360
             I was jealous, Sam.

452
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,029
            I-I was insanely,   
            blindly jealous.    

453
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:50,033
      If ever I needed a clearer
      gut-level demonstration   

454
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,903
            of my feelings,     
            I mean, that was it.

455
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,771
    Yes, yes, it's perverted.   

456
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:58,408
             Yes, it's childish,
             but yes, it's love.

457
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,661
Maybe you ought                 
to go see her right now.        

458
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,062
                I will, Sam.    

459
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,615
             There's just one   
             matter that has to 
             be rectified first.

460
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:08,652
        Cliff, in light         
     of my recent decision,     

461
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:13,957
      I now take offense at your
      remarks about Lilith.     

462
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:17,294
      In short, I'm going       
    to kick your sorry butt.    

463
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,165
     Ah, now, come on, Doc,     
just cool down, will you?       

464
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,632
      It was just a joke.       

465
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,269
 Oh, you mean like that costume 
      you wear every day?       

466
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:27,354
             GUYS:              
             Whoa!              

467
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,776
 All right, put up your dukes,  
        Dr. Cream Puff.         

468
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,328
                Okay, now we    
                got a party, eh?

469
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:35,662
    ( <i>men laugh and agree</i> )     

470
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,931
     All right, all right,      
     uh, before we start,       

471
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:39,399
        let's just, uh,         

472
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,084
    set a few ground rules,     
        all right?              

473
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,020
  Uh, no punching in the face   

474
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,171
     because that can cause     
      severe brain damage.      

475
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,425
Oh, oh, all right, uh,          
just one other thing.           

476
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,093
Uh, no hitting                  
below the belt.                 

477
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,812
    I'm about to be married.    

478
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:53,914
Uh, all right, all right,       
fair enough, fair enough.       

479
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,119
All right,                      
well, no hitting                

480
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:00,637
in the, uh,                     
right shoulder, though.         

481
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,105
That's my bag shoulder,         
all right?                      

482
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,949
             What about the, um,
             upper thigh area?  

483
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,518
        Uh...                   

484
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:17,270
Oh, no, I think we covered that 
on page five over here.         

485
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,872
        Yeah.                   

486
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,641
             Well, then, where  
             does that leave us?

487
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:21,975
I don't know;                   
it's leaving me                 

488
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,877
with writer's cramp,            
I'll tell you.                  

489
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:25,612
            Well, let that be   
            a lesson to you.    

490
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,134
                As for me,      

491
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,603
I'm going to go back            
to my beloved,                  

492
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:34,638
      throw my arms around      
her milky-white shoulders,      

493
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,273
      and let me tell you       
      something, fellas.        

494
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,042
     I'm going to tell her      
      I'm devoted to her,       

495
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,343
    and that I'm dedicating     
  the rest of my life to her.   

496
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,179
Hello, everyone.                

497
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,416
Frasier, is that you?           

498
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,985
Good. I hope this doesn't spoil 
the bachelor party,             

499
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,854
but the engagement is off.      

500
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,373
It's over, history,             

501

 <i>kaput.</i> Good night.             

502
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:54,842
            What?!              

503
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:56,110
        She's kind of juiced.   

504
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,178
I can't be engaged              
to you, Frasier,                

505
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,180
because I'm marrying            
Randy here.                     

506
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,633
If anyone wants to get us       
a wedding gift,

508

    Why don't you sit down,     
          Dr. Sternin?          

509
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,412
Oh, "Dr. Sternin"               
is a little formal, isn't it?   

510
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:21,318
    You can call me Sheena,     
  Ruler of the Jungle of Love.  

511
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:22,635
Can somebody sober her up?      

512
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,887
    Hey, I think                
    you lost a button.          

513
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,089
              ( <i>Woody laughing</i> )

514
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,396
We'll handle it from here.      
         Thanks, Randy.         

515
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,714
 Happy to do it. There's still  
    the matter of cab fare.     

516
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:37,033
         Oh. Here, there you go.

517
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,569
Great. Thanks.                  

518
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,137
            See you.            

519
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:43,473
Oh, Randy, don't leave me.      

520
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:48,528
    I'll never be able          
to hear "Shock the Monkey" again

521
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,396
        without crying.         

522
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,403
    Lilith,                     

523
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:57,971
  what were you thinking of?!   

524
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:00,173
      I'm sorry, Frasier,       
 it's just that I felt the need 

525
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:01,608
      to get back at you.       

526
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:03,360
            I waited all evening
            for you to call     

527
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,994
        and say that the wedding
        was still on,           

528
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,129
        but you didn't, you cur.

529
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:07,313
    I did call!                 

530
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:08,949
Didn't Carla tell you?          

531
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:12,519
        She was too busy licking
        Bosco off Randy's chest.

532
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:17,174
      I became increasingly more
      distraught and foolish    

533
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,475
         as the night grew long.

534
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,278
    Of course, the 11 tequila   
    shooters didn't help.       

535
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:24,330
        And now, the epilogue   
        is that my behavior     

536
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,951
    has probably cost me        
    the one man I truly love.   

537
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,354
            Oh, you can probably
            still catch him.    

538
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:33,807
Woody, I don't think            

539
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:36,710
you're following along          
closely enough.                 

540
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,195
Listen, you're not              
the only one                    

541
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:41,565
who's behaved                   
irrationally tonight.           

542
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,235
Lilith... I want                
to marry you anyway.            

543
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:47,988
                You do?         

544
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:49,339
    Absolutely.                 

545
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,524
        For the rest of my life,

546
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,661
            I will always       
            cherish those words:

547
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:58,165
              "Lilith, I want to
              marry you anyway."

548
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:01,585
Come, my sweet.

Let's get on                    
with our life together.
