00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,500
          Here you go.          

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
                          Hey...

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,300
    Something wrong?            

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,600
                  Yes, I'll say.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,300
            You didn't ask me if
         I needed anything else.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,000
      Do you see this roll      
     of dollar bills here?      

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,000
        Yeah.                   

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,300
            This is your tip.   

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,400
 I've set it aside in advance.  

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,200
      Now here's the deal.      

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,500
         Every time you         
      do something wrong,       

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,700
I take a dollar bill, see?      

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,400
That way, I get decent service. 
          Understood?           

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,200
    Fair enough.                

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,500
Here's my deal for you.         

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,200
Every time you take away        
a dollar, I do this.            

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,300
                  That just cost
             you another dollar.

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,200
            There, you happy?   

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,900
Your tip money's all gone.      

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,100
That's just great.              
'Cause I just got my own.

        So, uh, how long is your
    brother going to be in town?

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,800
    Two weeks.                  

25

      (theme song begins)

      in the world today

 Takes everything you've got  

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,200
         Takin' a break        
    from all your worries      

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,100
 Sure would help a lot         

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,800
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,400
   Sometimes you want to go    

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,700
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,400
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,700
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,400
          The troubles         
    are all the same           

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,400
  You wanna be where everybody 
    knows your name            

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,000
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

38
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,700
   People are all the same     

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,700
  You wanna go where everybody 
    knows your name.           

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,600
I would like to nominate        

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,200
as the stupidest creature       
            on Earth            

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
  the one who awakens each day  

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,500
        to drive through        
      gridlocked traffic,       

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,300
 to sit in a windowless office  
  breathing re-circulated air,  

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,300
then returns home and collapses 
        into a stupor--         

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,400
 only to do the same damn thing 
         all over again         

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
    every day until he dies.    

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,300
    Looking forward to that     
      vacation, eh, Fras?       

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,200
 You bet. We're going to Maui.  

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,200
        (Sam screaming)         

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,400
        Still having problems   
    with the computer, Sammy?   

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
    No, I think I've figured    
        out what to do.         

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,100
  Kiss your keyboard good-bye.  

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
FRASIER:                        
Sam!                            

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Sam, Sam, give me the bat.      
         Come sit down.         

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
Now, I'm sure that Lilith would 
be delighted to help you        

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,800
             with your computer.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,100
      She tells me she has quite
    an affinity for machines.   

59
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,000
    Naturally, you could have   
 knocked me over with a feather.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What is it with these           
machines, anyway?               

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,700
Computers... faxes,             
voice mail.                     

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
You know, when I ran this       
place in the old days,          

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
I had everything                
I needed... right up here.      

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,100
              Brains, Sam?      

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,700
No, good hair.                  
Brains... (scoffs)              

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
I'm serious, you know.          

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,400
Good looks can open doors.      

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
Good hair blows them            
off their hinges.               

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,100
Sammy, what are you going       
to do about the computer?       

70
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,000
Rebecca's gonna come            
over here and fix it.           

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I just have to wait             
until she shows up.             

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,100
 What about the auto show, Sam? 

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
      Don't you want to go      
      see the new models?       

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Ah, that's all right.           

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,900
I know where they're            
staying, Woody.                 

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,600
            Uh, Sammy, we're out
                    of pretzels.

77
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,000
        Oh, sorry.              

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
        Hey, we're out          
            of pretzels.        

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,100
I think that's what I meant when
I said we were out of pretzels. 

80
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
 Sorry I was so cryptic before. 

81
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,600
    I don't understand this.    

82
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,000
    We were supposed to get     
     a big shipment today.      

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
I mean, I, ordered 20 bags      
     from the distributor.      

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,900
  I even faxed it on Rebecca's  
      stupid fax machine.       

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
        Oh, well.               

86
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,900
          "Oh, well"?!          

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,900
  Sammy, there are those of us  
    who need their pretzels.    

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
What am I supposed to do,       

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,700
  go down to the grocery store  
    and buy you some?           

90
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,000
  And get some Beer Nuts, too.  

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
      These are antiques.       

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,700
     You know, I have a yen     
    for some Cheese Doodles.    

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
                          CLIFF:
                 Hey, uh, Sammy,

94
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,500
while you're out there, will you
  pick me up some cough syrup?  

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,700
  I've got a-- little tickle.   

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
 All right, fine. I'm gonna do  
      this once, you guys,      

97
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,200
    but you gotta remember--    

98
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,000
    I'm supposed to be          
     the boss around here,      

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,200
not your errand boy.            

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,300
                  Feed my meter.

101
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
     I've got those 20 bags     
     of cement you ordered.     

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,200
         What 20 bags of cement?

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
            I ordered 20 bags   
                    of pretzels.

104
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
        I faxed my order        

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,600
                  to Amalgamated
                    Snack Foods.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,500
Oh yeah, we often               
intercept their orders          
so we can push cement.          

107
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,300
          Maybe what happened is
      I faxed the wrong company.

108
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,400
That happens all the time.      

109
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,900
            So you'll take it   
                    back for me?

110
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,600
Nope. You still got             
to pay for it.                  

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,300
Good thing it happens           
all the time.                   

112
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,500
Here, sign here. I'll           
get the rest of it.             

113
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,600
    I've got no time to do this.

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,100
        I have more important   
                things going on.

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,900
    Thanks.                     

116
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
      Woody, do something       
    with this cement.           

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,800
                Sure thing, Sam.

118
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Listen, while you're out,       
        can you pick up         

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,900
some aggregate, a water trough, 
  a shovel and a wheelbarrow.   

120
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,700
 Now, what am I going to build? 

121
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,000
    All right, here you go,     
          you clowns.           

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
    Cheese Doodles...           

123
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,900
     Beer Nuts, pretzels...     

124
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,100
          Uh, where's           
     the cough syrup, Sam?      

125
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,400
 Oh, I knew I forgot something. 

126
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,400
Geez, Sammy, tickles just don't 
go away by themselves, you know.

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,800
        I'm sorry.              

128
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,500
Oh, man, I know it's going      
to get in my ears.              

129
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,100
I just know it.                 

130
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,000
        Sam, I believe I ordered
                Cheese Doodles--

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,800
                  not "Imitation
            Puffed Cheese" food.

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
  So, I got the plain wrapped.  
     What's the difference?     

133
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,900
    "Can also be used           
     as packing material."      

134
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,100
See, it's efficient, too.       

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
        "Keep out of the        
      reach of children."       

136
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,400
                You know, Sammy,

137
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
you shouldn't have to cut       
    corners like this.          

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,800
If you're having money problems,
    maybe we can help.          

139
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
      Come here, you guys.      

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Listen, you, you remember       
that raise I gave you guys      

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,900
     a couple of weeks ago?     

142
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,200
    How much does it really     
          mean to you?          

143
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,200
                    More than my
            children's lives.   

144
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,900
      Okay, Carla gets to       
        keep her raise.         

145
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,100
     What do you say, Wood?     

146
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,700
Well, I suppose I can put       
it off a couple of months,      

147
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
if it'll help.                  

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,700
     Aw, yeah, thanks, man,     
        you're a brick.         

149
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,700
In return for this concession,  
I think the group medical plan  

150
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
should be expanded              
to include dental.              

151
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,900
      I'm just barely keeping my
          head above water here.

152
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,200
    What are you doing to me?   

153
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,100
              You're acting like
        selfish, greedy leeches.

154
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
    Well, why should we work    
        here then, huh?         

155
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
  Because we're family, honey.  

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
  Why is everybody treating me  

157
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
like I'm the biggest jerk       
        on Earth?               

158
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,000
 Don't worry about that, Sammy, 
             okay?              

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
     You're the owner here.     
You have responsibilities.      

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
If they can't handle that,      
     that's their problem.      

161
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,000
         Yeah, thanks.          

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
              Can I have another
                beer, please?   

163
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,500
I can't run a tab anymore.      

164
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,700
I'm going to have to            
take cash on this.              

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,500
      Or maybe you are the      
     biggest jerk on Earth.     

166
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,800
         Maybe you are!         

167
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Fine, you know, just fine.      

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What do you guys want           
from me, huh?                   

169
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,500
Free medical plans--            
raises all around.              

170
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,200
  How about free beer and all   
the pretzels you can eat?       

171
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,300
  Can I get you anything else?  

172
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,500
            Can we have         
          "fondue night"?       

173
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,700
        No.                     

174
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,600
  Not everybody likes fondue.   

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
              Hi.               

176
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,700
         Hi, Miss Howe.         

177
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,400
Oh, Woody, you don't work       
for me anymore.                 

178
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,300
You don't need to call          
me "Miss Howe."                 

179
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Just call me Rebecca.           

180
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,800
                Oh, hi, Rebecca.
                      (chuckles)

181
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,100
"Rebecca," I kind of like that. 

182
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,500
    What do you think, Norm?    

183
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
    Now, now, Woody. Come on.   

184
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson.        

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
It's just not me,               
Miss Howe.                      

186
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,200
Oh, great, there you are.       

187
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,000
    I can't stay long.          
I only have a few minutes.      

188
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,300
What's wrong with the computer? 

189
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
      Oh, nothing, really.      

190
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,900
        I just can't get        
those little green letters      

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
    to pop up on the screen.    

192
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,700
        Well, did you try       
             booting it up?     

193
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,100
Yeah, I did plenty of that.     

194
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,400
Sam, you can call me stupid,    

195
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
    but I think if Miss Howe    
     was still around here,     

196
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,300
     she could take care of     
all this technical stuff.       

197
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
You're stupid.                  

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,100
                I said Sam could
        call me stupid, not you.

199
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,300
          I don't know if that's
             a good idea, Woody.

200
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,900
I said you could call           
me stupid, not my idea.         

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
Doesn't anybody                 
listen around here?             

202
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,300
    You don't think I don't     
     want Rebecca back here     

203
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,400
    managing the bar?           

204
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,900
I'd love it, man, but she       

205
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,100
quit, she's never               
gonna come back here.           

206
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,600
    Well, Sam, you'll never know
unless you offer her the job.   

207
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
      Yeah, hey, how would      
         you guys feel          

208
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,400
     about Rebecca managing     
    this place again?           

209
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,100
      Well, would it raise      
    the price of beer?          

210
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,900
        No.                     

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
     Then what do we care?      

212
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,100
 All right, that's a good idea. 

213
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
    I'll offer her the job.     

214
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh, good. Did you find          
out what was wrong?             

215
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
    Yeah, the disk was          
          in backwards          

216
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,600
  and the keyboard connection   
        was loose.              

217
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,500
      Also, you had picked it up
    and thrown it on the ground.

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Wow, Rebecca, you are           

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,200
    so great. You've got this   
        real knack for managing.

220
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,900
                  What, what are
                you doing... for
            the rest of the day?

221
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,800
          What are you doing for
        the rest of the week?   

222
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,700
I'm going to work.              

223
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
You got a job?                  

224
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,300
Yeah, didn't I tell you guys?   

225
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,600
     Yeah, and it could turn out

226
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,100
                 to be something
                  real exciting.

227
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,500
Oh, wow, what're you doing?     

228
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
                    Well, I'm in
        public relations now.   

229
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,700
         Good for you.          
REBECCA:                        
Yeah.                           

230
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,500
    I mean, it doesn't mean     
    I'll never see you guys.    

231
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
    I can still come in here    
         as a customer.         

232
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
 Of course, with work and all,  
      I mean, I can't stay      

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,200
 for ten, 12 hours at a stretch 
         like you guys.         

234
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,400
Well, that's okay, you could be 
    in the part-timers club.    

235
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,900
      They sit over there.      

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,900
And when you're ready to        
commit, you'll let us know.     

237
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,800
         Yeah. Like Phil there--
        he's right on the verge.

238
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,300
      Well, I'd better get back.

239
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,600
            I've already been   
            gone ten minutes.   

240
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,300
         Ten minutes--          
she'll never make the cut.      

241
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,000
            Bye-bye.            

242
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
You know, it would've been nice 
  to have her back in the bar.  

243
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,800
 Come to think of it, you know, 

244
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,100
  how much work would there be  
     for her really to do?      

245
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,400
    I mean, do I really need    
        a manager?              

246
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,300
I've got a truckload of sorghum 
    for a Sam Malone.           

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
 I didn't say I wanted sorghum. 

248
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,700
                 I said I wanted
                "some more gum."

249
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,900
         God, I hate voice mail.

250
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,400
It's not my problem. Uh...      

251
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,100
Where do you want me            
to put this?                    

252
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,300
            I don't know.       

253
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
    What is sorghum, anyway?    

254
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,200
      Oh, it's grain, Sam.      

255
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,600
  It's used to feed livestock.  

256
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,200
So, if I put it in a bowl,      
would those guys eat it?        

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,800
                Are you kidding?

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,500
      I was late putting out the
            Beer Nuts last night

259
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,300
         and Mr. Peterson almost
        snapped off my thumb.   

260
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,100
          Fill 'em up.          

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,500
                 Woody, this new
             trail mix is great.

262
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,100
             Yeah.              

263
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,700
             Yeah, slide another
              bowl down, please.

264
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,000
You might want to mix a raw egg 
    in there, Mr. Peterson.     

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,500
Makes your coat nice and shiny. 

266
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,000
             What?              

267
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,700
          (laughing):           
          Oh, nothing.          

268
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,000
      Hey, guys, listen up      
    here for a second.          

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
    I want you to meet          
         someone here.          

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
    It's your new manager--     
         this is Earl.          

271
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
    Hey, Earl.                  
                    Hi, Earl.   

272
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
  Earl used to play shortstop   
         for the Cubs.          

273
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
                    All right...
                 one of us, huh?

274
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
     You guys from Chicago?     

275
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,000
    No. They're all losers.     

276
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,300
        (sneezes)               

277
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,200
Boy, that sounds like           

278
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,500
a nasty cold you've             
got there, son.                 

279
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
And still you're out            
there delivering the mail?      

280
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
I've got a lot of               
respect for you guys.           

281
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,300
    Sammy, give                 
    this guy a raise.           

282
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
                Earl, get out   
              from behind there.

283
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
        Come on, have a seat.   

284
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Oh, don't sit me down at a bar. 

285
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
    I'll never get up.          
                        Ah...   

286
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,100
        It's either that        
    or go home to the wife,     

287
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
and God knows I hate to do that.

288
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,900
Do you have the other half      
        of this amulet?         

289
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Looks like                      
you've found                    
a home here, Earl.              

290
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
          Oh, well, thanks, Sam.

291
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,800
 Why don't you find me an apron 
and I'll get started here?      

292
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Holy moly!                      
The man handles computers,      

293
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,300
        he tends bar...         

294
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,600
Anything you                    
need me for, son.               

295
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Whoa! Would you...              

296
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,500
                  What? What?   

297
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
...catch a look                 
at that babe there?             

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
                  Where are you?
                  Where are you?

299
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,800
In the poolroom,                
kind of behind that pole.       

300
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
                  Whoo! Boy, you
              do have good eyes.

301
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,200
             You sure you played
                  with the Cubs?

302
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,100
                Well, guys, I...
             I hope I do as well
        as your last manager.   

303
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,700
You're probably                 
going to want                   

304
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,800
to set your sights              
a wee bit higher.               

305
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,300
Come on, guys, guys, guys.      
Rebecca's doing great.          

306
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Our old manager moved on        
to bigger and better things.    

307
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
     Nothing can hurt a car     
treated with Miracle Buff.      

308
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,900
      Absolutely nothing.       

309
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,100
    Watch me pour acid          
    on this car, and wipe it    

310
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,600
        right off!              

311
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,600
        Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!         

312
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,500
            REBECCA:            
         That's right.          

313
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,300
     Nothing can penetrate      
     the mirror-like luster     

314
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
        of Miracle Buff.        

315
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,900
    Not even... fire.           

316
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,000
        (panting)               

317
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
                  You people are
              just going to have

318
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,600
             to take my word for
             it this time, okay?

319
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,400
        Ladies and gentlemen,   

320
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
  I have to take a break now,   

321
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,100
but our next demonstration      
will be in... one minute?!      

322
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,600
 I just get so afraid up there. 

323
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,100
        We're afraid for you.   

324
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,400
        But that's what makes   
      the auto show so exciting.

325
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,400
    Hey, huh? Is this great     
to cut out from work like this? 

326
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Yeah.                           

327
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
     With Earl at the bar,      
        you know,               

328
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
we can stay here all day.       

329
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,100
Oh, Sam, check it out!          
Sheepskin covers!               

330
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,300
        What are you doing, man?

331
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,700
              Why are you buying
         all this vinyl cleaner,

332
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,300
                leather cleaner?
              I mean, sheepskin?

333
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
                  You don't even
                     have a car.

334
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,600
          I know, Sam,          
    but most of my furniture    

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,100
    comes from the interior     
            of cars.            

336
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,700
I've got to be careful          
when I shave                    

337
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
because objects may             
be closer than they appear.     

338
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,900
                        REBECCA:
  Ladies and gentlemen, the next
      Miracle Buff demonstration

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
 will commence in ten seconds.  

340
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,400
Oh, my God! Look at that.       
        That's Rebecca.         

341
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
  She's working the auto show.  

342
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh, wow! She <i>does</i>               
have a great job.               

343
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,500
She's Miss Miracle Buff.        

344
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
SAM:                            
I don't think                   
she'd want us                   

345
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
     to see her like this.      

346
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,200
    Just keep out of sight.     

347
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
         Miracle Buff,          
     the amazing discovery      

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,900
that will make your car's finish
        last a lifetime.        

349
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
      For safety reasons,       

350
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,300
we can't actually simulate      
        a nuclear blast,        

351
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,100
but we have already shown       
    that acid and fire          

352
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,800
 are no match for Miracle Buff. 

353
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,900
    Unlike human skin.          

354
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,100
              Sam, I don't think
        I can keep up this pace.

355
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm still dizzy from being      
knocked in the face             

356
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,200
from that airbag demonstration. 

357
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
  I think I'm going to go over  
    to the RVs and lie down.    

358
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,700
            REBECCA:            
      Now, you're probably      
        all saying              

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,000
          to yourself,          
    "Hey, Miss Miracle Buff,    

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,300
would the same thing apply      
      to..." Boiling tar?!      

361
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
          No way! No. Forget it.

362
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,500
                 Then you get me
                some oven mitts.

363
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,000
     He won't even give me      
        any oven mitts.         

364
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,400
      I am making a lousy       
    six bucks an hour.          

365
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,100
            I mean,             
    that will not even cover    

366
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
        the skin grafts!        

367
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
  I'm not doing this anymore.   
          This is it!           

368
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,100
    You're not getting paid     
        for this.               

369
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,300
Look, buddy, I am carrying      
    a boiling bucket of tar!    

370
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,300
             It's okay. It's all
            right. It's okay.   

371
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,900
Oh, Sam, could this             
all be a bad dream?             

372
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,700
        No, honey.              
     This is the auto show.     

373
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,500
 My friends! Thanks to my buddy 
  Earl's amazing cold remedy,   

374
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,800
    you are looking at          
 the picture of perfect health. 

375
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,100
    Every sinus cavity          
  in my head is clear and dry.  

376
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,400
Well, not dry, but moist enough 
    to be comfortable.          

377
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,800
             Glad you're feeling
                 better, Cliffy.

378
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
    Eh! Thank you.              

379
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
                 Did this, uh...
              particular cold...

380
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
              Did this start out
              with a funny taste

381
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,500
                  up in the back
                  of your mouth?

382
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,100
Uh-oh! The old acid             
in the adenoids.                

383
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,200
        Scratchy throat?        

384
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,500
Yucky coating                   
on the tongue?                  

385
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,100
Sounds like an epidemic.        

386
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,700
My friends, I don't want        
to be an alarmist,              

387
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
but tonight--                   
if you live through it--        

388
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,200
is going to be the worst        
night in your entire lives.     

389
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,100
First, the cold sweats,         
the pounding headache...        

390
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,600
                  Cliff, I don't
              want to hear this.

391
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,100
Don't worry, Norm.              

392
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
In a few hours,                 
your ears will be so clogged    

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,300
you won't be able               
to hear anything.               

394
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,700
         Look, Clavin,          
     you gave us this cold,     

395
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
and I'm going to get you for it.

396
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,200
 You're not going to know when, 
    but I'll be there.          

397
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,800
Don't worry, Carla.             
I'll know when.                 

398
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll hear your liquid-filled    
lungs wheezing a mile away.     

399
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,600
Hey, hey, everybody!            

400
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
                 CARLA AND NORM:
                      Hey, Earl.

401
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Hey! Norm, do me a favor,       
        will you?               

402
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,300
  Let me know how this tastes.  

403
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
                     It's great.
                What did you do?

404
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,900
 Well, I adjusted the pressure  
          in the kegs,          

405
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
     and then I cleaned out     
         all the lines.         

406
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,100
        Earl, how do you like   
              the sound of this?

407
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,400
             Mrs. Earl Peterson.

408
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,700
                        Come on.

409
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,800
                 Think about it.
                        Come on.

410
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,500
I don't know why you guys       

411
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
are falling all over            
yourselves about this Earl.     

412
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,700
      So he's a nice guy.       
        Big deal.               

413
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,400
         Uh... Carla, excuse me.

414
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,700
  I noticed you've been carrying
         your tray a little low.

415
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,500
Are... are your shoulders tense?

416
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,000
  Let me just... if you don't   
     mind... let me just...     

417
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Oh! Oh!                         

418
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,300
That is the best                
I have ever felt                

419
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,600
without ending up               
with a baby.                    

420
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,000
It wasn't just                  
the acid, Sam.                  

421
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,500
It was the fire,                
and the simulated hailstorm,    

422
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,200
     and the live pigeons.      

423
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,000
        12 times a day,         
     I rubbed and I rubbed      

424
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
and I rubbed and I rubbed.      

425
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Come on, Miss Howe.             
The auto show couldn't          
have been that bad.             

426
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,600
      Woody, I don't have       
     any fingerprints left!     

427
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,400
Sit in here and calm down.      

428
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,900
      Rebecca was working       
    at the auto show?           

429
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,900
Yeah. She was                   
Miss Miracle Buff.              

430
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,800
Don't let the fancy             
title fool you.                 

431
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,600
She was pitching snake oil      
like a sideshow geek.           

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
                          Woody?
                What did she do?

433
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
Well, as near as I could tell,  

434
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
everything but bite the head    
off a live chicken.             

435
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,900
Of course, we got there late.   

436
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,100
          It's an indestructible
         space-age polymer, Sam,

437
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
            and it's in my hair.

438
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,700
Why didn't you come to us?      

439
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean, come on. The auto show? 

440
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
     Because I was ashamed,     

441
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,800
      and I really wanted       
      to find a good job.       

442
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
Oh, honey, I know, I know.      

443
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
            It's just that no   
        corporation will hire me

444
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,100
                because of my   
         involvement with Robin.

445
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,500
I mean, it was either that or...

446
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,100
or selling myself on the street.

447
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,400
        All right,              
  so I made the wrong choice.   

448
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,900
         Listen. Uh...          
      whatever, you know?       

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,100
You've got a job here           
managing, if you want.          

450
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,000
             I do?              

451
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
             Yeah.              

452
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
      Oh, Sam, thank you.       

453
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,400
  I'll do a great job for you.  

454
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,200
 ...jolly good fellow,         
for Earl's a jolly good fellow 

455
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,200
 For Earl's                    
a jolly good fellow...         

456
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Shoot!                          

457
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
I forgot about Earl.            

458
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,700
          Who is Earl?          

459
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,000
A jolly good fellow.            

460
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,500
     Oh, I know that, Sam.      

461
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,400
     He's working here now.     

462
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,200
                He's, uh... he's
                a real nice guy.

463
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,000
                We all got close
            to him real fast.   

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,100
              He's like a father
            figure to all of us.

465
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
    Are-Are you sure you gave   
         the auto show a chance?

466
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
        Sam!                    

467
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
        Kid, you've got the job.

468
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
        You've got the job.     
This is swell.                  

469
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
      And, you know, I bet      
     I'll grow to love Earl     

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
          just as much          
    as everybody else does.     

471
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,300
    Hmm...                      
        So what do you want     
          me to do first?       

472
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,200
        Fire Earl.              

473
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
NORM:                           
You fired Earl!                 

474
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,400
    Norm! Norm! Norm! Norm!     

475
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,900
              Sam,              

476
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
            did you send this   
                poor little lady

477
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
            out here to fire me?

478
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,600
              No.               

479
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,800
    All right, I could          
    never lie to you, Earl.     

480
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,400
  Yes. Yes. But don't you see?  

481
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
        Rebecca's our friend,   
          and she needs the job,

482
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,500
              and I can't afford
            to hire both of you.

483
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,900
    I'm sure you can go out     
    and get a job someplace.    

484
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
                 Well, of course
                     I can, Sam.

485
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
             I just wish you had
              told me to my face

486
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,500
             instead of handling
                    it this way.

487
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
             I'm... I'm a little
            disappointed in you.

488
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,400
     Please don't say that.     

489
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,700
             I'm more than happy
                  to step aside.

490
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,500
          I understand          
the importance of loyalty.      

491
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,700
You know, I always believe      
that the only way               

492
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,400
to run a business               
or a friendship                 

493
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
    or, hell, a life,           

494
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,100
    is through loyalty          
and commitment to other people. 

495
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,300
        Gee, that's just what my
      father always used to say.

496
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,400
        Ah. Your father         
    was right, missy.           

497
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,800
         Hey, why don't         
      you pick up a phone       

498
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,500
      and give him a call?      

499
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,700
Well, so long, everybody.       

500
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Bye!                            
                      Bye, Earl!
    Good-bye!                   

501
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,500
Well, back to work.             

502
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,300
      Sammy, that was Earl      
 that just walked out of here!  

503
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,000
         (all yelling)          

504
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,500
I know, I know that, I... but I 
had to hire Rebecca back.       

505
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,000
Come on, she's our friend.      

506
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
  I can't afford both of them.  
         Don't you see?         

507
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
      I mean, I had to go       
with the personal decision here.

508
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
I'm sorry. I just hope          
you can live with it.           

509
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
NORM:                           
Wait, wait.                     
Sam! Sam!                       

510
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,300
         One question.          
                        What?   

511
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,500
         Is this going          
  to raise the price of beer?   

512
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,400
              No.               

513
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,900
     Then what do we care?      

514
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,700
     Welcome back, Rebecca.     

515
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,100
           For she's           
     a jolly good fellow       

516
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,400
       For she's a jolly       
         good fellow           

517
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,500
 For she's a jolly             
good fellow...                 
  Shut up! I can't hear Daddy!
