(phone ringing)

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,074
SAM (on answering machine):
Hi. This is Cheers.

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,542
Leave a message at the beep.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,610
(beep)

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,614
Norm, this is Vera.
Please pick up.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,718
Norm! Norm?

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,420
(line disconnects)

00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:25,491

00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,531
VERA:
Norm, I know you're there.

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,467
Pick up the phone, Norm.

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,736
It's 3:00 in the morning.

15
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,572
I want you to come home.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,940
Norm?

17
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,876
Norm!

18
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,978

00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,690
Hi, Sam.
This is Vera Peterson again.

23
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,026
Listen, uh, ignore
those messages.

24
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:06,198
It turns out Norm was here in
bed next to me the whole time.

25
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:11,437
And I thought
that big lump was our dog.

26
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,771
Who knew?

The furnace is
definitely out.

44
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,650
Any luck trying to get through
to the repairman?

45
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,985
No, it's still busy.

46
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,721
Well, why don't you try
calling someone else?

47
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,989
What kind of manager are you

48
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,924
if you can't handle
a simple problem like that?

49
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,959
Sam, these are the only people
in Boston

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,829
who can service that Guatemalan
furnace you bought on sale.

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,431
Oh. Keep trying.

52
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,269
It's ringing. Hello?
Hi, there.

53
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,104
Uh, yes, our furnace
is on the blink.

54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,275
Um, it's the Little Diablo
model, the grey one.

55
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,246
It's a full duct,
forced-air model. Huh?

56
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,950
Um, let's see... 55,000 BTUs.

57
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,220
BTUs.

58
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,522
Well, how do I know
what that stands for?

59
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,559
You're the Guatemalan!

60
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,794
Carla, good news.

61
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,730
I've, uh, given
a lot of thought,

62
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,365
and I've decided
to offer my employees

63
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,033
a, uh, group medical plan.

64
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,435
Oh, man, that's
great, Sammy,

65
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,603
Yeah.
What changed your mind?

66
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,971
Oh, it's the right thing to do.

67
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,040
You guys need it,
you deserve it...

68
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,675
it's important to you.

69
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,111
Plus, they passed
some kind of law.

70
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,815
All right, the thing is--
fellows, listen up.

71
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,584
SAM:
To qualify for

72
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,320
the group rate, I need one more
person to sign on.

73
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,988
PAUL:
Thank God, Sam.

74
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,290
You don't know what it's like
to walk around uninsured,

75
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,027
knowing you might get hit
by a bus or need an operation,

76
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,529
and they'd take your house
and your, your savings,

77
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,964
and that might
not even be enough.

78
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,632
You saved my life, Sam.

79
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,869
Actually, Paul, I was kind of
thinking of offering it to Norm.

80
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,873
Hey, congratulations, Norm.

81
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,779
Woody, why do I have
to have this bag on my hand?

82
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,581
It's for the
grand unveiling.

83
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,749
Hi, Kelly.

84
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,284
Why do you have that bag
on your hand?

85
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,019
It's to cover up
the beautiful engagement ring

86
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,421
that Woody just bought me.

87
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,992
Oh, way to be
anticlimactic, Kelly!

88
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,261
There, ta-dah.

89
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,364
Wow, what a beauty!

90
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,467
So, uh, what's going on
over here, you guys, huh?

91
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,737
Yeah, we saw Kelly coming in
with a bag on her hand.

92
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,739
Yeah, it's for the
grand unveiling of
her engagement ring.

93
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,007
Oh, damn.

94
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,509
We thought there was
gonna be a puppet show.

95
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,312
Well, I've got to
get going, Woody.

96
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,549
I'm meeting my lawyer about
the prenuptial agreement. Bye.

97
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,953
You, you guys have
a prenuptial agreement?

98
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,156
Sure. Oh, I love her,
but I'm not stupid.

99
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,626
God forbid,
things don't work out.

100
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,862
I don't want
to lose half my stuff.

101
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,898
Good thinking, Woody.

102
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,201
NORM: So, uh, Wood,
that's a nice ring.

103
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,602
Have her parents
seen it yet?

104
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,237
No. They will
in a couple days.

105
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,939
They're gonna throw us
an engagement party.

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,607
A party!
Oh, cool!

107
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,377
Her grandmother's even coming
all the way from Florida.

108
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,711
She's kind of the head
of the family.

109
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,413
From what I hear,
she's pretty scary.

110
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,081
She's bossy, mean
and tough as nails.

111
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,683
You wouldn't want
to mess with her.

112
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,419
Yeah? Bet you my ma
could take her.

113
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,422
Gloves or bare fists, open hand,
closed hand, I don't care.

114
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,426
Well, I've drawn up a list
of names of the people

115
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,128
I want to invite
to the party.

116
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,797
The only problem is,
I only get to invite a few.

117
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,532
Where do you
draw the line?

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,668
Well, Woody, something that
Lilith and I find helpful

119
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,537
when we plan a party is to
simply start at the bottom

120
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,806
of the list, and eliminate
the least desirable.

121
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,309
Okay. Cranes are out.

122
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,746
Thanks, Dr. Crane.

123
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,782
<i>That was helpful.</i>

124
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,922
So, uh, Woodso, how much did
your ring set you back?

125
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,058
Well, they say when you buy
an engagement ring,

126
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,727
you're supposed to spend the
equivalent of six months salary,

127
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:06,432
but it looked kind of naked
without a diamond in it.

128
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,600
So how much we talking?
Over a grand or what?

129
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,036
Well, the salesman said that
it's bad luck for the couple

130
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,539
to know how much
the ring cost.

131
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,611
Woody, how are you
gonna afford that
on your salary?

132
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,547
Don't worry, Sam.
I'm getting a night job.

133
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,249
You, you're gonna
go do another job

134
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,685
after you leave here
at 2:30 in the morning?

135
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,388
Yep! Graveyard shift.

136
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,389
Where?

137
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,192
Graveyard, Sam.

138
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,763
Gee whiz, say
good night, Gracie.

139
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,867
Maintenance sticker?

140
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,169
I don't know.
It's pretty dark in there.

141
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,704
REBECCA: All right,
hold on a second.

142
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,245
Carla, hand me the phone!

143
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,582
Here you go.

144
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,649
Thank you.

145
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,984
All right,
I'm wiping off

146
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,819
the maintenance
sticker now.

147
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,224
REBECCA:
Well, according to this, the
heater was last serviced...

148
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,926
This heater has
never been serviced.

149
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,895
I guess you don't
need to bring a...

150
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,163
Carla, what
are you doing?

151
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,331
Carla, what is
that noise?

152
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,933
Well, I'm putting
this grate back on.

153
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,568
You know, it's
a little dangerous

154
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,504
to have it lying
around out here.

155
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,739
Carla!

156
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,940
Now this is not funny!

157
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,810
You let me out of
here right now!

158
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,379
Oh, fine!
I'm gonna call the police!

159
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,183
Boy, you know, one of our
patrons could trip on this wire.

160
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,054
Oh, great!

161
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,723
Now the phone
doesn't work either!

162
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,962
All right, it's closing time!
(rings bell)

163
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,732
Everybody out. Mr. Peterson,
Mr. Clavin, come on. Let's go.

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,733
I'm already late.

165
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,569
Come on.
I mean, the bar closes at 2:00.

166
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,571
It's just now... 2:30.

167
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,541
Tonight's my first night
at the graveyard.

168
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,309
I don't want to be late,
all right?

169
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,144
Now, come on, you guys
really got to go.

170
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,312
Let's go.
Come on.

171
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,580
Woody! Woody! Woody!
Hold it! Hold it!

172
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,082
What's the rush?

173
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,651
It's not like your customers
are going to be going anywhere.

174
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,620
Huh?
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,291
But you know, it is going to be
awfully lonely out there, Wood.

176
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,659
CLIFF:
Oh, no, now,
don't worry.

177
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,160
You'll have
plenty of company.

178
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:20,132
They won't be too talkative,
what with their lips sewn shut.

179
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,901
Well, you don't actually have
to see the bodies, do you?

180
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,470
I mean, they're in the coffins,
right?

181
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,738
Oh, yeah, most of them are.

182
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,039
The ones that can afford it.

183
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,377
Yeah, the rest of them,
they, uh, put in body bags

184
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,113
or sometimes just a big roll
of blotting paper.

185
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,782
Sometimes they're
just laying about

186
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,451
arms and legs akimbo.

187
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,155
Yeah, their lips drawn
in a ghastly rictus.

188
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,492
I don't know what rictus means,
Mr. Clavin.

189
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,094
You will by sunup, my lad.

190
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,497
Cut it out, guys.

191
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,699
All right, come on.
We'd better toodle along now.

192
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,100
All right, come on.

193
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,736
You know, I understand that,
Norm, the brain stays alive

194
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,172
long after the body's
lying in a coffin.

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,176
CLIFF:
Yeah, poor desperate soul
in there trying to scream out,

196
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,512
"Don't bury me!
I'm not dead yet!"

197
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,946
NORM:
And all they can muster

198
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,482
is one final
frantic gurgle.

199
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,784
Oh, the gurgle!

200
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,519
Listen for that
gurgle, Woody.

201
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,887
You listen for
that gurgle.

202
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:18,190
Hey, you guys are just
trying to scare me, right?

203
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,892
Forget it.
I got a job to do.

204
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,860
I've got a ring to pay for.
Get out.

205
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,830
(gurgling voice):
Good night!

206
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,199
See ya!
Good night, Mr. Peterson,
Mr. Clavin.

207
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,202
(gurgling voice):
Want to take a cab?

208
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:37,076
Oh, man, buried alive.
Give me a break!

209
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,845
REBECCA
(echoey voice):
Woody!

210
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,014
Will someone let
me out of here?!

211
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,716
(screaming)

212
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,585
Mr. Peterson! Mr. Clavin!

213
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,797
Excuse me, miss.

214
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,399
I've been sent
to collect some specimens.

215
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,202
Oh, they're sitting over there
on the other side of the bar.

216
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,705
No, I'm from
the insurance company.

217
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,841
I need to do a blood sample
on each employee.

218
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,910
Oh. Well, he works here.
Take him first.

219
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,078
MAN:
Fine.

220
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,381
Shall we go?

221
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,316
Yeah. What, uh, part
of the body do you need

222
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,317
to take blood from?

223
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,585
Any part that's
soft and fleshy.

224
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,520
Well, have I got
a treat for you!

225
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,693
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

226
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,898
Woody, man,
you look terrible!

227
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,401
Yeah, I came straight
from the graveyard.

228
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,970
This is the
worst night yet.

229
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,204
Why was that,
there, Wood?

230
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,173
Well, a couple of guys
called in sick,

231
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,975
and then, uh, we couldn't seem

232
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,111
to bury old Mrs. Jane Van Der
Hooven, beloved wife and mother.

233
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,147
It was like she didn't
want to go down.

234
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,550
First the backhoe broke,

235
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,786
and we had to dig
the hole by hand.

236
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,654
And then the ground
was frozen

237
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,390
and, uh, broke the handle
on the shovel.

238
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,727
And then the coffin
kept popping open.

239
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,028
You...

240
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,330
You never get used
to that, Sam.

241
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:09,001
I don't suppose
you do.

242
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,669
And then when
we finally buried

243
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,572
old Mrs. Jane Van Der Hooven,
beloved wife and mother,

244
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,877
there was, uh, this strange
gurgling sound and...

245
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:23,215
I knew it was probably just old
Gus finishing his shake, but...

246
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,883
uh, you don't want
to take chances

247
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:25,984
on something like that.

248
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,554
So, I had to dig her up

249
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,289
and check it.

250
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,426
What a night.

251
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,061
I don't think you're
gonna make it, man.

252
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,129
This job's gonna kill you.

253
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,430
WOODY:
Oh, Sam,
I gotta earn

254
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,700
enough money
to pay for the ring.

255
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,702
(sobbing)

256
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,041
It helps to do that
every now and then.

257
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,716
Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

258
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:58,884
Who's next?

259
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,553
How about you?

260
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,422
No, uh, actually
I don't work here.

261
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,324
I'm just one of the moms
in the neighborhood

262
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,658
who comes in to help out.

263
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,995
Take him.

264
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:10,996
Woody, wake up.

265
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,698
The man's waiting for you.

266
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:13,999
Do you work here?

267
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,434
WOODY:
Yeah. I'm sorry
I'm late.

268
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,236
Let's go take
some blood.

269
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,571
Just for being late?

270
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,408
Well, that's the
toughest job I ever had.

271
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,378
<i>Man, no way I'm gonna
let that quack jab me.</i>

272
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,347
Carla, there's really
nothing to be afraid of.

273
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,748
It's, it's a very
simple process.

274
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,983
H-Here. Let
me show you.

275
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,051
Darling, may I?

276
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,553
They'll simply take your arm.

277
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,221
They'll have you make a fist.

278
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,890
Then they'll place
a tourniquet here,

279
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,893
exposing a vein.

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,195
Exposing a vein...

281
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,401
<i>Lilith, exactly
how do you work?</i>

282
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,574
WOODY: All right,
where's my money?

283
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,709
MAN:
What?

284
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,911
Come on, come on,
you know the routine.

285
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,112
I-I-I did this earlier.

286
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,747
I give you blood,
you give me money.

287
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,282
You gave blood
already today?

288
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,683
WOODY:
I didn't give it--
I sold it.

289
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,919
Hey, I got a ring
to pay for, damn you.

290
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,222
FRASIER:
Woody, are you saying
that after four days

291
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,524
of virtually no sleep at all,
you gave blood today twice?

292
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,726
Is that bad?

293
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,128
Yes! The body can't take
that kind of punishment.

294
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,597
You're suffering from a lack
of blood and a lack of sleep.

295
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,367
My God, I'm surprised
you're not hallucinating.

296
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,336
Huh. Don't worry about me,
Dr. Crane. I'm fine.

297
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,671
I just need a little sleep

298
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,840
before that party
tomorrow night.

299
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,009
Huh! Hallucinating.

300
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,349
Woody. Why aren't you
dressed for the party?

301
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,351
What party?

302
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,552
Who are you?

303
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,554
Why am I covered
with ants?!

304
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,126
Hey, Kelly.
What happened?

305
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,894
I thought the party
was tomorrow night.

306
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,562
Oh, Woody, didn't you tell them?

307
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,198
I called you days ago and told
you there was a change in plans.

308
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,234
Don't you remember?

309
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,236
Well, I remember
you called me days ago,

310
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,805
and I remember you said
there was a change in plans.

311
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,840
But I don't know what
you're talking about.

312
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,077
But, okay, let's go.

313
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,912
All right, pal.
Pal, pal.

314
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,248
You're not in any condition
to go to this party.

315
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,482
I have to go, Sam.

316
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,750
I can't disappoint Kelly.

317
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:12,818
She's the woman I love.

318
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,756
Which one is she, Sam?

319
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,435
Sit down here,
Woody.

320
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,070
Uh, why don't we catch up
with you?

321
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,072
It'll give Woody a chance
to change his clothes

322
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,406
and pull himself together.

323
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,741
Actually, Sam,

324
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,409
that's probably
a good idea.
Yeah.

325
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,345
Woody is acting kind
of out of it tonight.

326
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,879
I mean, he's fumbling around

327
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,349
like he doesn't know where he is
or what he's talking about.

328
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,351
Have you two met?

329
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,021
I'll see you
soon, Woody.

330
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,457
Here you go, Woody.

331
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,791
Whoa, whoa-hoa-hoa.
Here.

332
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,892
Come on,
come on, come on.

333
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,761
Pull yourself together.
Have some coffee.

334
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,931
Boy, it's true
what they say.

335
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,433
Caffeine does
get you going.

336
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,936
Uh, I figure I've got
about a half hour

337
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,104
to make a good impression

338
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,039
before my skin
starts to blister.

339
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,741
You know...

340
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,578
Uh-uh-uh.

341
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,946
Keep your distance.

342
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,315
I'm not afraid to use
this thing, you know.

343
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,383
Oh, for
heaven's sake.

344
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,450
Look, allow me.

345
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,718
Perhaps I can be of
some assistance.

346
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,987
Carla, Carla,
please.

347
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,156
Now let's just...

348
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,824
Look into my eyes.

349
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,593
Listen very carefully
to every word I say.

350
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,596
All he's going to do is
plunge this large-bore needle

351
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,364
into your tissue

352
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,999
until it reaches a vein,

353
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,734
at which point the
beating of your heart

354
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,404
will cause your blood
to gush into this vial,

355
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,740
filling it
with a viscous,
crimson syrup.

356
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,908
(moaning gasp)

357
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,009
(body thuds)

358
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,445
There you go.
Top her off.

359
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,447
Thank you.
My pleasure.

360
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,187
SAM:
How're you
doing, pal?

361
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,755
WOODY:
Oh, fine, Sam.

362
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,023
That nap in the car

363
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,358
on the way over
really helped.

364
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,126
I got my second wind.

365
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,394
Woody...

366
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:03,829
good to see you.

367
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,999
WOODY:
Oh. Good to see you, too,
Mr. Gaines, sir.

368
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,567
Uh, how do you do,
Mr. Gaines? I'm Sam...

369
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,202
No, don't introduce
yourself to me.

370
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,637
Oh, that's right.
We've met.

371
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,340
No. I just don't
care who you are.

372
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,081
Delicious.
Mmm. Mmm.

373
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,615
Oh.

374
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,951
I see you gentlemen
are enjoying the
smoked tongue.

375
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,657
Ugh!

376
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,659
Look at us, Cliff.

377
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,327
All the years
of pretzels

378
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,996
and potato chips at
the bar have ruined us.

379
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,666
Finally get a chance to
broaden our horizons a bit,

380
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,935
educate our palate,
what do we do?

381
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,636
We act like a couple
of bar goons

382
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,805
at a rich
man's party.
Hey, Norm.

383
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,774
(barking)

384
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,978
Woody, I'm so
glad you're here.

385
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,147
Grandmother can't
wait to meet you.

386
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,649
And I can't wait
to meet her, Kelly Gaines.

387
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,252
Is he okay?

388
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,587
Yeah, he's fine.
He's just, uh,

389
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,355
been working
24 hours a day

390
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,190
for the past four days.

391
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,792
Is that a lot?

392
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,827
I'm not part of
the work force.

393
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,965
KELLY:
Oh, look. There's
grandmother now.

394
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,402
Oh, my God, Sam.

395
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,703
Save me.
What? What?

396
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:18,837
It's Mrs. Jane Van
Der Hooven,

397
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,272
beloved wife
and mother.

398
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
Who?

399
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,108
WOODY:
The dead woman

400
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,076
from last night.

401
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,210
I could never
forget her face.

402
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,378
Oh, come on, Woody.

403
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,813
I should know. I dug
her up three times.

404
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,847
Hey, Woody,
Woody, Woody.

405
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:29,948
Stop it, man.

406
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,083
You're hallucinating.
No.

407
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,751
Remember what Frasier
said about lack of sleep?

408
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,720
That's her, Sam.
No. Woody,

409
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,889
it is, it is
Kelly's grandmother.

410
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,924
No. Check her head for
a shovel-shaped dent.

411
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,226
I'm not saying we did it,
but, okay, it was late,

412
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,095
and we got a
little careless.

413
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,129
Why are you
interrogating me?

414
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,898
I'm not on trial here.
Shh.

415
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,534
You're Woody Boyd,
aren't you?

416
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,136
See, Sam?
She remembers me.
Oh...

417
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,206
Kelly has told me
so much about you.

418
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,108
So you're interested
in getting married.

419
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:59,044
Perhaps you and I should
have a little talk--

420
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,446
in private.

421
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,814
That's a good idea.

422
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,449
We should sit down
and do that sometime.

423
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,050
Well, no time
like the present.

424
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,820
Why don't you join
me in the library?

425
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,822
Right in here.

426
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,295
Tell my parents
I love them.

427
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,531
NORM:
All right, buddy.

428
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,567
I've got one.
I've got one.

429
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,869
Little Orphan Annie.

430
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,739
CLIFF:
Oh...

431
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,807
that's a good one, Normie,
but I didn't see it

432
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,809
'cause I've got cataracts.

433
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,480
Hey, hey, guys,
look at his.

434
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,614
(growling)

435
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,915
Oh, Sammy,

436
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,050
come on. Tongue
jokes were funny

437
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,351
like a half hour ago.

438
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,288
Don't just stand
there, young man.

439
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,592
Come on and sit down beside me.

440
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,869
Are you cold?

441
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,604
I'm freezing.

442
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,106
I seem to be cold all the time
these days.

443
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,708
(wry chuckle)

444
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,677
Feel my hand.

445
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,616
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not.

446
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,554
Are you afraid of me,
young man?

447
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,456
What? Me?
Yeah.

448
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,791
Scared? You?

449
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,626
(laughs)
Never!

450
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,461
What crazy talk.

451
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,796
Oh!

452
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,633
Well, I can't think
of any reason

453
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:31,136
why a fine, young, strong,
healthy, young man like you

454
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,640
should be afraid
of a helpless, old lady like me,

455
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,010
unless it's because you tried
to bury me alive last night.

456
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,978
(moans)
(screams)

457
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,347
(moans)

458
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,682
What?

459
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,017
Come on, I was
kidding, man.

460
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,085
What are you
doing?

461
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,553
Sam, I hit her
with a shovel

462
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,787
and she's come back
for me.

463
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,822
What?!

464
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,924
And you fell for it.

465
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,794
Mother, what are
you talking about?

466
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,129
(laughs)

467
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,665
I was just having fun
with the young man.

468
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,066
I got the idea

469
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,102
when I heard that he was
working in the graveyard.

470
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,004
It was just too rich
to pass up.

471
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,271
Wait a minute.

472
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,873
How-how'd you find
out about that?

473
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,843
Oh, that's the wonderful thing
about a hearing aid.

474
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,345
When you turn it up, you can
hear all kinds of things.

475
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,713
Incidentally,

476
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,482
Elliott, you're out of the will.

477
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,486
Sorry, Elliott.

478
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,988
You mean this was
all a joke?

479
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,656
That's right.

480
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,658
Well, you crazy old...
Hey, hey, hey, Wood...

481
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,926
KELLY:
Woody, what
are you doing?!

482
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,561
That's it, Woody.
Get him out of here.

483
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,563
Hold it!

484
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,032
(clears throat)

485
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,034
This young man,

486
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,870
this young man
may be gullible--

487
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,873
oh, well, let's
be honest, slow--

488
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,143
but he had the backbone
to stand up to me,

489
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,644
which no one else
in the family

490
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,179
has ever had
the courage to do.

491
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,548
I think you're going to
be very good for Kelly.

492
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:52,184
In fact, I think you're going
to be good for all of us.

493
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,752
I give you my blessing.

494
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,521
Welcome to the family.

495
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,089
Now, let's eat.

496
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,695
Can I go to sleep now?

497
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,763
Sure.

498
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,183
Say, uh, Rebecca,

499
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,918
for ten bucks I'll tell you
how to get even with Carla,

500
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,921
for closing you
up in the wall.

501
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,290
Okay.

502
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,127
Here's her purse.

503
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,528
Toss it back
into the duct.

504
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,863
When she goes in after it,

505
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,498
screw the vent cover
back on.
Oh,

506
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:40,699
that's a good idea.

507
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,768
Whoo!

508
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,636
(laughs)
Whoa!

509
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,138
Wait a minute.

510
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:48,140
<i>That's my purse.
Oh!</i>

511
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:51,010
I'm sorry.
Oh...

512
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,277
God.

513
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,015
(straining)
