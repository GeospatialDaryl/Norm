1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,676
How about a beer, chief?

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,630
How about an ID?

3
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,516
An ID?

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,513
That's very flattering!

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,032
Wait till I tell the missus.

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,833
Military ID.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,509
First Sergeant Walter Keller,
born 1944.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,151
That makes you 38.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,354
- Must've fought in Vietnam.
- Yeah.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,597
- What was it like?
- It was gross.

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,956
Yeah, that's what they say.
War is gross.

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,476
I'm sorry, soldier.

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,951
This is the thanks we get.

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,350
Sumner, this is crazy.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,630
Diane, we're about to be married.

16
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,991
Married! Congratulations!
Let's celebrate with a drink.

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,792
I think not.

18
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,194
I give it six months.

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,712
Perhaps we won't have children
right away.

20
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,029
- Come on. Let's sit here.
- We have a plane to catch.

21
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,075
I insist you have my grandmother's
antique gold wedding ring.

22
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,990
Didn't you say it's still on your
ex-wife's finger? I don't need it.

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,511
- You're enough for me.
- True. But symbols are important.

24
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,997
Let me call Barbara and see if
she's home. The phone's back here.

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,477
As long as we're here,
let's celebrate with some champagne.

26
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,396
Hello? Sam?

27
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,239
Are you Sam?

28
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,316
- Yes.
- Yes, he's here.

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,634
Someone named Vicki.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,318
No.

31
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,313
No, she knows you're here.
I told her you're here.

32
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,919
Well...

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,471
Now, look...

34
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,076
I'm sorry, I was wrong.
He had to step out.

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,235
Where?

36
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,110
Well, I think what happened is he...

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,154
...he had... to go to mime class.

38
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,434
Yes, I'll take a message.

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,473
You're welcome.

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,159
- Well?
- You're a magnificent pagan beast.

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,157
Thanks. What's the message?

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,276
Listen, I didn't like doing that.

43
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,518
I'm sorry. If I didn't own
this place, I'd fire me on the spot.

44
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,200
For lying for me,
I'll buy you your first drink.

45
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,274
I'd like a bottle
of your best champagne.

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,356
It wasn't that great a lie.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,788
- No, we'll pay for it.
- We're on our way to get married.

48
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,230
Then this is on me. Congratulations.

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,033
Barbara was home.
She said I can come over.

50
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,991
Well, do you want me to go with you?

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,588
No, it could get a trifle sticky.

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,599
Besides, if she saw the dazzling
beauty who's about to succeed her,

53
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,517
it would break her heart again.

54
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,596
Sumner, I'm not beautiful.

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,199
Blasphemy.

56
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,675
So where's the ceremony gonna be?

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,076
- Tomorrow, in Barbados.
- Nice.

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,636
I'm Dr Sumner Sloane, Professor
of World Literature at the U.

59
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,591
He has an article in <i>Harper's.</i>

60
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,518
Diane's been my teaching assistant
for two years.

61
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,473
Today, I was sitting in my office
with Diane.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,275
I looked up from my Proust,
she had her nose in her Yeats.

63
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,514
I said to myself, "I would be crazy
to let this girl get out of my life."

64
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,791
So, right there on the spot,
I said, "Let's get married."

65
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,674
What he actually said was,
"Come with me and be my love,

66
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,394
and we will
some new pleasures prove."

67
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,432
- That's Donne.
- I certainly hope so.

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,871
No. John Donne, the poet.

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,551
Well, that's lovely.

70
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,558
Listen, I must dash.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

71
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,069
- Excuse me, what's your name?
- Sam.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,829
Listen, Sam, old man,
I have an errand to run.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,670
Diane will stay here. I'd appreciate
it if you would keep an eye on her.

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,031
For you, Sumner, old man,
I'll keep both my eyes on her.

75
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,156
Sumner, am I stupid to let you go see
a woman you were once in love with?

76
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,158
Darling,
I'm leaving you alone in a bar.

77
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,556
- Which one of us is the stupider?
- Too close to call.

78
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,877
In any case, you sit at the bar
and chat with Sam while I'm gone.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,992
I'll be back before you know it
with your wedding ring.

80
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,108
He's quite a fella, your fiancé.

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,199
Listen, you don't have to
make conversation with me.

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,118
I'm not in the habit
of talking with bartenders.

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,277
I understand. One's trying
to move into my neighbourhood.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,159
Call that a football team?

85
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,750
- What's wrong, Coach?
- The Patriots did it again.

86
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,030
This is the worst draft yet.

87
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,037
They got a first-round pick.

88
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
Did they get a jackrabbit
for the backfield? No.

89
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,628
A gunslinger at quarterback? No.
A linebacker they get.

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,354
I've seen a good linebacker
turn a team around.

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,038
Yeah, me, too.

92
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,236
- Hi.
- Hello.

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,033
I hope nobody told you
the bus goes by here.

94
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,435
She'll be here for a while.

95
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,429
Excuse me. I hate to keep asking
for special attention,

96
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,836
but could you not discuss
my private life with everyone?

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,270
- What would you like me to tell him?
- I don't care.

98
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,149
- She's a hooker.
- Yeah?

99
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,390
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

100
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,636
- Carla's late again.
- Nuts.

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,512
OK, I'm late! My kid was throwing up
all over the place.

102
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,471
You don't buy that excuse, I quit.

103
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,637
I don't work for a man who has
no compassion for my children.

104
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,991
And you're not exactly swamped here.
I'm usually punctual.

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,476
If you don't like it, fine.
This ain't such a great job.

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,589
I'm gonna change.

107
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,237
Think I was too hard on her?

108
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,717
- Hiya, Coach.
- Hi, Carla.

109
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,593
Patriots finally got
the linebacker they needed.

110
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,712
Are you nuts? They're up to
their ears in linebackers!

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,752
That's true. They do have a lot.

112
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,311
I love to see a woman

113
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,432
who isn't afraid
to take her luggage out for a drink.

114
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,157
She doesn't want to be disturbed.

115
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,234
Well, tell Her Nibs I'm sorry.

116
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,873
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,549
- Norm, what do you know?
- Not enough.

118
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,114
What do you think
of the Patriots' draft?

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,629
They need linebackers
like I need antlers.

120
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,558
That new linebacker will put 'em
in the Super Bowl.

121
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,355
He'll probably do that.
I got an awful headache.

122
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,395
Sox lost again today, Sam.
Sure could have used you.

123
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,272
Not in the shape I'm in, Norm.

124
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,674
You, miss!

125
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,675
Wouldn't you love to see Sammy
flinging the horsehide?

126
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,994
Flinging what?

127
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,511
Don't you know who he is? He was
one of the best pitchers in baseball.

128
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,074
Samuel "Mayday" Malone.

129
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,153
I coached this kid in double-A ball,
and with the Red Sox.

130
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,272
He was one of the best
Little Leaguers ever.

131
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,790
- Take it easy, Coach.
- No, I mean it, he was the best.

132
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,753
- Sure as the earth is round.
- You don't believe that.

133
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,079
I didn't until I saw those pictures
from the space shuttle.

134
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,151
Sam once struck out Cash, Kaline and
Freehan with a tying run on second.

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
How long is the wimp convention
in town?

136
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,036
Carla, heel.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,072
If you were so good,
why aren't you still playing?

138
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,318
I developed an elbow problem.
I bent it too much.

139
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,759
You were a drunk?

140
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,236
Are you kidding?
He was a great drunk.

141
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,918
Anything he did, it was great.

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,669
I was not a great drunk.
I was a good drunk.

143
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,358
Are you drunk now?

144
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,391
I haven't had a drink in three years.

145
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,672
I'm proud you licked it, Sammy.
Must've been hell.

146
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,357
- Why do you own a bar?
- I bought it when I was a drunk.

147
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,994
I held on to it
for sentimental reasons.

148
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,669
You, miss. What you reading?

149
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,199
A book?

150
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,032
Excuse me. Where is your bathroom?

151
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,991
Next to my bedroom.

152
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,915
Down the hall.

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,951
So, what's Goldilocks's story?

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,991
- Never mind.
- Come on, Sam.

155
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,079
- Why can't you tell us?
- Yeah, what's the big deal?

156
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,988
Take it easy.
Sam's shy about these things.

157
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,430
- I'll fill you in. She's a hooker.
- She's not a hooker.

158
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,790
Well, not in the traditional sense.

159
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,638
She's not a hooker at all.

160
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,150
Finest young lady I ever met.
My head is killing me.

161
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,795
Look, she does not want
to be bothered.

162
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,558
She's waiting for her fiancé.

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,673
They're going to the Caribbean
to get married. OK?

164
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,518
They missed you.

165
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,439
Another beer, Norm?

166
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,677
Well, yeah, one more quick one.
Thanks.

167
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,314
- He's not back yet?
- No.

168
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,670
Why don't you make a run for it?

169
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,599
You're a bitter little person,
aren't you?

170
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,796
Yeah. Well, I have a right to be.

171
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,276
- My husband left me with four kids.
- Four kids?

172
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,915
Right. And after I paid his way
through school hustling drinks.

173
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,951
What school did your husband go to?

174
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,752
The Colletti Academy.

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,953
TV repair.

176
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,354
So the minute he graduated,
he left me.

177
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,315
Said I wouldn't fit in with the
other repairmen's wives. Big shot!

178
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,319
- He sounds like a cur.
- Yeah. Well, he's not all bad.

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,238
He still fixes my set
and only bills me for parts.

180
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,071
If it's my missus, I'm on my way.

181
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,953
Cheers. Yeah, just a sec.
Is there an Ernie Pantusso?

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,957
- That's you, Coach.
- Speaking.

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,755
I'd like two draughts
and a Scotch on the rocks.

184
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,429
That group's arguing
about the sweatiest movie ever made.

185
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,039
The what?

186
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,628
What movie
did people sweat most in?

187
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,318
That's easy. <i>Rocky II.</i>

188
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,796
No, not even close.
<i>Body Heat.</i> Sweat city.

189
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,639
<i>Ben Hur.</i> The boys
in that galley sweat like pigs.

190
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,672
<i>Alien.</i> Buckets.

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,516
The night before my wedding and
I'm in the middle of a sweat contest.

192
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,832
Speaking of sweat,
here's a little-known fact.

193
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,272
Women have fewer sweat glands than
men, but they're larger, more active.

194
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,793
- The human body.
- Consequently, they sweat more.

195
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,069
Really?

196
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,796
Sure. How about you, miss?
What are your perspiration patterns?

197
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,957
Sumner, I'm so glad to see you.

198
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,278
These men have been arguing
over the sweatiest movie ever made.

199
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,039
- <i>Cool Hand Luke.</i>
- That's one!

200
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,749
What happened to you?
It's been over an hour.

201
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,917
Diane, that woman is extraordinary.

202
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,313
- Did she give you the ring?
- I couldn't take it.

203
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,194
- We've got a plane to catch.
- Diane, I love you.

204
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,029
But when I was with Barbara,
something stirred inside me.

205
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,390
We can talk about it on the flight.

206
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,556
I can't fly to Barbados
this confused.

207
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,353
It's OK, the pilot knows the way.

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,279
I love your wit.

209
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,149
You're a beautiful child.

210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,357
- Let's go to Barbados.
- Let's go to Barbados.

211
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,079
- Who isn't here?
- Me.

212
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,279
Cheers. Just a minute.

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,719
If you're not, I apologise,
but is your name Sumner Sloane?

214
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,909
Yes, it is.

215
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,759
Hello?

216
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,750
No, it's alright.
She understands and I understand.

217
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,755
Barbara, that's very human of you.
I'll be right over.

218
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,278
And, Barbara,
your depth frightens me.

219
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,668
She insists that you have the ring.

220
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,030
We won't have time
to catch our flight.

221
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,472
You call and get us
on a later flight. I'll get the ring.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,479
- Sumner...
- Yes?

223
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,115
- How about a kiss?
- Maybe. I'll play it by ear.

224
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,873
Cheer up, cookie.
He may have been in an accident.

225
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,232
I'm knocking off, Sam.
Home to my book.

226
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,353
- Still working on that novel?
- Yeah, coming on six years now.

227
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,438
I got a feeling
I might finish it tonight.

228
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,439
- You're writing a novel?
- No, reading one.

229
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
Wait a second.
I want you to take Norm home.

230
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,873
- Norm!
- I'm up.

231
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,468
One quick one
then I really gotta fly.

232
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,514
- Coach will take you home.
- I'll give you a lift.

233
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,392
- Goodnight, Sam.
- Goodnight.

234
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,229
Coach, we stop somewhere,
I'll buy you a beer.

235
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,749
Norm, you're in here every night.

236
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,189
Doesn't your wife wonder
where you're at?

237
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,390
Wonders. Doesn't care.

238
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,512
Night, Sam.
Thanks for letting me bend your ear.

239
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,790
That's OK, Ron. Goodnight.

240
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,471
You must get real tired
of hearing people cry in their beer.

241
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,518
I wonder why people
tell bartenders their problems.

242
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,757
- It's kind of sad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,668
These poor wretches
with no one in the world to turn to

244
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,598
but some stranger who mixes drinks.

245
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,760
I met Sumner two years ago.

246
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,473
I was so flattered
when he went out of his way

247
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,239
to pick me as his teaching assistant.

248
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,680
I'm still kind of in awe of him,
you know.

249
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,949
He's the most brilliant man
I've ever known.

250
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,953
For the last two years, he's been
the most important thing in my life,

251
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,230
and now I may be losing him.

252
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,189
Come on.

253
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,915
Look, you are
a very attractive young lady.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,035
Thank you.

255
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,791
Yeah. Sure.

256
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,478
You're gonna find someone a lot
better than that goofy professor.

257
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,077
Goofy? Are you talking about Sumner?

258
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,998
- I'm talking about Sumner.
- You don't like Sumner.

259
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,997
I don't like Sumner.

260
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,271
- You know why you don't like Sumner?
- Because he's goofy.

261
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,230
No. Because
he's everything you're not.

262
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,593
He's well bred, highly educated,
he's distinguished, he's urbane...

263
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,633
- You left out "goofy".
- I did not leave out "goofy"!

264
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,672
- You were coming to it?
- I should have expected this.

265
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,156
That goof will be on the cover
of <i>Saturday Review</i> someday.

266
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,919
That goof is probably
gonna be on a beach tomorrow,

267
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,076
rubbing suntan oil on his ex-wife.

268
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,072
I've had a real rough day,

269
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,397
and I'm now going to reward myself
by getting out of here.

270
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,719
When Sumner comes back,
will you say I've gone home?

271
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,989
Fine.

272
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,312
I forgot to change
the reservations again.

273
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,591
- Use this one.
- Thank you.

274
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,190
I'd like to change the reservations
for Mr and Mrs Sumner Sloane,

275
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,276
flight 481 to Barbados.

276
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,595
They did? Are you sure?

277
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,273
No, thank you.

278
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,076
- I'm sorry.
- How did you know?

279
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,156
Bartenders' intuition.

280
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,596
A shame such an astute observer of
human nature is stuck behind a bar.

281
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,790
That's what I think.

282
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,276
Well, why not bring
your remarkable powers to bear

283
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,233
and enlighten me
as to what my future holds?

284
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,909
I'm probably gonna regret this,
but you could work here.

285
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,708
Sam.

286
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,158
Shut up for a second, will you?

287
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,510
I need...

288
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,315
I need two vodka gimlets,
one straight up, one blended, rocks,

289
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,238
Chivas rocks, soda,
a Comfort Manhattan, no cherry,

290
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,558
a white wine spritzer, an
Old Bushmill Irish decaf, no sugar.

291
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,196
What makes you think I would
ever work in a place like this?

292
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,232
Simple. You can't go back
to the professor for work.

293
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,310
I need a waitress. You need a job.

294
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,034
You like the people here.
You think they like you.

295
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,309
And the phrase "magnificent pagan
beast" has never left your mind.

296
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,673
Now, look, buster.

297
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,318
I do need a job. And I'll find one.

298
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,876
And you can bet
that it won't be waiting tables.

299
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,710
What are you qualified to do?

300
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,033
Nothing.

301
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,394
But somewhere, there is a job
that I'm perfect for,

302
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,078
that's perfect for me.

303
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,192
I'll find it.
And when I do, I'll know it.

304
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,712
Carla, what am I making?

305
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,235
Two vodka gimlets,
one straight up, one blended, rocks,

306
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,670
Chivas rocks, soda,
a Comfort Manhattan, no cherry,

307
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,314
a white wine spritzer with a twist,

308
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,513
one Old Bushmill lrish decaf,
hold the sugar.

309
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,159
<i>Your first customers.</i>

310
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,750
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

311
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,317
Hello. Welcome to Cheers.

312
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,309
My name is Diane. I will be serving
you. Why don't you sit down here?

313
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,590
I should tell you, parenthetically,

314
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,508
that you are the first people
that I have ever served.

315
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,235
If anyone had told me a week ago
that I would be doing this,

316
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,430
I would have thought them insane.

317
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,553
When Sam offered me the job,
I laughed in his face.

318
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,432
But then it occurred to me,...

319
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,029
...here I am, I'm a student.

320
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,278
Not just in an academic sense,
but a student of life.

321
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,598
And where better than here
to study life in all its many facets?

322
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,796
People meet in bars, they part,
they rejoice, they suffer.

323
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,915
They come here
to be with their own kind.

324
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,356
What can I get you?

325
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,150
Where is police?
We have lost our luggage.
