Isn't this in Chinatown?        

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,100
          I don't think so, Sam.

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,600
    Well, yeah,                 
    I think it is.

Did there seem to be a lot      
 of Chinese restaurants around? 

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,300
Yeah, I guess.

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,600
                  And, uh, a lot

of, uh, signs hanging hither    
and yon in Chinese there?       

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,800
Yeah, come to think of it.      

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,400
                  Yeah, lots of

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,700
Yeah, but that could just       

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,200
be a coincidence, you know?

Now I want delivery men to deal

         Is that clear?         

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
You certainly put me            
in my place.

                 I want you to  
                 notice that the

              have been shined. 

100
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm hardly concerned            
about doorknobs at the moment.

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,000
              You understood me?

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,100
    Yes. It was only            
    a matter of time.           

103
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,900
Well, doesn't anybody care      
            to know

what I <i>am</i> concerned about?

                        No.     

106
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,600
          Well, Fras,           
    you know normally,          

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
I wouldn't give a rat's tokus   

108
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
about anything                  
that happened to you,           

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,600
but the last guy                
I waited on threw up on my leg. 

110
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Now, this couldn't be           
any worse, right?               

111
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,200
        Shoot.                  

112
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,700
              It's my love life.

113
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,900
I'm gonna go find the guy       
that threw up on my leg.

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,600
      What's up, Frasier?       

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,900
Well, Sam, this morning,        

116
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,600
Lilith and I had                
the worst fight we've ever had. 

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
And I'm almost ashamed          
to admit it, but I...           

118
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,700
I even considered               
striking her.                   

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I mean, it wasn't completely    
without provocation.            

120
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100
She did throw a chair at me.    

121
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Just...                         

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
it's the same argument we've had
all the time lately. It...      

123

            another word about

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,900
                in a position

    when you were in charge,    
 but I take it very seriously.

  And as for you, Mrs. LeBec,   

252
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
        I would think...        

253

 that as another working woman  

254
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 that perhaps you would lend me 
         some support.          

255
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,100
Instead of always sniping       
        behind my back.         

256

What do you see we just wipe    
the slate clean here            

257
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,700
      and start a new era       
      of mutual support?        

258
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,200
                 Wonderful idea.

that I want my freedom,

     Gentlemen, gentlemen.      

276
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,500
    There's plenty of credit    
        for both of you.

    You two opened my eyes,

made me realize that there      
are other fish in the sea.      

279

So what did Lilith have to say  
when you flushed her?

tell her face-to-face,

    nervous as a schoolboy?

    Well, let me-let me come    
     directly to the point      

295

         by telling you         
 that you couldn't have chosen  

296
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,200
    a more opportune moment     
to declare your feelings.

Let me assure you,              
the feeling is mutual.

    There was a woman.          

366
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
                But I am a      
                man of honor.   

367
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,300
     I did not betray you.      

368
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,700
    Nothing happened.           

369
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,300
 You broke off our relationship 

370
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,800
      for the possibility       
      of a relationship?        

371
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,100
        A mere fantasy?         

372
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
        How flattering.         

373
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
        All right,              
    I'll be honest with you.    

374
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,200
     You see, I only wanted     
         to spare you.          

375
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,000
      This woman is a...        
      a sex-starved Circe       

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,700
                who drew my ship
                onto the rocks  

377
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
                    and there   
                    I foundered.

378
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,100
What's her name?                

379
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,800
     Well, let's just, you know,
     leave her name out of this.

380
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Frasier, are we going           
to clear the air                

381
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
or continue                     
to hold back?                   

382
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,600
Unless                          
you identify                    

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
this woman,                     
doubt and suspicion             

384
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,000
will fester                     
in my consciousness.            

385
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Every woman I meet              
will provoke the question,      

386
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,300
"Is this the one,               
is this the one,                

387
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,400
is this the one,                
is this the one                 
is this the one...?"            

388
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,500
              It's Rebecca Howe.

389
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,700
            She runs Cheers now.

390
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
So, now we know the slut's name.

391
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,800
    Please, Lilith...           

392
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,000
             don't you think you
             could forgive me?  

393
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know.                   

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
  At this moment, my feelings   
    for you are ambivalent.     

395
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
    I need to sort them out.    

396
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,700
I'm going to go out             

397
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,300
and wander the streets          
aimlessly.                      

398
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,900
I'll take my usual route.       

399
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,600
You know, I have                
an idea, Popsicle.              

400
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Uh, why don't I                 
run upstairs                    

401
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,900
and make us a nice warm,        
soothing bath, hmm?             

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
        Well, Mr. Bubble does   
        always cheer me so.     

403
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,700
  Once begun, it's half done.   

404
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,700
Are you sure                    
this is okay with Miss Howe?    

405
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,800
             Woody, she loves   
             this kind of stuff.

406
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,500
CARLA:                          
This is good,                   
wholesome humor.                

407
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,200
            In fact,            
  I bet she gives you a raise   

408
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
for doing such a good job.      

409
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,800
                 Oh, don't stop.

410
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,000
            I already saw it.   

411
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,600
    And I must admit,           
I haven't laughed so hard       

412
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,700
    since junior high.          

413
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
    I helped.                   

414
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,800
    Mr. Malone.                 

415
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
             Yeah?              

416
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,600
I want this nonsense            
with my picture to stop.        

417
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,600
I did you a favor               
by hiring you back,             

418
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,900
and this is not                 
a very nice way to repay me.    

419
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,000
                You're right.   

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,300
          You did do me a favor,

421
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
            and now I'm going   
            to do you one.      

422
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,900
I'm going                       
to give you a tip               

423
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,000
on how to deal with people      
who work for you.               

424
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Lighten up a little bit.        

425
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,000
I mean, you got to make         
some compromises.               

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
                I see.          

427
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
        You want me to hang     
        your picture back up.   

428
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,100
        Right.                  
                Done.           

429
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,000
        Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,   
        that was easy.          

430
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,400
                     Wait, uh...

431
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,200
             let's try some more
             compromises here.  

432
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,500
                 Um... I want to

433
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,800
                sleep with you  
                25 times, but...

434
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,800
     you don't want to sleep    
     with me at all, am I right?

435
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,900
    Right.                      

436
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,700
     Okay, so what's half of 25?

437
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,300
    Your I.Q.?                  

438
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,000
             Wait, uh... please.

439
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,700
      Um, I'm a little sensitive

440
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,100
         about people making    
         fun of my intelligence.

441
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,300
    I'm sorry.                  
            That's all right.   

442
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
But I wasn't making fun         
of your intelligence.           

443
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,800
                    Good.       

444
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
I was making fun                
of your lack of intelligence.   

445
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
              Cliffie, girl     
              fight, 12:00 high.

446
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,400
         Rebecca Howe?          

447
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
                Mm-hmm.         

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,100
You and I                       
are both mature women,          

449
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,400
and I think                     
we should handle this           

450
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,100
openly and with civility.       

451
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Believe me, I could be doing you
a very big favor.               

452
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,300
Frasier is not an easy man      
to live with.                   

453
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,700
He's obsessively compulsive     
about neatness.                 

454
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
The sex is good,                
but he pouts                    

455
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
unless you compliment           
his performance.                

456
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Fortunately,                    

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
his male ego                    
can be satisfied                

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
with a simple                   
"Thank you, Conan."             

459
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
    I don't know who you are,   

460
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,500
                and I don't know
                who Frasier is, 

461
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,400
              but I do... Conan?

462
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
You really don't know Frasier,  
do you?                         

463
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,900
                    No, I don't.

464
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
God, I'm such a fool.           

465
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,600
How could I let him             
do this to me?                  

466
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
                 It's all right.

467
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,500
        It happens to everybody.

468
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,800
He made up this whole story     

469
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
just to avoid                   
committing to me.               

470
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,700
And the worst part is           
he's going to get away with it. 

471
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,800
They always do.                 

472
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,300
      Yeah, men are such a pain.

473
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
            I have someone who's
            very special to me, 

474
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,300
    but he wouldn't notice me   
    if I set fire to my hair.   

475
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
        Him?                    

476
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,500
                ( <i>scoffing</i> )    

477
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
         No, definitely not him.

478
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
              I prefer the      
              Fortune 500 type--

479
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,100
            one who owns blocks,

480
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,200
                not one who     
                plays with them.

481
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,200
Look, they're flirting with me. 

482
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,900
            Well, I really do   
            have work to do.    

483
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,400
Perhaps we can have lunch       
together sometime.              

484
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,700
                  I'd like that.

485
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,200
    Lilith.                     
                Lilith.         

486
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,500
            Well, good night.   
    Good night.                 

487
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,900
          Mr. Malone,           
are you developing a tic?       

488
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,500
                That was a wink.

489
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,600
     Then you're developing     
          <i>into</i> a tick.          

490
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,800
        And stop looking        
        at my rear end.         

491
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,400
          Lucky guess.          

492
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,300
    Lilith.                     

493
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,000
Thank God                       
you're here.                    

494
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,100
You haven't confronted          
Rebecca yet, have you?          

495
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,500
                    Hardly.     
    Oh, good.                   

496
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,300
 How did you know where I was?  

497
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
     Well, when I realized      
you hadn't come upstairs,       

498
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,100
  I-I toweled off, and then...  

499
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,400
 ...suddenly, it dawned on me-- 

500
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
    that little firebrand's     
      gone down to Cheers       

501
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
     to fight for her man.      

502
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,100
See, I think                    
it best                         

503
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,800
     that I do this myself,     
        and, uh...              

504
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,700
      I think next week's       
      a really good time.       

505
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,000
              You did have an   
              affair with this  
              woman, didn't you?

506
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
That is what you told me.       

507
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
        Well, of course.        

508
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,100
    Well, then end it           
      right here and now.       

509
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
        I need to know          
        that it's over.         

510
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,600
                You've got to   
                cut this off    

511
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
        before she falls        
 more deeply in love with you.  

512
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,700
                And you've got  
                to let me watch.

513
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,300
 You know, I-I've got an idea.  

514
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,500
Let's go to Maine.

    Lilith, Lilith...           

517
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,800
the left-hand side of my body's 
     gone completely numb.      

518
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,400
You know what that means,       
        don't you?              

519
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,700
        Yes, you're stalling.

521
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,200
            It's down the       
            hall to the left.   

522
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,400
        Thank you.              

523
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,800
Ms. Howe,                       
let me introduce myself.        

524
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
      I'm Lilith Sternin.       

525
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
    You don't know me,          

526
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
but of course                   

527
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,200
this man needs no introduction. 

528
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,100
  He only needs a conscience.   

529
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,400
                         Frasier

530
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,300
         has something          
    he wants to say to you.     

531
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
Listen                          
very carefully                  

532
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
    and do what you must do.    

533
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,900
I'm... I'm sorry, Rebecca,      

534
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
    but it's-it's-it's time     
          it was over.          

535
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
I hope you can forgive me.      

536
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,700
     Now let's go to Maine.     

537
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Frasier, don't be               
so heartless.                   

538
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,500
 She deserves better than that. 

539
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
Uh, uh, no, no, please, please, 

540
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,900
        don't try               
  to articulate your feelings.  

541
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,600
Uh... just...                   

542
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,000
  let me say my little piece,   

543
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,400
     and then I'll be out       
     of your life forever.      

544
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,500
  Now, just remember the part   
  about not saying anything.    

545
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
                I know it sounds

546
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,200
      like a cliché to...       

547
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,700
        to say that this        
      is going to hurt me       

548
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,300
    more than it does you...    

549
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
     but it doesn't make it     
        any less true...        

550
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
    for you see, it is I...     
     who will be condemned      

551
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,900
never again to see your...      
         haunting eyes,         

552
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
your silken skin,               

553
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
     your shimmering hair.      

554
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,200
 But it-it's time that we part. 

555
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
    Farewell, sweet Rebecca.    

556
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,000
        How will I live         
without your passionate kisses? 

557
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,900
    You won't have to.          

558
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,300
Oh, Frasier...                  

559
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,200
Frasier,                        
for God's sakes,                

560
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
she was only joking.            

561
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,200
        Well, so was I.         

562
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,300
                Come on.        

563
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,600
I was just playing along.       

564
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,100
        I'm a dead man.         

565
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,400
Sweetheart? Buttercup?          

566
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,800
     You were just kidding,     
          weren't you?          

567
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,400

                     Please, uh,

571
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
             all I can say is...

572
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,000
            please have         
            mercy on me. I...

             Look, it's the     
             God's honest truth.

574
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
             Rebecca and I did  
             not have an affair.

575
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
                    I wanted to,

576
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
                  but she       
                  wasn't sure...

577
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,300
         A small point,         

578
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
    but she wasn't even sure    
        who I am, so...         

579
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,800
    I didn't really want to.    

580
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
     Uh, my body wanted to,     

581
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,500
            but my brain didn't.

582
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
            Well, part of my    
            brain did, but...   

583
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,500
 Well, that part's dead, and... 

584
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,000
        I guess...              
  what I'm trying to say is...  

585
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
    Will you marry me,
