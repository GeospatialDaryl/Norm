1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,710
- Evening, everybody.
- Norman.

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,673
- What's new, Norm?
- Most of my wife.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,710
You were going to Maine
for the holidays with Vera?

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,637
- Yeah, l am, Coach.
- What happened?

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,833
Nothing. Vera drove up last night.
l had to stay for an interview.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,112
l'm gonna drive up tonight.
She left me the directions here.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,153
- Should have no trouble finding it.
- Getting away, Norman?

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,193
Yeah. We got just the two of us.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,552
Big trees up there, you know.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,559
They got a frozen lake,
one radio station.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,839
lt sounds very romantic, Norman.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,679
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,831
Where can a guy go
for a good time around here?

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,953
Enjoy.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,871
No, wait, pal, l can't.
l can't do that to the navy.

16
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,439
lf you're in the mood for gum,
l can get you a fresh stick.

17
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,995
Actually, l was looking for bugs.

18
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,240
Try the blonde girl's hair.

19
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,153
- Say, you're from England?
- How'd you guess?

20
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,955
You sound smart
even when you say stupid things.

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,310
l hope you won't think
me presumptuous,

22
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,831
but dark, exotic women like you
bring a fever to my blood.

23
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,155
Wow! Classy!

24
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,113
My name is Carla. What can l get ya?

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,030
How do you do, Carla?

26
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,518
My name's Eric Finch.

27
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,072
Gin and bitters will do.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,558
You have an interesting profile.
Neapolitan, right?

29
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,989
My grandfather was from Naples.

30
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
We have a saying in my business,

31
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,075
''Giving your heart
to a Neapolitan girl

32
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,079
is like
forgetting to burn your code book.''

33
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,673
Blast. Now l've bloody well done it.

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,078
- You're not a spy?
- Please, don't say anything more.

35
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,998
You might jeopardise my life
You see that man?

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,870
Yeah.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,471
He might be the secret agent from
a foreign country's intelligence.

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,670
l'd hate to live there.

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,593
Alright, here's a little-known fact.
The smartest animal is the pig.

40
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,713
- What? They look pretty stupid.
- Yeah, your average oinker.

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,912
Scientists say if a pig
had thumbs and a language,

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,076
he could be trained to do
manual labour.

43
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,679
Be part of the workforce?

44
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,674
Yeah.
They'd give 30 years loyal service,

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,588
then at the retirement dinner,
you could eat 'em.

46
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,156
- Alright.
- The smartest animal's a pigeon.

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,956
A thousand cars on the turnpike,
they find mine.

48
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,152
No, l have to give my vote
to the ants.

49
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,794
- How do you figure that?
- See those farms they build?

50
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,798
They build those without plans.

51
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,957
To ants. For all you do,
this one's for you.

52
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,074
Coach, who do you say
is the smartest animal?

53
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,272
l gotta say <i>Francis the Talking Mule.</i>

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,233
No, you're not catching on here.
That was a real guy talking.

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,399
lt wasn't that he could talk,
it was what he said, right?

56
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,230
Yeah, it was a lot better than
that drivel <i>Mister Ed</i> was giving us.

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,558
- Good point.
- Sam, a gin and bitters.

58
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,797
Hey, everybody, come here.
Don't look suddenly,

59
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,037
but there's a guy over there
who's a secret agent.

60
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,550
- That's ridiculous.
- Thanks for being so cool.

61
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,792
- You mean like a spy?
- You mean like James Bond?

62
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,115
Norm, Jack, it's stakeout time.

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,233
- What makes you think that?
- He kinda opened up to me.

64
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,229
l was sitting talking to him
and... he said he thinks l'm sexy.

65
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,874
They're trained to lie.

66
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,839
You know, Diane,

67
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,593
he just got back from Ankara. He says
l'm cuter than any Bulgarian girl.

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,599
Well, l'm not surprised,
Ankara is in Turkey.

69
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,188
Great. l really wanted to know that.

70
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,074
Another fascinating fact
from the answer geek.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,152
- What's the matter with her?
- You're always correcting people.

72
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,589
- No, l'm not.
- l stand corrected.

73
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,553
- That doesn't count.
- l'm wrong again.

74
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,275
All l said was he doesn't sound like
he knows what he's talking about.

75
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,836
Who'd make the mistake
of thinking Ankara's in Bulgaria?

76
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,791
Well, Francis wouldn't.

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,119
lf you're a spy, why have you
got your back to the door?

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,189
Because l can see the door
reflected in your beautiful eyes.

79
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,276
That old line.

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,157
Your eyes remind me of an etching
l bought in Norway for 200 guilders.

81
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,477
- Norway's currency is the Krone.
- Diane.

82
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,910
lf you have a licence to kill,
can l use it a second?

83
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,632
- She's right.
- She is?

84
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,675
Of course. That how we broke down
Norway's economic system

85
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,509
by infiltrating the government
with foreign currency.

86
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,949
- ls that right?
- Diane.

87
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,833
That way we undermined
the people's confidence

88
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,633
and their totalitarian regime.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,798
Norway
doesn't have a totalitarian regime.

90
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,591
Hey! Get it over here!

91
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,830
<i>Pardonnez</i>-<i>moi.</i>
l believe my employer craves a word.

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,275
- You bellowed?
- Yeah. What are you trying to do?

93
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,552
l don't believe that guy's a spy
for one minute. He's lying.

94
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,754
What? A customer in a bar is telling
tall tales to impress a waitress?

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,518
Call <i>60 Minutes.</i>

96
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,149
Alright,... when you put it that way.
The thing is....

97
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,989
Look, why do you suppose
people come to bars?

98
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,112
Let me take a wild stab at that.
Perchance to drink?

99
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,791
Wrong. They come here to shoot off
their mouths and get away with it.

100
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,152
ln this bar everybody
gets to be a hero. What's the harm?

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,069
Sam, any kind of lie
is eventually destructive.

102
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,352
l was raised and educated
to prize truth above all else.

103
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,156
This from a woman wearing
rubber eyelashes and a padded bra.

104
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,677
- That's a lie.
- l'm gonna need some proof.

105
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,476
Look, all l'm saying is,

106
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,559
if this guy wants to be a spy,
humour him, indulge him.

107
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,797
- Sam.
- Come on. What's the big deal?

108
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,388
- OK, he's a spy.
- There you go.

109
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,758
Excuse me.

110
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,397
Carla here,
she inadvertently blew your cover.

111
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,317
Oh, boy!

112
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,273
So, l understand
you're in the spy game?

113
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,590
Yes, sir, what's it like to be a spy?

114
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,508
We swear not a word you say
will ever go beyond this room.

115
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,835
We never go beyond this room.

116
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,671
Can l... really trust you chaps?

117
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,270
- Yeah, sure. Everybody swear.
- We swear.

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,516
- Cross my heart.
- Alright.

119
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,631
What you've got to understand,

120
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,036
is that we're not all like how
we're portrayed in the cinema.

121
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,310
We don't think we're heroes,

122
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,833
we're just doing a job, putting
our lives on the line for democracy.

123
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,429
Tell us about
your most hair-raising mission.

124
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,109
You ever get betrayed in the sack
by a Russian babe?

125
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,034
Let me tell you
about Russian women.

126
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,596
The cold weather
makes them very passionate.

127
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,989
Lake Winnemucca, here l come.

128
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,469
You asked me about
my most exciting adventure.

129
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,754
l think of... Romania, 1 973.

130
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,958
Yes.
l was captured by the dreaded RPB.

131
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,118
The Ripba.

132
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,353
They're every bit as fiendish
as you've heard.

133
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,598
They even used the infamous twister
on me. The devils.

134
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,554
- What's the twister?
- lt's a ride at Coney lsland.

135
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,548
Those animals.

136
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,119
- Diane, why don't you just shut up?
- Carla, he's been lying to you.

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,719
- OK?
- No, he hasn't.

138
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,277
You are not a history expert,
you majored in poetry.

139
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,755
Tell her you haven't been lying,
Eric.

140
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,269
Tell her you haven't been lying,
Eric.

141
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,193
She's absolutely right.

142
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,519
You've been lying the whole time?

143
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,238
The whole time.

144
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,554
Let me get this straight.

145
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,989
Cold weather
does not make women passionate?

146
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,151
l'll see Vera in the spring.

147
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,192
Why did you lie to us?

148
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,638
Because my life

149
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,438
is very unexciting
and it's very dull.

150
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,312
l've been a failure
at everything l've tried to do.

151
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,072
But, you know, sometimes
late at night in a friendly bar,...

152
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,320
..l sometimes can make someone
believe that l'm interesting.

153
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,435
But you're much too smart for me.

154
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,678
You don't need any... illusions.

155
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,957
Good night, miss.

156
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,114
Before you say anything,

157
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,438
l want you to know that l could not
feel any worse than l do right now.

158
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,118
l'm so sorry.

159
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,195
l... forgot the tip.

160
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,233
Merry Christmas.

161
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,997
Wrong again.

162
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,831
l failed. l blew it.

163
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,999
l quit. l don't belong here.
There's no point arguing about it.

164
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,678
Who's arguing?

165
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,315
l am opinionated, l am stubborn,
l am smug....

166
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,955
A little louder,
they can't hear you in the back.

167
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,476
l'm a total washout as a cocktail
waitress. l don't belong here.

168
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,830
- Stay in touch, kid.
- Carla.

169
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,838
Diane, please, listen.

170
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,554
l don't know exactly
what's going on here,

171
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,877
but it looks like
you booted a grounder, right?

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,955
Right.

173
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,470
You know what l'd tell a player
when he made a mental error?

174
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,749
What?

175
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,314
Nothing. That's why l got fired.

176
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,832
Wait. Come back here.

177
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,997
Look, you made a mistake, that's all.

178
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,032
Go find the poor guy
bring him back and apologise.

179
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,353
A wonderful idea,
but where would l look?

180
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,553
l think your British Embassy
could probably help you there.

181
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,038
l've got a good ear for dialects.
My instincts tell me, limey.

182
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,196
His name is Eric Finch.

183
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,832
Alright, l'll do it.

184
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,998
l am going to comb this city.

185
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,590
l'll look everywhere,
every hotel, restaurant, cheap dive.

186
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,190
l'll find this man or die trying.
Excuse me.

187
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,753
Look who's back!

188
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,237
l just came back to try and explain
why l did what l did.

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,430
No.

190
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,595
Mr Finch, everybody in the bar
exaggerates a little.

191
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,190
Sure. For example,
l'm not really this good-looking.

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,278
Everybody in bars tells stories.
You just got a little carried away.

193
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,276
Right.

194
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,997
l'm afraid l'm the victim
of an overactive imagination.

195
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,276
When you spend 1 2 hours a day
in a room alone writing,

196
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,517
sometimes
you just lose touch with reality.

197
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,155
So l'm awfully sorry and l beg
your pardon and good night.

198
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,840
No. You write?

199
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,117
Yes. Mostly verse. Farewell.

200
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,993
Wait. You write poetry?

201
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,395
l'd love to hear some.

202
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,158
We all would.

203
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,318
- Yes.
- Yeah.

204
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,628
lt's not often we have a guy
in here who can write poetry.

205
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,275
A guy in the men's room, Sam,
writes some terrific stuff.

206
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,395
- Gin and bitters?
- Yes. Thank you.

207
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,638
- Are you published?
- No. l don't even send my stuff in.

208
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,433
- l'm not very good.
- Don't be silly.

209
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,199
Let me be the judge.
l majored in poetry.

210
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,835
- l thought it was philosophy.
- No, it was psychology,

211
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,794
but that was before Literature
and after French.

212
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,480
No, that was after Art History.

213
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,798
- And before Anthropology.
- We're forgetting lndian Studies.

214
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,436
- And Manchurian Folk Dancing.
- Alright.

215
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,035
At any rate, l would love
to see some of your work.

216
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,429
l've don't have anything with me.
lt's all in here... and here.

217
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,959
- l must hear one.
- Really?

218
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,035
Yes.

219
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,311
Alright. l'll try something.
How did it go?

220
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,316
''She l love, alas in vain,
Floats before my slumbering eyes;

221
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,352
And when she comes,
she lulls my pain;

222
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,792
And when she goes,
what pangs arise.''

223
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,751
- My God, that's lovely.
- l liked it. What do you think?

224
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,316
lt'll look great up on the tiles.

225
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,548
Mr Finch, l am awestruck.

226
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,912
- Me, too. Great.
- Please, tell us more.

227
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,919
Maybe not so soon. Give us a chance
to rub down the goose bumps.

228
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,951
This is a night l will never forget.

229
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,152
lt so happens
that l am on speaking terms

230
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,238
with a poetry editor
at <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

231
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,070
He spoke at my college once.
l'll call him and tell him about you.

232
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,194
Wait. Aren't you
getting a little carried away here?

233
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,278
May l have the phone?
Yes, and loving it.

234
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,238
Humouring him's one thing. He can
have all the fantasies he wants here.

235
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,920
But you're going too far
to make him feel good.

236
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,036
Sam, the poem he wrote is excellent.
Scratch a liar, find a poet.

237
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,235
- He memorised one. What's it prove?
- We are now in my area of expertise.

238
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,591
When we want to talk about poetry,
we come to me.

239
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,156
When we want to talk about jock itch,
we come to you.

240
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,474
Yes. May l speak to him?
This is Diane Chambers.

241
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,354
He's chatting with John Updike?

242
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,392
Well, interrupt. No, l'm not kidding.

243
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,991
l have something that makes Updike
seem like small <i>pommes de terre.</i>

244
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,192
- Diane, l wouldn't do this.
- Yes, l'll wait.

245
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,151
Would you leave me alone.

246
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,193
Mr Finch, he really should hear this
directly from you. Come over, please.

247
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,877
What is your best work?

248
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,675
There's a little something
l dashed off this morning.

249
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,952
Wonderful.
Hello, my name is Diane Chambers.

250
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,789
Yes, l know you're busy, but l have
a wonderful surprise for you.

251
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,797
Just listen for a moment.

252
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,559
Verse alert, Cliffy,
strap yourself in, pal.

253
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,033
Dive.

254
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,676
Excuse me, we are about
to make literary history here.

255
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,198
Hello.

256
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,837
''My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in the watered shoot;''

257
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,757
Now, that's a poet.

258
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,952
Thank you.
''My heart is like an apple tree

259
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,038
Whose bough is bent
with thick-set fruit;

260
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,712
''My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles on a halcyon sea;

261
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,438
''My heart is gladder
than all these things

262
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,596
Because my love has come to me.''

263
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,636
The nuns taught us it in school.
l get tears just remembering.

264
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,193
No fooling. Tears?

265
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,198
Yeah.
They whacked us with their beads.

266
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,796
Yes, Rossetti, you're right.
Thank you for settling that bet.

267
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,549
Wonderful. To whom could l speak
about a subscription. l...?

268
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,717
l don't believe this guy.

269
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,594
You cannot believe a word
that comes out of his mouth.

270
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,156
lf you could fix TVs
and crack walnuts on your forehead,

271
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,555
you could be my ex-husband.

272
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,830
Mr Finch, whatever,
l don't know what your real story is,

273
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,475
and the last thing l want
is for you to tell me,

274
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,353
but l wanna thank you
for entertaining us.

275
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,075
- l'm really glad you came.
- Thank you, Sam.

276
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,512
- My real name's Thomas Hilliard lll.
- Well, whatever.

277
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,916
You have a very charming saloon here.

278
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,758
Thank you. l'm glad you like it.

279
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,158
To show you how much,
l'd like to buy it.

280
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,397
How much is it worth to you?

281
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,830
He's not gonna give up.
Wait, let me guess.

282
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,032
You are an eccentric millionaire
who hangs around bars

283
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,119
and tells stories about himself
to have fun with people, right?

284
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,232
Kinda like Howard Hughes,
Mr Hilliard?

285
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,670
Don't mention that name.
He died owing me money.

286
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,073
- Well, Sam, how much?
- Well, gee, this is kinda sudden.

287
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,079
Let's see, l guess, 20, 30 people
come here every night.

288
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,592
- $1 million seems fair to me.
- You've got it.

289
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,271
- Sam, you're forgetting the jukebox.
- He's right. Sorry. $2 million.

290
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,356
l think you're taking advantage
of me, Sam.

291
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,350
Hey, look at me everybody. Scratch
a bartender, find a millionaire.

292
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,711
This is not funny any more.
l was right about him.

293
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,957
He's a sick man
with a very warped sense of humour.

294
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,073
He doesn't care who he hurts.
He's a pathological liar.

295
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,718
Excuse me, Mr Hilliard.

296
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,593
Oh, my... God!

297
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,837
l just wanted to let you know
l'm here with the car.

298
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,190
Thank you, Robert. l'm ready.

299
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,868
l'm sorry
we couldn't do business, Sam.

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,152
Million and a half and l'll throw in
a blonde waitress.

301
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,919
Those papers
have arrived from Geneva.

302
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,429
l'll sign them on the plane.

303
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,350
Sam, will you ever be able
to forgive me?

304
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,995
- Come on, l'd never sell this place.
- l got the date.

305
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,871
l've never felt so abused.
l was wrong every step of the way.

306
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,391
l thought he was lying when he was
telling the truth and vice versa.

307
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,829
From now on, l will not believe
anything anybody says.

308
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,952
- You don't mean that. You serious?
- You bet l am.

309
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,953
You know,
l think l'm falling in love with you.

310
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,798
Really?

311
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,435
