1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,716
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,831
You sure you don't wanna
have another round?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,355
Not me, pal. Let's get out of here.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,238
What's the damage, Mac?

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,913
Oh, just let me figure it up here.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,750
That'll be 27.50.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,239
Ouch. You sure?

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,196
Yep, you two gentlemen
had four peach daiquiris

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,396
and three crème de menthe frappés.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,358
Something funny, dipstick?

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,069
In the paper this morning, yeah,
it seems that, oh,

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,800
the Sarge got tricked
by Beetle Bailey again.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,633
See, Beetle put some itching powder
in his shorts.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,031
Oh, we thought that maybe
you was laughing at our drink order.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,317
Oh, on the contrary.
No, no, no--

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,631
Woody, let me have another mocha
froth, will you? And keep them coming.

17
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,472
Hey, guess who's gonna interview me
on the radio tonight?

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,671
Someone with a taste for adventure.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,353
- Dave Richards, my old buddy.
- Hey.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,114
And a 2-by-4 for a brain.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,271
I need Dewar's rocks, please.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,833
What's your big problem with Dave?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,592
I mean, ever since he came in
this place,

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,079
you've been badmouthing the guy.

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,277
For some strange reason,
I find it hard to respect a man

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,353
with the bumper sticker
"Honk if you're horny."

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,828
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah. Honk, honk, honk!

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,350
Oh, there's news.

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,989
Hey, Sam, what time do you have
to be at the radio station?

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,879
No, it's a phone interview.
You know, it's that sports talk show

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,712
that Dave does after
the Red Sox games.

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,633
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,998
- What do you say, Norm?
- Well, I never met a beer I didn't drink.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,917
And down it goes, huh?

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,151
- We missed you last night, buddy.
- You did?

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,197
- Yeah.
- Well, Vera and I went out dancing

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,237
with the Henshaws.
The next-door neighbours.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,038
- Oh, what, again?
- Normie, dancing?

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,270
- Yeah.
- I didn't think you liked walking.

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,477
You kidding? I love dancing.
I could watch for hours.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,392
You don't dance yourself?

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,308
Vera's the dancer in our family.
She even has dancer's buns, Sammy.

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,114
Too bad they're on her calves, though.
You know, it's kind of...

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,670
So, Normie, who was the--?
Who was Vera dancing with then?

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,038
- The guy, Ron Henshaw.
- Oh, yeah?

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,633
- Yeah. Good dancer.
- Oh, is he?

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,268
Well, they dance
the slow dances, do they?

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,954
Yeah, a few times.
Why do you ask, Cliff?

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,078
Oh, no reason, no reason.
But you know, during the slow dances,

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,800
certain parts of the body
rub up against one another.

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,600
You know, thigh touches thigh,
purely by accident.

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,115
Before you know it,
you're hosing them off like dogs.

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,832
It's good clean fun, all right, Cliffy?

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,991
Yeah, well, I know which way
the wind blows.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,754
Yeah, usually out of your mouth.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,112
Cheers.

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,799
Oh, yeah, he's right here.

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,552
Sam, it's some guy
from the radio station.

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,073
Dave's ready to go on the air!

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,430
All right, all right, I'll be in my office.
Pipe down.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,439
I can't believe I'm talking
to a real radio station.

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,153
Hey, hey, listen, while I've got you,
could you please play "Roxanne"

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,197
and dedicate it to my girl?

64
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,430
No, no, her name's Beth.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,397
But I don't think there's
a song called "Beth."

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,996
Oh, hi, Sam. Oh, right,
I'll hang up. Goodbye.

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,958
Well, it's not really goodbye
because we're not actually--

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,078
Right now? Yes, okay.
They're ready.

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,878
- What's the score?
- What's the line?

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,393
- Who's ahead?
- Who's behind?

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,916
Hey, let's ask Dave!

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,913
Who's behind? Come on,
can we say that on the air?

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,319
Yes, it's me, Dave Richards,
with Sports Shorts.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,436
Well, we don't have much time
because the Red Sox

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,478
were involved in another
long, boring extra-inning game.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,631
So let's get right to tonight's guest.

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,313
He's former Red Sox relief pitcher

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,790
and one of my buds, Sam Malone.
How you doing?

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,356
Sure am, Dave. How are you?

80
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,988
- Just great. And you?
- Couldn't be better.

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,071
That's great to hear.
Boy, we've had some fun...

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,231
Where does one send
for a transcript?

83
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,795
Well, I think we've hogged
the airwaves long enough, Sam.

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,952
So let's open up those phone lines
for you listeners out there.

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,839
Got a question you've been dying
to ask Sam Malone?

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,592
Well, here's your chance.

87
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,913
Former major league great
Mayday Malone.

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,433
All the lines are clear,
and it is a toll-free call.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,595
It doesn't have to be about baseball.
Anything at all. Anything.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,557
Hey, we've got a call.
You're on the Shorts.

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,790
Hey, Sam, where'd
you put the olives?

92
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,633
Woody-- Woody, get off the--

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,153
Get off the phone!

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,076
- He said, "Anything at all."
- Here's another one.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,798
- Go ahead.
- Sam, you were known as

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,712
quite a ladies' man
during your playing days.

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,394
Are women more impressed
by a man in a baseball uniform?

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,630
Well, actually I found women
were a lot more impressed

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,553
when I was out of my uniform,
if you get my drift.

100
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,073
Hey.

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,516
No, seriously, you know,
a lot of the chicks I dated

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,477
know nothing about
the game of baseball at all.

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,996
You know, in fact, one former
love bunny actually brought a book

104
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,469
to a Red Sox game to pass time
between pitches.

105
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,076
- "Love bunny"?
- A book? You mean, like, to read?

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,276
I swear to God, Dave.

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,548
Gee, I wonder who
that was, Diane.

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,393
--his grandchildren about that.
Anyway, this is Dave Richards

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,915
saying, "Be a sport.
Don't be a jerk. " Goodbye.

110
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,957
Great show.

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,793
Hey, do you love me, public?

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,511
Love bunny?

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,238
What's wrong with that?

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,392
How dare you callously
and cruelly lump me in

115
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,154
with the other conglomeration
of Twinkies

116
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,359
that constitutes your sexual past.

117
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,192
There's just no pleasing that woman.

118
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,874
- Hello, Norm.
- Oh, Phyllis.

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,349
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I took the chance

120
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
- I might find you here.
- Whoa, what are the odds?

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,716
You guys, this is Phyllis Henshaw.

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,314
- Hi.
- So where's Ron?

123
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,913
I don't know.

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,714
Could we talk privately?

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,393
Sure, yeah. Just follow me here.

126
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,755
- Can I get you anything?
- No. No, thank you.

127
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,480
What's up?

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,593
Norm, I've been trying to think
of an easy way to say this,

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,990
but I can't.

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,595
I think Vera and Ron
are having an affair.

131
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,719
Vera and Ron?

132
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,028
Did you guys all get that back there?

133
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,479
That's just great. How about you guys?
Did you get that, everyone?

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,279
Come on, let's just get away
from the peanut gallery here.

135
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,272
This is kind of hard to believe, Phyllis.

136
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,998
I mean, what makes you
think they are?

137
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,839
- Oh, Norm, come on. You're not blind.
- What? What?

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,072
Haven't you seen the way they look
at each other when they're dancing?

139
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,674
And I don't have to tell you
how attractive Vera is.

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,354
No, you certainly don't.

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,834
And Ron's always going over
to "borrow" things from you.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,310
Yeah, but-- Well, all right, yeah.

143
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,438
Now, Vera said that he came over
yesterday to borrow a power drill,

144
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,071
- but I really...
- Norm, we have a power drill.

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,955
Variable speed?

146
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,918
Yes.

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,150
- Cordless?
- Oh, my God!

148
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,276
Phyllis, this doesn't necessarily mean
anything.

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,318
Well, we have to find out. I think we
ought to hire a private detective.

150
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,755
No, I think you're jumping
the gun a little bit.

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,273
- Oh, are we?
- Yes. Yeah, I do.

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,034
Well, Ron told me he'd be home
all night. Let's just see if he is.

153
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,272
Phyllis, I'm sure-- Look-- Get--

154
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,396
So, what's up, buddy?

155
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,312
It's probably nothing, I hope.

156
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,630
Oh, come on, Norm.
Fill us in, will you?

157
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,472
I mean, we're--
We're your friends here.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,916
We're sensitive and caring,
and our only concern is your support.

159
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,354
You know that, Norman.

160
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,670
Well, all right, how much did you
overhear so far?

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,308
Well, everything but the location

162
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,914
where they're satisfying
their pagan lust.

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,237
No, this just can't be true, Mr Peterson.
They wouldn't do that.

164
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,709
I mean, they're both married,
for Pete's sake.

165
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,110
How old are you?

166
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,310
Well, what--? What happened?

167
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,833
Ron's not home.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,310
- Hire a private dick, Norm.
- Hey, my cousin Santo's a gumshoe,

169
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,799
- and a great one.
- Great, great.

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,190
He's professional, thorough
and a master of disguise.

171
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,157
- I'm sure he is.
- Not just as people either,

172
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,074
but things. Furniture.
I mean, he could be here right now.

173
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,028
Norman, I think it's a mistake.
Don't give in to suspicion.

174
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,475
Baloney! Hire Santo.
Better safe than sorry.

175
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,435
- No, Norm...
- Norman, trust-- Trust--

176
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,157
Who are these people?

177
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,232
All right. Wait a minute. Just--
Would you wait a minute, now?

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,474
Phyllis, you may not know about Ron,
but Vera happens to love me, all right?

179
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,473
And I certainly love her.
I'm gonna call her right this minute.

180
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,198
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna tell her that.

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,318
- Yeah.
- She better be there to hear it.

182
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,153
She will.

183
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,311
Oh, hi, honey.

184
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,515
No, nothing, nothing, I just, actually,
called to tell you that I love you.

185
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,674
The usual time.
All right, fine. Yeah, bye. Bye.

186
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,556
She said she's just sitting
home alone listening to records.

187
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,029
Oh, I could hear Johnny Mathis
singing in the background.

188
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,838
There you go. I knew it.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,230
Now, that's good news,
isn't it, Mr Peterson?

190
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,879
Yeah.

191
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,397
It'd even be better if we had
a Johnny Mathis album.

192
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,436
We have one.

193
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,319
All right, Carla, call your cousin.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,758
Hey. Did you enjoy your dinner?

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,794
Hey. Hey, listen.

196
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,432
Excuse me, miss?

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,150
Are you or are you not
speaking to me?

198
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,595
Never ever again.

199
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,751
How could you?

200
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,236
After all we've been through.

201
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,556
What we had together
was real and special,

202
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,678
and now you've cheapened it
for all eternity

203
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,116
by broadcasting to the entire
Boston metropolitan area

204
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,752
that I was nothing but
an odalisque in your seraglio.

205
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,837
If that's your idea of the silent
treatment, it needs a little work.

206
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,999
Oh, come on...
All right, all right,

207
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,512
whatever it is I said, and whatever
the hell it was that you just said,

208
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,229
what if--? What if I go back
on the air there and apologize?

209
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,311
Will that fix things up?

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,356
Do whatever you want.
I couldn't care less.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,479
Keep it short and simple.

212
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,039
Something dignified.

213
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,840
No sweat.

214
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,595
I'll write the script for you.

215
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,591
Well, is there anything else
you can tell me?

216
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,558
No. No, I think that's just
about everything.

217
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,994
When can you start?

218
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,118
Look, you both seem like nice people,
huh? Do yourselves a favour.

219
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,271
Don't hire me.

220
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,229
Well, that's an interesting sales pitch
you have there,

221
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,755
- but we're quite serious about this.
- And you don't know

222
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,275
what you're letting yourselves
in for here. A lot of pain,

223
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,078
a lot of heartache, a lot of misery.

224
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,356
And that's just when you see the bill.

225
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,988
My cousin, she's a pistol.

226
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,948
Mr Carbone, by hiring you, we hope
to prove our spouses innocent.

227
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,190
- Yeah, there you go.
- Well, in most of these cases

228
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,432
the news is otherwise.
Believe me, I've seen it a million times.

229
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,309
A bored husband, fed up with leftovers
in the bedroom as well as the kitchen,

230
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,552
starts eyeing the cute little pastry tart
next door who's only too happy

231
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,756
to serve up a little dessert.

232
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,954
That's not true in our case,
is it, Norm?

233
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,951
No. No way. Anyone else hungry?

234
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,070
Look, nothing like this
has ever happened before.

235
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,629
Up until now, we've both
had happy marriages.

236
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,112
Please, believe me,
people who don't know are better off.

237
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,072
- Could you excuse us for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

238
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,272
Well, Norm, what do you think?

239
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm not so sure we should
hire this guy.

240
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,434
Well, if we're being made fools of,
I'd prefer to know it.

241
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,672
Can't we just assume it
and save a little money here?

242
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,876
All right, look, Mr Carbone,

243
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,758
we're gonna hire your services,
all right?

244
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,194
Your funeral.

245
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,749
- Thanks for the referral, Carla.
- Yeah, see you, Santo.

246
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,273
Yeah.

247
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,549
- You're Diane Chambers, aren't you?
- Yes, I am. You look familiar.

248
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,917
Weren't you an attendant
at Goldenbrook?

249
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,354
That was just my cover.

250
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,475
Santo was the one who I hired to track
you down at the insane asylum.

251
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,159
It wasn't an insane asylum, damn it!

252
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,279
It was more like a spa.

253
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,635
You're out already, huh?

254
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,713
Of course I'm out.

255
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,599
- Why wouldn't I be out?
- No reason.

256
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,513
Look, you take it easy.

257
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,877
Okay, Sam Malone is back on
the show with a prepared statement

258
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,270
that he's gonna read.
Go ahead, Sammy.

259
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,878
Ladies and gentlemen, a week
ago on this program, l, Sam Malone,

260
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,319
committed a faux pas
of the highest magnitude.

261
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,314
I insensitively included
a wonderful woman in a category

262
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,792
in which she certainly
did not merit inclusion.

263
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,875
I apologize to her and indeed
to women everywhere,

264
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,393
both living and dead,

265
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,590
whose sensibilities
may have been offended.

266
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,751
Yeah, yeah, well, whatever
peels your potatoes, Sam.

267
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,717
Our next guest is a guy that played--

268
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,838
- Very well done. Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah?

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,072
You're welcome, little love bunny.

270
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,949
Oy vey.

271
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,554
You all right, Mr Peterson?
You've been awful quiet tonight.

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,351
I was thinking about a high school
football game, actually.

273
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,310
That was a long time ago, Woody.
And far away from here.

274
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,552
We were playing our archrivals
for the state championship, you know?

275
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,191
And I saw the cutest little cheerleader
that I've ever seen in my life

276
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,396
just cheering her heart out.

277
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,879
Yeah. I looked at her,
and the sun seemed to be shining

278
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,634
only where she stood.
You know what I mean?

279
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,068
And she seemed to be everything
that was bright and pure and good.

280
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,231
I knew right then and there that l
wanted to make that little gal my wife.

281
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,396
So I turned to Vera, and I said,

282
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,438
"Honey, would you mind introducing
me to that cheerleader?"

283
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,072
I'm joking, Woody.

284
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,437
Of course that little cheerleader
was Vera.

285
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,989
Hey, can I ask you a question,
Mr Peterson?

286
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,515
- Sure, Woody.
- Who won the game?

287
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,795
You know, I really couldn't tell you
who won, Woody,

288
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,918
but tonight I sure know who lost.

289
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,318
Well, can't you figure
it out from that?

290
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,073
- Could I have another beer, please?
- Yeah. Coming up.

291
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,508
Norm. Hi, I just got a call
from Mr Carbone.

292
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,955
He's gonna drop by with his report
in a few minutes.

293
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,190
- Did he say anything?
- No, he said he wanted to wait

294
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,349
and talk to us in person.

295
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,669
Oh, man.

296
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,630
Could we wait in the backroom,
where it's private?

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,995
All right. Sure.

298
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,395
- Oh, Norm, where did we go wrong?
- I don't know.

299
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,994
I've been racking my brain
trying to figure it out.

300
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,113
I mean, day after day, night after night,
I sit on that stool out there

301
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,113
wondering, "Why did she
lose interest in me?"

302
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,270
Norm, listen.

303
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,749
Whatever the outcome,
I want you to know

304
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,150
I couldn't have gotten through this
without you.

305
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,719
You've been a tower of strength.

306
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,074
You've been great too, Phyllis.
Thank you.

307
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,070
What if the news is bad?
I mean, what then?

308
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,511
- Well, I know what I'm gonna do.
- Oh, yeah?

309
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,275
I'm gonna go right out and have
an affair myself. Maybe lots of them.

310
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,070
You are darn right.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

311
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,630
Just watch my dust.

312
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,150
Of course,

313
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,438
the difficult part
is finding the right person.

314
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,956
It's hard, all right.

315
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,192
Now, that's always the hard part.

316
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,828
You know, it would have to be
someone who really understands me.

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,911
You know what I mean?

318
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,753
Someone you could depend on?

319
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,798
But who? I wouldn't know
where to begin.

320
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,554
I'd be completely lost.

321
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,792
Of course, I wouldn't wanna
break up a marriage

322
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,953
like those two home wreckers.

323
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,236
Those jackals.

324
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,830
Adulterers.

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,230
Fornicators.

326
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,428
All right-- Oh, for God's sakes!

327
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,269
Boy, this is one for the books.
God help us all.

328
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,510
All right.
Just-- No commentary, please.

329
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,318
Skip it and just give us
the report here.

330
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,278
All right, all right. I followed them
everywhere. From the supermarket

331
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,749
to the movie theatre to the golf course.

332
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,708
Last night I got what I wanted
at the Sea Shanty restaurant.

333
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,950
- Well, let's hear the tape.
- Yeah, let's.

334
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,032
I don't wanna hang around
here any longer than I gotta.

335
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
- We've put this off too long.
- Well, we wanted to be sure

336
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,316
- about some things.
- Right, l--

337
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,117
- Busboy dropped a tray.
- What did she say?

338
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,157
- I couldn't hear a thing.
- What did you say?

339
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,677
I said I can't go through with it.
I just can't hurt Norm.

340
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,953
I feel exactly the same way.
I can't hurt Norm either.

341
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,075
- Well, I guess that's that.
- Yeah, I just realized

342
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,515
in a strange kind of way
that I still love him.

343
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,636
With all his faults.
He's never home.

344
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,553
And so he hangs out
in some bar downtown.

345
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,396
As far as our sex life goes,
he's not exactly Don Juan.

346
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,312
It's more like Don of the Dead.

347
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,040
I think we get the gist here.

348
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,795
So nothing went on.

349
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,872
Nothing. Vera and Ron happen
to be two of the sweetest people

350
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,508
I ever ran across. They actually
changed my mind

351
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,033
about this filthy business.

352
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,873
Then I walk in here,
and I'm right back in the sewer.

353
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,790
Well, you'll pardon me
if I go home now, won't you?

354
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,794
I mean, suddenly
I feel like a shower.

355
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,438
Hey-- You know--

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,431
I'm gonna miss him.

357
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,512
I...

358
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,955
Well...

359
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,908
...that's good news then, right, Norm?

360
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,479
Yeah, I guess so.

361
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,918
So I guess we don't have to go out and
find somebody to have an affair with.

362
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,752
Guess not.

363
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,518
Norm, can I ask you something?

364
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,079
Yeah.

365
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,794
When we kissed before,
did anything happen?

366
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,269
Of course something happened.
Why would you ask that?

367
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,476
You don't believe what Vera said
about our sex life?

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,517
- No, no, not at all.
- Okay. Fine.

369
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,951
It's just that, well, you know,

370
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,953
just because Ron and Vera
didn't do anything

371
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,236
doesn't mean that we have to...

372
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,358
Well, what I'm trying to say is,

373
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,353
is that when we kissed
something happened to me.

374
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,115
When I heard that tape, Phyllis,
something happened to me.

375
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,714
I realized how much Vera
means to me.

376
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,392
Well, then, why don't you just run
on home to your precious little wife?

377
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,277
All right, I'm gonna.
I'm gonna do just that.

378
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,389
Right after a couple more beers.

379
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,232
- I'm sorry, Norm.
- No, no, no.

380
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,836
You know, in a strange kind of way,
I like Vera.

381
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,799
Yeah, well, that's the only kind
of way you can.

382
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,755
Oh, stop it.

383
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,558
Yeah. I kind of like her too.

384
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,430
- You know, she's a lucky woman.
- Come on.

385
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,796
You are a definite hunk.

386
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,994
Bye-bye.

387
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,515
Norm Peterson...

388
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,872
...hunk.

389
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,438
- Hi there.
- Get lost.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right.
