1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,032
Hey, Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,434
- Great game.
- Yeah. Hey, look,

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,272
they're showing chicks
in the stands every--

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,079
Oh, look at that one.
Come to papa!

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,313
Oh, yeah, Cliffie, they didn't build that
stadium in Foxboro for nothing, pal.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,517
They sure didn't.
I'll bet it cost millions.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,315
I suppose you're wondering
why a person of my breeding

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,189
would be working among
the lumpen proletariat.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,350
Do you mind?
I'm researching a novel,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,789
and working here gives me
insight into their simple pleasures.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,068
Oh, wait, wait. They're zooming in
on a cheerleader here.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,669
I think I've zoomed in
on that one myself.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,156
This language supplies the rich texture
that distinguished Fitzgerald's work.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,430
Cliffie, here comes the wave.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,555
Well, you have to go along with them,
or they get testy.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,478
That's good. Good.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,637
Seeing Baryshnikov dance Giselle
was the experience of a lifetime.

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,960
When he took the stage in his cabriole,
it was breathtaking.

19
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,752
- I'd never seen his Albrecht before.
- You mean he split his tights?

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,990
I wish.

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,633
Hey, Diane, you got a minute?

22
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,799
Listen, I want you to know
that you are the last person on earth

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,154
that I would ask for help.

24
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,470
But I figure you've been in college
for a zillion years,

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,073
so you must have
picked up something.

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,951
- Now that you've buttered me up...
- Well, my kid Gino,

27
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,475
he made this generator
for his school science fair,

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,393
- and he can't get it to work.
- What's the problem?

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,790
He's not very smart.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,319
Here, take a look at this thing.

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,029
If you're asking me to do
Gino's homework for him, I won't.

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,435
It's unethical.

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,037
- Hey, Mrs T?
- What?

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,113
You know, you ought to ask
Mr Clavin. He's very sharp.

35
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,075
He's got more information in his whole
head than I got in my little finger.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,238
- You got that backwards.
- See?

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,351
Oh, yeah, Carla, it is common
knowledge that I'm scientifically handy.

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,910
As a matter of fact, I spent a good part
of my youth in a laboratory.

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,394
And you'd still be there today

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,279
if the chimpanzee hadn't taught you
how to open your cage.

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,870
Hey. Will you look at that?

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,913
One of those
new marital aids, huh?

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,479
Okay, Clavin,
the science fair is in one week.

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,632
This is your chance to either
gain my respect or lose your tonsils.

45
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,195
Hey, well,
thanks for the opportunity, Carla.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,278
So, Norm, what do you say?
You wanna give me a hand here?

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,195
No. I think I'll pass,
Dr Frankenstein.

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,755
Cliff, have one on the house
here for your good deed.

49
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,678
Oh, thank you, Sammy.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,234
What about one for lgor?

51
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,878
Sam, who's sitting here?

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,878
I don't know, but his coat's
been taking up bar space all night.

53
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,195
So I've noticed.
Cashmere. Very nice.

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,316
Hand stitching. Tortoiseshell buttons.
This is a very expensive garment.

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,476
Doesn't look that expensive to me.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,032
It has a Bemberg lining.

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,515
Oh, well, no fair, now.
You didn't mention that.

58
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,358
I'm gonna hang it up.
Oh, a pipe smoker.

59
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,876
I don't believe it's a domestic blend.
Sam, what do you think?

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,710
- I don't smell anything.
- Of course not.

61
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,189
Your olfactory senses have
been destroyed

62
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,112
by that cologne you
marinate in.

63
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,237
Oh, I should've known.
Of course, it's a perique blend.

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,074
Jack Meechan, my father's partner,
used to smoke it.

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,079
The memory's so clearly
etched in my mind.

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,472
He'd sit in his office smoking his pipe.
I'd beg to sit in his lap, and he'd say,

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,592
"Okay, little miss,
but you have to pay the toll first."

68
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,512
So I'd give him a big hug,
and then he'd ask,

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,113
"How about a tip
for the gatekeeper?"

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,636
So I'd give him a peck on the cheek,
and he'd toss me in the air, yelling,

71
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,873
"Who's your favourite uncle?" And
I'd squeal, "Uncle Jack, Uncle Jack."

72
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,397
Was this before or after
you met me?

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,235
This is weird. What are you
making a big deal about the coat for?

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,273
I was merely trying to conjure up
an image of the owner.

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,150
There's nothing wrong with that.
Fantasy's healthy. Everybody does it.

76
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,550
Didn't you ever
fantasize about me?

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,432
Yeah, I guess I did.

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,352
And I you.
What did you fantasize about?

79
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,632
Mostly that you'd stop
using phrases like, "And I you."

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,714
Okay, Watson, fire up.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,672
Cliffie, are you all right?

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,549
It went right from my neck
to my lower regions, Norm.

83
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,400
- Anything we can do?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,994
Crank it up again.

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,589
Woody, would you add up
these receipts for me, please?

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,233
Sure.

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,557
There's eight of them.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,115
Thank you, Woody.
That's what I got too.

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,149
Hey, Sam, this guy
never came back for his coat.

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,397
Probably saw Diane sniffing it.

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,630
- Night, all.
- Night, Woody.

92
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,759
- Okay, Sam, lost and found.
- Give me that.

93
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,910
Maybe there's some identification.

94
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,672
No wallet.
Well, there must be some clue here.

95
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,590
You see?
Two tickets to the Grand Kabuki.

96
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,873
So he likes to watch
two fat guys with diapers butt heads.

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,596
- What's that tell you?
- That you're an idiot.

98
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,359
You're confusing sumo wrestling
with classic Japanese theatre.

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,953
Gee, please don't tell the guys.

100
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,949
A dried rose. What a romantic.

101
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,668
Could it be a memento from a golden
midi d'amour in some sylvan setting?

102
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,396
What's that?
A classy way of saying a nooner?

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,958
Boy, you're really losing it here.

104
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,113
You know, you can't tell what a guy's
like by what he's got in his pocket.

105
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,268
I certainly can.
What do you have in your pockets?

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,711
Why don't you check it out
yourself and you tell me.

107
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,354
I think my point is made.

108
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,551
Has it occurred to you this guy may
look like Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy?

109
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,831
I can tell you right now

110
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,077
that the owner of this coat
could well be the most attractive man

111
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,834
I've ever encountered,
whatever he looks like.

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,076
Down, girl, down.

113
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,989
What a person looks like has
nothing to do with who that person is.

114
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,476
If my face were transposed
on another soul, would it matter?

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,399
To the poor sap
who got it, it would.

116
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,714
Cheers.

117
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,990
Oh, well, hold on a sec. I'll check.

118
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,628
Have we seen a cashmere coat
with Bemberg lining around here?

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,829
Sam.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,072
Yeah, why don't you talk
to our coat-check girl.

121
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,398
The dream man
for Miss Chambers.

122
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,473
Hello.
My name is Diane Chambers,

123
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,431
and I want you to rest assured that
your lovely coat is safe in my charge.

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,877
I think we have a bad connection.

125
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,672
Your car phone?

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,430
You know,
I imagined you had a car phone.

127
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,033
Well, what I meant was, is we were
playing this game, wondering

128
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,236
what you'd be like
based on your coat.

129
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,470
Me?
Well, close your eyes and imagine.

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,558
Oh, no, don't.
We don't want you rear-ending a bus.

131
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,076
Oh, forgive my merry sense of
humour. I get it from my mother's side.

132
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,550
- Oh, my God.
- He sounds wonderful.

133
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,792
Really? Well, why don't you
ask him out, then.

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,638
Yes.

135
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,231
Listen, you sound like
a charming man.

136
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,916
If it's not too forward, perhaps we
could go for an espresso sometime?

137
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,270
Sometime?
Now, there's a commitment for you.

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,518
On second thought,
I'm getting off work now.

139
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,359
If you're not busy,
we could do it tonight.

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,308
Oh, we're both such spontaneous
madcaps, aren't we?

141
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,430
You're right down the block?
Momentarily, then.

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,993
Making a date with a stranger over
the telephone is a big mistake, Diane.

143
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,720
I tried it.
It was nothing but trouble.

144
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,758
Of course,
mine was an obscene phone call.

145
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,476
I hope this works out. Busted
expectations are a real bummer.

146
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,353
- I won't be disappointed.
- No, no, I was talking about him.

147
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,389
Hey, hey, hey. Here comes
Mr Right down the steps as we speak.

148
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,476
Socks.
He's already got my guy beat.

149
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,719
- What, are you nervous there?
- Not at all.

150
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,635
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,753
- I bet you're the guy without the coat.
- Yes, I am. Diane?

152
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,353
You should be so lucky.

153
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,310
Diane.

154
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,068
Aren't you going to introduce yourself
to this lovely gentleman?

155
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,751
Of course I am. I was just waiting
for the proper moment.

156
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,554
I'm Diane Chambers.
How do you do? Welcome to Cheers.

157
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,995
I'm Stuart Sorenson.

158
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,550
- Well.
- Yes.

159
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,510
- Oh, good, you have my coat.
- Ah, yes.

160
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,592
I can't tell you how grateful I am
for you taking such good care of it.

161
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,473
Oh, it was my pleasure.
It's a lovely garment.

162
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,914
Did you get it on the Continent?

163
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,669
- France.
- "The Continent." Nice try, Diane.

164
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,353
Hi, Stuart, I'm Sam Malone. I haven't
seen you in here before, have l?

165
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,192
Well, I'm new to the Boston area.

166
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,193
I'm in the midst of restoring
a carriage house on Beacon Hill.

167
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,635
And I needed a break,
so I just wandered in here.

168
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,910
- It's a nice little pub you have.
- Well, thank you.

169
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,959
- That makes you a carpenter, huh?
- Sam, he's probably an architect.

170
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,038
- Why, yes, I am an architect.
- An architect, you say?

171
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,919
- Did you hear that, Sam?
- Three times.

172
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,756
Listen, Diane, about that date, I realise
we made it over the phone and--

173
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,070
Well, here's your chance
to back out.

174
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
This lady's not going to let you
off that easily.

175
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,875
But it was a nice try there, Stuart.

176
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,230
Do you know a place
still open for espresso?

177
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,352
As a matter of fact,
I know a wonderful little boîte.

178
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,159
Every time I go there,
I'm reminded of the Café Lumière,

179
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,231
opposite the Bois de Boulogne.

180
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,112
I know exactly
the one you're talking about.

181
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,157
It's in the lobby
of the Hôtel Sainte-Cécile.

182
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,351
- Yes.
- Well.

183
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,750
That's the only place I stay
when I'm in Paris.

184
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,076
Oh, I'm sorry.
That sounded so pretentious.

185
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,996
There's my car phone.

186
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,790
That sounded pretentious too.

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,592
Oh, hell, so I'm pretentious.

188
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,955
- Do you mind if I go get that?
- Not at all. I'll meet you at your car.

189
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,520
There's a back way out of here.
You gotta shinny up a drainpipe,

190
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,150
crawl over some broken glass,
but I think it may be worth it.

191
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,310
What are you talking about?
I feel totally vindicated.

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,357
He's everything
I thought he would be.

193
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,757
He's charming, intelligent,
self-deprecating.

194
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,155
I didn't hear "attractive" in there.

195
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,677
- I find him attractive.
- Oh, come on, Diane.

196
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,913
On a scale of one to ten,
me being a 12, of course,

197
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,473
where are you gonna rate Stuart?

198
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,956
Let's change that to lQ.

199
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,113
While your score would remain 12...

200
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,191
...his would skyrocket.

201
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,233
It's too bad you're not gonna be
gazing across the table at his lQ.

202
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,475
Why don't you just admit
you're jealous.

203
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,673
All right, I am.
You're right, but can you blame me?

204
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,878
Sam, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

205
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,356
You bet I am.
I'd kill for a car phone.

206
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,990
Two vodka tonics.

207
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,835
- So where's the stick?
- She and Stuart are on another date.

208
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,918
They went to see a play.
I think it's a whodunit.

209
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,792
With him in the audience,
it's a what-is-it.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,230
Hey, hey, come on.
Lighten up on him, will you?

211
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,038
He turned out to be kind of
a nice fella.

212
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,958
Gonna have to give
Diane credit on this one.

213
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,917
Her intuition proved to be right.

214
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,830
I'm a great believer in intuition.
It's like when I first saw you, Sam.

215
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,998
Something told me you were
super smooth with the ladies.

216
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,668
Maybe it was that time you
walked out of here with four of them,

217
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,398
one on each arm.

218
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,993
You know,

219
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,994
you always just seem to know
the right moves.

220
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,237
Sometimes I like to just stand around
and watch you operate.

221
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,518
- It's like going to school.
- I never really thought of it like that.

222
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,915
Well, yes, I have.

223
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,717
Well, so there we were,

224
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,516
me and 25 soaking wet
Japanese architects in my apartment,

225
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,796
and I'm out of Brie.

226
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,917
Oh, Stuart, what a life you've led.

227
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,509
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll get our drinks.

228
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,551
Hey, Stuart, how was the theatre?

229
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,432
- Great fun, Sam.
- Oh, good.

230
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,279
Hey, Miss Chambers?

231
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,120
I've been meaning to tell you,
I really like your friend Stuart.

232
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,793
Oh, thank you, Woody.

233
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,279
Hey, you think you could get him
to do that great trick for me?

234
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,079
What trick?

235
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,875
The one Sam says he does when he
makes the clock stop by looking at it.

236
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,671
Wasn't that just supposed to be
between you, me and the lamppost?

237
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,633
Well, look at her.
It's an easy mistake.

238
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,678
Excuse me.
I have to speak with Sam.

239
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,394
I'll be back before
the bouquet leaves the glasses.

240
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,076
Might I speak with you briefly?

241
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,238
You might,
but I don't think you will.

242
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,512
I'm sorry about that clock comment.

243
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,592
I made it before I realised
what a nice guy he is.

244
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,439
I'm such a pooh.

245
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,038
- Beg your pardon?
- You heard me. A pooh.

246
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,274
After all these years,
I have to admit it. I'm all talk.

247
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,835
Oh, well, of course you are, honey,
but we've all gotten used to that.

248
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,958
Sam, I have spent the week
with a person

249
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,958
who can converse
on a multitude of subjects,

250
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,436
who listens when I talk,

251
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,474
who treats me with respect.

252
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,875
And a person with whom
I can think of nothing but,

253
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,600
"Why aren't you great-looking?"

254
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,791
Or, "Why can't I stop wishing
you were great-looking?"

255
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,870
This is probably not the right time
to say I told you so,

256
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,430
so if you could just remind me
to get to it later.

257
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,910
Oh, Sam.

258
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,793
I'm small and vain and petty.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,788
Will you stop being hard on yourself?
I mean, that's my job here. Come on.

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,231
You had, what, few casual
dates with him? What's the big deal?

261
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,715
Yes, but as often happens
in my life,

262
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,475
this gentleman is becoming
much too serious, much too fast.

263
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,199
He's wearing that smitten look
I know so well.

264
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,388
I've got to do something
before it goes any further.

265
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,158
Uh-huh, I see.

266
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,070
For the first time in my life I can't bring
myself to tell the truth to a man so...

267
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,632
...I need a lie.

268
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,394
And God forgive me,
I'm coming to you for help.

269
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,751
Well, I'm flattered.

270
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,033
All right, let me... Let me give this
a little thought here.

271
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,597
All right. All right, I've never passed
this one on before, but I think it's--

272
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,150
I think it's the ticket here.
It's neat, fast, clean and, best of all,

273
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,471
it makes them want to get away
from you. Now, here's what you do.

274
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,116
You tell him that you have
a contagious skin condition

275
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,670
and that insanity
runs in your family.

276
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,712
Very sensitive.

277
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,039
Well, thank you. It's a gift.

278
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,954
Sam, I have never been
more grateful to you than I am now.

279
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,112
I just looked into the face
of insensitivity and dishonesty,

280
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,633
and it made me blanch.

281
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,550
I am going out there,
and I'm going to break up with Stuart.

282
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,880
But I'm going to do it honestly,
straightforwardly and yet, caringly.

283
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,113
I'll tell him the truth of my feelings, that
I'm not attracted to him romantically,

284
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,748
although I am very attracted to him
as a friend.

285
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,675
And I'll say it in a way that

286
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,628
he will accept and understand
and be grateful for.

287
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,434
Do you even begin to understand
what I'm trying to say?

288
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,159
Everything except the part where you
changed your name to Blanche.

289
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,031
Goodbye, Sam.

290
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,836
Goodbye, Blanche.

291
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,073
Thank you.

292
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,152
- Listen, Stuart--
- Diane, I'm sorry.

293
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,790
I can't put this off any longer.
There's something I have to tell you.

294
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,197
Diane, for the first time in my life,

295
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,158
I'm thinking of making a permanent
commitment with a woman.

296
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,678
Stuart, I have a contagious skin
disease and insanity runs in my family.

297
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,793
My God, Diane,
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,911
Thank you.
I thought you should know.

299
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,790
Well, that makes me feel
a little selfish,

300
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,190
talking about my good news
after hearing that.

301
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,598
Your good news?

302
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,113
Diane, what I'm trying to say is...

303
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,959
...there's someone else.

304
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,995
She's someone I knew
before I met you.

305
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,158
I honestly thought it was over
between us, but--

306
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,558
Well, we spoke earlier today, and
we decided to work things through.

307
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,430
You're telling the truth,
aren't you, Stuart?

308
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,395
Well, that's the most
wonderful thing I ever heard.

309
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,073
It's tearing me apart inside.

310
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,630
I'm a total wreck.

311
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,193
Don't give up hope, Diane.
No relationship is guaranteed.

312
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,834
Except yours.
Don't you doubt for a moment.

313
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,352
- We're talking ironclad here.
- Well, thank you.

314
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,279
By the way, have you seen
a doctor about that condition of yours?

315
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,469
What con--?

316
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,518
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm seeing a wonderful man.

317
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,591
He's almost
cleared it up completely.

318
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,514
He's about got
that insanity thing licked too.

319
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,595
He's a skin and brain man.

320
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,953
It's a new specialty.

321
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,069
Sounds fascinating.

322
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,638
Well, Diane, I'm really glad we had
this chance to know each other.

323
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,353
Me too.

324
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,358
- Goodbye, Diane.
- Goodbye, Stuart.

325
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,149
Hey, congratulations.
You're free and clear.

326
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,069
Don't congratulate me.
He's a terrific guy.

327
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,795
And I cast him aside
because of his appearance.

328
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,593
I'm greatly ashamed.

329
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,030
Well, from where I was sitting,
it sounded like he was--

330
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,993
All right, Sam, let's not split hairs.

331
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,879
The point is, he's gone.

332
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,239
For the first time ever, I let appearance
taint my feelings toward a man.

333
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,398
Boy, you know what's wrong with you?
You just can't be honest with yourself.

334
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,313
Looks are all
that ever mattered to you.

335
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,835
What are you talking about?
That is utterly inaccurate.

336
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,553
Oh, yeah?
Want me to prove it to you?

337
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,239
Yes.

338
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,193
Who were you more crazy about
than anyone else in your entire life?

339
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,473
Not including yourself there.
Don't answer. It was me.

340
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,035
And there was only one reason
why you ever went out with me,

341
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,474
and that was
because of my looks.

342
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,230
- Not entirely.
- Yes, entirely.

343
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,592
Name one other reason
why anyone would go out with me.

344
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,035
Go on, name one.
You can't, can you?

345
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,990
No, Sam, I can't.
