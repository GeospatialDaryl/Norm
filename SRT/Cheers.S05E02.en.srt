Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:06,890
Sam, two nights ago on the boat,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,893
you demonstrated in no uncertain terms

4
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,895
that you and I are inevitable.

5
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:14,898
You said those words I had
hoped to hear for so long,

6
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:17,267
"Will you marry me?"

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,653
Before thinking, I responded no.

8
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,939
But then I realized all I needed

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,443
was some time alone to clear my mind.

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,830
Now I have returned to you
with a resounding "yes."

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,699
Say, Sam,

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,668
I don't like it any more than you do,

13
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,038
but I've decided to accept it.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,956
Therefore, I am going to work here

15
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,458
so that when you finally accept it,

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,959
as we both know you will,

17
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,463
we can move forward to build
and nurture our relationship.

18
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,348
Excuse me. I have customers to wait on.

19
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,682
No, you...!

20
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,102
Listen, listen, I, I
don't want you here.

21
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:53,603
I don't want you in the building.

22
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,605
I don't want you on this planet.

23
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:56,606
He's crazy about me.

24
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,108
No, I'm not crazy about her.

25
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,110
You make me sick to my stomach.

26
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,561
That's how I am about her.

27
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,530
We have kind of a little thing going.

28
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,033
Now, what would you like?

29
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,035
I'm sorry. This isn't my table.

30
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,538
Miss Chambers?

31
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,541
You know I'm your friend

32
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,543
and friends should stick together,

33
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,546
so I'm really happy you're back.

34
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,047
Oh, Woody, thanks.

35
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,802
Well, kind of happy,
'cause Sam's my friend, too.

36
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:27,637
So I can't be too happy

37
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:32,142
or else he'll can me, which
will make me really sad.

38
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:36,146
And I know you, as my friend,
wouldn't be happy about that.

39
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,150
So, whatever you do, don't
tell Sam what I just told you.

40
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,069
What did you just tell me?

41
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,938
Perfect.

42
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:51,194

Sam, what do you think of
Vivaldi at the ceremony?

58
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:02,899
You can invite anybody
you want. I don't care.

59
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm not going to be...

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,902
As a matter of fact,
nobody's going to be there

61
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,770
'cause there's not
going to be a wedding,

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,689
but if you want to
work here, that's fine.

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,573
You got my blessings.

64
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:13,409
I'm glad you've come around
to see the wisdom of it.

65
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,694
Oh, there's wisdom in it.

66
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
There's tons of wisdom.

67
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
Let me tell you why.

68
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
I want you to have
a front-row seat here

69
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,667
for all the luscious babes

70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,169
I'm going to have marching
through here every night.

71
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,671
As a matter of fact, from now on,

72
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,041
it's casaba city, and
you're looking at the mayor.

73
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,794
You'll pardon me if I don't
refer to you as "Your Honor."

74
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:36,132
You know, I'm going down to the
Cape this weekend for a little R&R.

75
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,134
That's Rhonda and room service.

76
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,887
(all hooting)

77
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,688
I love the Cape.

78
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,190
We spent so many happy hours there.

79
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,692
Sightseeing, talking...

80
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,693
Yeah, well, Rhonda and I

81
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,194
aren't going to have
any time for sightseeing.

82
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,196
We're going to be just
coming up for air long enough

83
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,564
to order some of that fish head soup.

84
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,815
Bouillabaisse.

85
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,817
No, I mean it.

86
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,321
Fine.

87
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,322
I couldn't care less.

88
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,823
I'll just continue on,

89
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,326
secure in the knowledge
that you love me.

90
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,328
I did... I did not say I loved you.

91
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,829
You proposed to me.

92
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,331
Love and marriage go together.

93
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,832
Why else would you propose to someone?

94
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,419
Nevertheless do what you will,

95
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,922
but keep in mind that
you might try to sabotage

96
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,923
this tryst of yours

97
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,926
because deep in your heart,
you know it's not right.

98
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,311
We are.

99
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,062
Oh, yeah, I see what you're doing here.

100
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,064
You're trying to plant a
little seed in my brain.

101
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,065
Oh, don't be silly.

102
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,067
I know of nothing that
grows in solid rock.

103
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,069
Yeah.

104
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,939
Hi, everybody.

105
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,909
(dejectedly): Hi, Diane. Welcome back.

106
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,664
Carla, you don't seem
surprised that I'm working here.

107
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:42,949
I knew you'd return.

108
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,951
Your kind always does.

109
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,954
Like roaches after atomic testing.

110
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,673
Well, I must say I'm relieved

111
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,175
to see you act this way.

112
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,678
I was expecting something
a little more violent.

113
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:56,679
No.

114
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,599
I'm glad you're back.

115
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,100
You see, I got this theory.

116
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,103
If you and Sam hang around
each other long enough,

117
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,472
one of you is going to kill the other.

118
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,309
Now, if Sam kills you, fine.

119
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,811
If you kill Sam, I'll turn you in,

120
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,697
get a reward, and you'll get the chair.

121
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,899
(imitates electrical crackling)

122
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,068
Either way I come up a winner.

123
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,903
I think we're becoming friends.

124
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,905
Let's have a slumber party sometime.

125
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,909
Hey, there's a kitty-cat in here.

126
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,911
A guy gave 'em to me on
the way in this morning.

127
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,915
You know my kids have been giving me a
lot of crap about not having any pets,

128
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,418
so I figure Max here ought
to shut 'em up for a while.

129
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,919
Well, what do you call

130
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,920
the little one?

131
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,921
What little one?

132
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,424
You know, all that wheat's
making you hallucinate.

133
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,011
Oh, great, she's having babies!

134
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,512
There's another one!

135
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,014
You're a farmboy.

136
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
What are you supposed
to do to stop this?

137
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,521
Well, it's too late
to go to the drugstore.

138
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,529
I swear, I swear, this cat
was not pregnant when I got it.

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,531
The minute it becomes a Tortelli,

140
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,533
it starts dropping 'em like...

141
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,619
(phone rings)

142
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,120
Oh, yeah, there you are.

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,005
Well, I'm off for my weekend, Diane.

144
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,257
Cheers. Oh, by the way, did I tell you

145
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:15,758
that Rhonda was double-jointed?

146
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,427
Hey, Sam,

147
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,761
it's for you.

148
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:23,216
Yeah, hello.

149
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,217
Oh, hey, Rhonda.

150
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,719
I was just talking about you.

151
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,723
Oh, oh, no, don't do this to me.

152
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,225
Well...

153
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,612
can't you be born again on Monday?

154
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,148
All right, all right,

155
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,450
Well, you, too.

156
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,452
Whew, do you believe that?

157
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,320
She canceled on me.

158
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,655
Women.

159
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,541
Reminds me of what my
Uncle Henry used to say.

160
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,876
Oh, yeah? What was that, Woody?

161
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,244
Women.

162
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,001
Hey, uh, Sammy, don't let
Diane hear about Rhonda.

163
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,754
She'll load that info into
her shotgun and take aim, huh?

164
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,091
Yeah, no one is going to
ruin Sam Malone's weekend,

165
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,093
no matter what Diane says.

166
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,595
Yeah, hello, Vicki?

167
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,598
Yeah, it's Sam Malone.

168
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,602
Yeah, yeah, listen, uh,
how, how does the idea of,

169
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,606
uh, 48 hours of sun and
surf up at the Cape grab ya?

170
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,607
Oh, yeah?

171
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Well, if that grabs ya,

172
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,610
how's the idea of me
grabbing you grab you?

173
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,112
Yeah, all right.

174
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,113
All right.

175
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,114
Yeah, me, too.

176
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,117
Okay, I, I'll see ya in
about two hours then, Vicki.

177
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,618
All right. Bye-bye.

178
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,619
CLIFF: Yeah.

179
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,122
I thought her name was Rhonda.

180
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,624
Well, uh... Rhonda canceled.

181
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,876
But that's good.

182
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,210
That's good because I like,

183
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,095
I like Vicki better than Rhonda.

184
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,098
As a matter of fact, I kind of
hope that, that Vicki cancels

185
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,602
because I have somebody even
better waiting in the wings.

186
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,853
I know. Me.

187
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,054
No, no, not you.

188
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,282
You know, Vicki, I just want you to know

189
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,785
that this is going to
be the most beautiful,

190
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,288
terrific, special
weekend of my entire life.

191
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,158
Listen, you don't need to keep
selling me on this weekend.

192
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,159
No, I...

193
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm sold. All right.

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,161
I'm famished.

195
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,412
I wish they'd take our order.

196
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,246
Oh, they'll be here. Don't worry.

197
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,499
Nothing's going to ruin
this weekend, I'll tell ya.

198
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,301
Ah, perfect.

199
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,803
Have you decided?

200
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,720
What'll you have?

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,222
Ah, what's the Catch of the Day?

202
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,223
You mean besides me?

203
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,724
(laughing)

204
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,227
Ah, this is great. Isn't this great?

205
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,728
We're having fun, right.

206
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:33,729
I'll take the scallops.

207
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,731
Yeah, uh, that... two of
those. That'll be good.

208
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,734
Oh, geez!

209
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,236
Are you sure you're okay?

210
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,737
Yeah, are you kidding me?

211
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:42,738
That was fun for me.

212
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,240
Wasn't it fun for you?

213
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,242
I mean, it's spontaneous, refreshing.

214
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:47,243
Oh, it's great.

215
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:48,244
I'll move you to another table.

216
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,112
Don't you dare. This is perfect.

217
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,748
Thank you very much.

218
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,534
You know, someone tried to convince me

219
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,919
that this weekend was going
to be a total disaster.

220
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,621
VICKI: Really? Who?

221
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,422
That person right there!

222
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,924
Sam!

223
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:12,969
What a surprise.

224
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,337
Hello.

225
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,588
Hello. I'm Vicki.

226
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,589
I'm...

227
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,391
Leaving immediately.

228
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,225
Diane.

229
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,227
Are you enjoying your weekend?

230
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,729
Of course she's enjoying her weekend.

231
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,231
It's a fantastic weekend.

232
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,732
Did you notice your table's all wet?

233
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,734
That's 'cause we want it that way.

234
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,736
As a matter of fact, we ordered it wet.

235
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,738
Hey, you know, I think it's drying out

236
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
a little bit, don't you?

237
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,241
Here you go. That's better.

238
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,742
Excuse me, Miss.

239
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,745
There's a telephone
call for you at the desk.

240
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,113
Thank you.

241
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,865
I'll be right back.

242
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:48,371
I'll miss you.

243
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:49,872
What the hell are you doing here?

244
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:53,376
Mm, you know, all your talk
of a lovely weekend at the Cape

245
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,878
made me realize how much I
needed to get away myself.

246
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,380
It's just the most

247
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,881
incredible coincidence

248
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,883
that we ended up at the same place.

249
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:01,884
I know what you're trying to do.

250
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,886
You're trying to rattle
me, but the joke's on you,

251
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:04,887
because I'm better under pressure.

252
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:05,888
I don't rattle.

253
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:07,890
Only when you shake your head.

254
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,727
Have fun. Okay.

255
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,230
You know, you just guaranteed

256
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,732
this is going to be the
most perfect weekend ever.

257
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,736
Oh, good, yeah, you're back.

258
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:21,737
Yeah, that's perfect.

259
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,739
Now why don't you sit down over there.

260
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,741
This might be wet here.

261
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,126
Sam? Hmm?

262
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,744
I'm afraid I have to leave.

263
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,914
Oh, God, no, don't say that, please.

264
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm sorry. Look, that was
my sister on the phone.

265
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,751
Our grandmother's ill.

266
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,253
I have to fly to Idaho.

267
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,754
Why? You're not a doctor.

268
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,090
Please, please, don't...

269
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,475
Sam, I'm sorry this happened,

270
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,759
but you're going to have

271
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,728
to drive me back.

272
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,229
No, no, uh...

273
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,231
I have to stay here.

274
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,733
Uh, I'll call you a cab.

275
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,735
Well, as long as you
don't go out of your way.

276
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,103
What, again, Vicki?

277
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,605
Even rabbits take a break to eat.

278
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,245
When you're finished there, go upstairs

279
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,248
and help the lady in Mr.
Malone's room with her bags.

280
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,750
WAITER: She's checking out?

281
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,752
Her grandmother's ill.

282
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,253
(Diane laughing)

283
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,125
I'd heard she was dead.

284
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,010
It's nice to know she's just sick.

285
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,186
WOMAN (on TV): Pat,
I'd like to buy a vowel.

286
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,637
A vowel?

287
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:29,972
There are only two spaces left.

288
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,023
She wants to buy a vowel.

289
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,359
Where do they get these people?

290
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,528
(knocking)

291
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:40,983
Who is it?

292
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,485
Room service.

293
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,488
Oh, yeah. Yeah, good, thank you.

294
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,989
Put... put it right over there.

295
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:47,990
Okay.

296
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:56,499
I bet you're wondering why

297
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,000
I ordered two of everything

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,502
when there's only me up here, huh?

299
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,504
Uh, no, not really.

300
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:06,008
Well, actually, it's 'cause
I want to give the impression

301
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:07,393
that there are two people in the room.

302
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,845
Well, you fooled me.

303
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh.

304
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,015
Good, good, good.

305
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,518
Where are my hot fudge sundaes?

306
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,019
I couldn't fit 'em on the tray.

307
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,020
I'll be right back up.

308
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,522
All right. Great, great.

309
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,524
Uh, make sure you parade around
the lobby a couple of times

310
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:24,026
before you bring 'em on up. Will ya?

311
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,528
Sure.

312
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,032
(phone rings)

313
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,427
Hello.

314
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,294
Hi, Sam.

315
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,679
How's it going up there?

316
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,049
Uh, fine. Fine.

317
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,050
(giggles)

318
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,555
Oh, don't do that, Vicki. I'm ticklish.

319
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:56,058
Sam, I feel an apology is in order.

320
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,060
I may have made your friend Vicki

321
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,812
a bit uncomfortable earlier today.

322
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,647
Well, she's plenty
comfortable right now,

323
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,649
so, uh, I'll pass on her message.

324
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,533
Bye-bye, Diane.

325
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,901
No, no, Sam.

326
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,403
I wouldn't feel right

327
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,905
unless I expressed my
feelings personally.

328
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:11,907
Let me speak with her, please.

329
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,295
Shoot.

330
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,666
She's in the, uh, the
bathroom right now.

331
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,752
She's tickling you from the bathroom?

332
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,554
Well, she just went in there.

333
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,425
She... she always runs into the
bathroom after she tickles me.

334
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,594
Perhaps it's nausea.

335
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:37,900
Sam, I, I really want to
apologize to her face-to-face.

336
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,901
I'll be right up.

337
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,352
No, no, no, no, don't...
(line disconnects)

338
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,891
Oh, good, good, good.

339
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,893
Do me a favor, will
ya? I'll pay you $50.

340
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,394
I beg your pardon.

341
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,395
Let's go, Harvey.

342
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,397
No, no, no, please.
No funny stuff at all.

343
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,900
Uh, come, come on now.
You'll be saving my life here.

344
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,901
Come, come on in. Come in.

345
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,902
Now hold it now. Just a minute here.

346
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,403
I promise you.

347
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,404
No weird stuff.

348
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,406
I just want your wife
to go in the bathroom

349
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,407
and make some noises.

350
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,293
What kind of noises?

351
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,128
I don't know, uh... woman kind of stuff.

352
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,996
Like you're getting all
dolled up for some hot action.

353
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
What does that sound like?

354
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,885
Uh, eh, I don't know.

355
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,386
Whatever you and Harvey do...

356
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
Never mind. Never mind.

357
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
Just, uh...

358
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
Here you go. $50.

359
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
(knocking)

360
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
Hi, Sam. Hey.

361
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,150
Where's Vicki?

362
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,985
She's, uh, still in the bathroom.

363
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,488
Well, I'll just wait. Huh?

364
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,441
No, uh...

365
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,443
You know, um...

366
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,945
this could take a little while here.

367
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:13,946
Why don't you, uh,

368
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,334
why don't you just yell your
apologies through the door here?

369
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,201
Oh, that's silly.

370
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,703
I'll be here all weekend.

371
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:21,704
I can certainly wait.

372
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,873
(woman laughing)

373
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,261
(laughing)

374
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,931
She sure is busy.

375
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,183
Is that enough

376
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,186
or should we snap some towels?

377
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,695
It's the, uh, bathroom inspector.

378
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,696
It's a new thing.

379
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
Sam...

380
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,484
let's call an end to
this nonsense right now.

381
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,486
I don't care how rough you were on her;

382
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,490
that is not Vicki.

383
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,492
See, I know Vicki left.

384
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,996
I've known all along.

385
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,999
And you let me go through
this whole stupid act?

386
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,502
Well, I wanted to
see how far you'd go--

387
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,755
ordering two sets of meals,

388
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,556
leaving empty bottles of Vitamin E

389
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,559
outside your door...

390
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,927
Yeah, well, what about you?

391
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:21,313
You know, coming all the
way up here to spy on me?

392
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,183
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

393
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,351
Yeah?

394
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,822
What's the use?

395
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,191
We both look like imbeciles.

396
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,526
All we do is find new ways

397
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:38,530
to humiliate each other.

398
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,417
I humiliate you by saying "no"

399
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,370
to your sweet proposal.

400
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,756
You humiliate me by
rejecting my retraction.

401
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,675
You carry off this ridiculous charade.

402
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,593
I spy on you in hotel rooms.

403
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,096
It's become sick and degrading.

404
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,097
And, quite frankly,

405
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,466
I'm embarrassed to be a
part of it, Sam. Yeah, well,

406
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:59,301
I'm not too thrilled
you're part of it either.

407
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,689
Here you go, pal.

408
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,690
Oh...

409
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,696
Oh, yeah, yeah.

410
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,198
I guess this all looks
pretty weird, doesn't it?

411
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,200
Oh, nothing I haven't seen before.

412
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,707
I believe you owe us $50.

413
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,209
Now there's a new one.

414
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,582
Boy, Carla, you know, I never thought

415
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,585
you'd be able to unload all
those kittens in one night.

416
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,087
Yeah, it was just a simple matter

417
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,588
of marketing technique, you know.

418
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,090
Giving away a beer with each kitten

419
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,475
really did the trick.

420
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,765
Come on.

421
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,766
Here, Toots,

422
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,687
time for your first cab ride.

423
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,689
You know you guys are
really gonna love Vera.

424
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:56,191
She has legs just
like a scratching post.

425
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,593
Oh, good evening.

426
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
Good evening.

427
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,859
Oh, it's you.

428
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:34,229
Small world.

429
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,614
Mm...

430
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,734
I thought I was eating late
enough to avoid seeing you.

431
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,319
Me, too.

432
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,204
The only reason why I
waited so long to eat.

433
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,656
Oh, I thought perhaps it was because

434
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,158
you've been eating for two.

435
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,715
(sighs)

436
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:57,920
I'm kind of glad you're here.

437
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,671
I've been sitting here
driving myself crazy.

438
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,223
When we used to come here,

439
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,393
wasn't there a lobster
trap out in the lobby?

440
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,812
Oh, yeah.

441
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,814
Yeah, I guess the
lobsters finally wised up

442
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,682
and starting coming through the kitchen.

443
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,734
(laughs)

444
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,027
By the way, I suppose
I owe you an apology

445
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,529
for being here this weekend.

446
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,948
In retrospect, I guess...

447
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:28,867
it was probably a mistake.

448
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,669
Probably?

449
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,923
I'd say "definitely"
if you were to admit

450
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,927
that it was a mistake to
flaunt your date in front of me.

451
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,880
Apology accepted.

452
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,936
Boy, you know the one thing
I really hate is to eat alone.

453
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,805
I always feel like
someone's looking at me.

454
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,974
I'm the only one here.

455
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:53,775
Well, you're looking at me.

456
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,201
Then you can either join me or
I can eat with my eyes closed.

457
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,988
Well, I hate to have
you butter your knuckles.

458
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,740
Good.

459
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,162
Sam, you know what I remember most

460
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,164
about being here before?

461
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,165
Oh, sure, sure.

462
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:20,669
Yeah, I think the salt
air gives me extra stamina.

463
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,893
Actually, I was thinking
of the Clams Oregano,

464
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,646
but now that you mention
it, I did enjoy the...

465
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,315
salt air.

466
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:44,076
Sam, what I said before
about our relationship,

467
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,661
I'm...

468
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,945
I'm sorry I said it.

469
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,331
I was upset.

470
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,117
It may not be ideal, but...

471
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,537
it hasn't been without its moments.

472
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,041
Speaking of moments,

473
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,294
this, uh, is beginning
to feel like one here.

474
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,683
Yes, I think I've decided what I want,

475
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,935
and it's not on the menu.

476
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,271
Oh, you want to skip the main course

477
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,140
and jump right into the "Sammy Soufflé"?

478
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,611
I see you haven't lost
your way with words.

479
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,986
Let's go.

480
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,987
Yes, this is the perfect moment.

481
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,490
But... it is with the understanding,

482
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,376
isn't it, of...

483
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,996
what this step we're
about to take means?

484
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,247
Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

485
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,749
If they give us any trouble,

486
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:41,750
I'll just pay for both rooms.

487
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,091
What it means between us.

488
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,425
Oh, now wait, listen. Listen.

489
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,010
No, it has to mean something, Sam.

490
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,845
I'm only gonna agree to do this if,

491
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,231
if we agree that it
doesn't mean anything.

492
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,435
How can our lovemaking
not mean something?

493
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:02,571
Well, it's easy. Just concentrate.

494
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:08,443
I don't want to get caught up

495
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:10,946
in a war of words with you.

496
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:15,450
What I'm feeling right
now is very... special,

497
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,953
and I think we should go upstairs

498
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,454
and be with each other

499
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:21,957
and figure out what it means afterwards.

500
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,208
Let's go.

501
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,544
No.

502
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,045
What?

503
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,048
I-I gotta be clear what I'm doing here.

504
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,434
I mean, my gut's telling me one thing,

505
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,936
but my, my head's telling
me something quite different.

506
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:38,056
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

507
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,558
(chuckling)

508
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,059
Oh...!

509
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,060
Gotcha.

510
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,562
(laughs)

511
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,814
You were joking? (laughs)

512
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:47,399
Yeah. How's it feel? I
mean, how do you like it

513
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,618
when you get your motor all revved up

514
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,154
and then someone jerks
the rug out from under you?

515
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:57,459
Well, mixed metaphors
aside, I don't like it a bit.

516
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,960
Yeah.

517
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,964
But your point is well
taken, and I deserved that.

518
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,466
Well, great.

519
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,967
(chuckling)

520
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,469
All right.

521
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,970
Come on. Let's go.

522
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,972
No.

523
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,475
What do you mean "no"?

524
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,976
Oh, all right, I see what you doing.

525
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,478
That's good. That's, that's very funny.

526
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,479
That's... (chuckles)

527
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,231
All right. Come on.

528
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,185
No, the only place I'm going is home.

529
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:23,985
You know, it's very funny.

530
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,487
I laughed. The joke's over.

531
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,991
Sam, this is the wrong
time for physical dalliance.

532
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
It's too soon.

533
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,445
If we rush into a
physical encounter now,

534
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,947
we might ruin the much more important

535
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,833
nuptial consummation coming up.

536
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,337
Smell the old salt air.

537
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,705
Sam, please.

538
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:44,673
This is nothing to worry about.

539
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,041
We're on the right course.

540
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,960
When we're married,
you'll be happy we waited.

541
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,962
Really, this is nothing
to be upset about.

542
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:51,847
Bye-bye.

543
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,298
Fine.

544
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,300
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
I mean, it's perfect.

545
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,803
You said someone was
gonna ruin this weekend,

546
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,305
but now I'm really
gonna have some fun here.

547
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,809
Shoot.

548
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,813
Did we lose another one?

549
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,814
(groans)
