1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,912
CHEERlO CHEERS

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,673
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Carla.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,115
Sam, l'm sorry l'm late.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,317
l realise l left you here
without a waitress.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,916
What am l? Chopped liver?

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,799
No, some people enjoy chopped liver.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,278
- What got you in such a bad mood?
- l don't know. Everything.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,275
This morning l was thinking l'm not
married, l'm carrying my sixth kid.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,000
l'm broke, l live in squalor...

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,791
- l'm having a crisis of faith.
- Don't talk like that.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,157
Would a just God
be putting me through this?

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,551
Well, l know it looks
sort of bleak out there.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,712
But you just have to have patience.
Remember Job.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,759
Cliffie's right, honey.
You got a good Job here.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,795
- You're in great health...
- l don't know.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,358
l didn't want to embarrass you
in front of Carla,

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,398
but you pronounce the word ''job''.

18
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,354
Frasier, what a surprise
to see you here.

19
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,909
Diane, l've got the most exciting news.

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,435
What is it? You're positively tingling.

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,158
Sit down.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,359
l have been awarded an honour that
surpasses anything l've hoped for.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,557
lt goes beyond even my most wild
and ambitious dreams.

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,676
Are we talking Nobel Prize?

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,434
- No, we're not talking Nobel Prize.
- A Pulitzer?

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,512
- Not the Pulitzer Prize.
- A Guggenheim Fellowship.

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,390
- No, it's not a Guggenheim Fellowship.
- A canned ham? You lost the big ones.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,116
l knew l should have waited.

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,556
Diane, l have been chosen to be
this year's visiting scholar

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,517
at the University of Bologna.

31
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,630
- Frasier, that's wonderful.
- The University of Bologna?

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,237
l can't believe they need a university
for a thing like that.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,672
- l know it's a complicated meat, but...
- Coach.

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,708
The University of Bologna
is the oldest university in the world.

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,271
lt has what is arguably the finest
school of psychology in Europe.

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,476
Now inarguably the finest.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,995
Who's the dean, Oscar Mayer?

38
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,030
l hear sausage jokes
are making a comeback.

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,275
Now here's the exciting news.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,479
My teaching load will provide us
ample time to travel throughout Europe.

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,590
- Us?
- l thought you'd notice that.

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,719
l'm leaving in two weeks
and l'd love for you to come along.

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,798
Why, that would be wonderful,
wouldn't it?

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,958
- How long would we be gone?
- Six months.

45
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,750
This would be a very big undertaking.
So many details to take care of.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,992
My apartment, a passport.

47
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,676
My plants, my classes, Sam,
paper, my dry-cleaning.

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,912
- Sam?
- Well, yes.

49
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,676
You know what a devastating effect
it had on him the last time l left.

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,798
He's fragile. He can be wounded.

51
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,191
Hey, Doc.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,999
Ever seen a guy
do push-ups with his tongue?

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,072
- Well, no, l haven't.
- Watch this.

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,437
You see, Diane? Even without you
his life is very full.

55
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,630
Frasier, l'm serious.

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,873
All right. l was Sam's therapist.
l'll tell him and observe his reaction.

57
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,192
lf he shows any anxiety whatsoever,
l'll be here to assuage it.

58
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,432
- Can l have a word with you?
- Sure, Doc. What's up?

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,752
- Diane and l are going to Europe.
- Europe? Overseas?

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,994
Well, we were going to go to
the local one, but it's all booked up.

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,790
l'm going to be teaching there for six
months and Diane is going with me.

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,713
And you may never see her again.

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,599
Well, that's... l'm happy for you guys.

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,719
Maybe l should throw you a <i>bon</i>
<i>voyage</i> party. What do you think?

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,276
- You're not bothered?
- Not bothered? How delightfully naive.

66
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,113
He's repressing. Come along, Sam.

67
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,319
- l want to have a little chat with you.
- What are we going to talk about?

68
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,074
The emotions that you're
repressing right now.

69
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,677
l'm here for you and l won't leave
until you can deal with this.

70
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,789
She doesn't want to go to Europe.
She's still harbouring feelings for you.

71
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,949
- Come on, Frasier. That again?
- Yes.

72
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,999
You should have seen the look on
her face when l asked her just now.

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,119
She is a great cure
for happiness, isn't she?

74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,229
You can't expect her to jump up
and down with joy right off the bat.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,358
- l'd love to know why.
- Because Diane is Diane.

76
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,717
She's never done anything
without thinking about it.

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,030
She analyses everything.

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,272
lf you were to say,
''Can l offer you a million dollars?''

79
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,718
she'd say, ''No, no, no. That's
may l offer you a million dollars?'''

80
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,392
l admit she does have
a tendency to be cerebral.

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,869
l never pictured myself in a relationship

82
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,476
where l would be
the wild and impulsive one.

83
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,955
Let's be fair, though. She does know
how to show a man a good time.

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,114
You're right. We'd be out and she'd say,
''Look. Those guys are having fun.''

85
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,555
Come on. l'll bet she comes around.

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,271
l bet she's outside right now thinking
this whole Europe thing's a good idea.

87
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,352
- You really think so?
- Yeah, l know so.

88
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,875
- How is he?
- He'll be all right.

89
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,713
- l already got my sense of humour back.
- Good man.

90
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,871
Sam, you were really bothered
by this news?

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,037
l just used Sam as a cover. lt was me.

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,715
l was hurt that your reaction to
my Europe news was half-hearted.

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,149
Well, l've had a little time
to think about it now.

94
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,710
And l want you to know that
Europe sounds wonderful.

95
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,758
l can't imagine a more romantic place

96
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,718
or a more appropriate person
with whom to share it.

97
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,711
That's wonderful.

98
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,836
Sam said you'd come around.

99
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,036
Lucky guess.

100
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,234
Dear, may l have
a moment alone with Sam?

101
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,755
Certainly. l'm late
for my session as it is.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,876
Bye-bye, Sam.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,116
How l hate you.

104
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,509
l'd love to smack that smug look
off your face.

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,033
You're pretending not to care
because you believe

106
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,432
that Europe will be the death-knell for
my relationship with Frasier Crane.

107
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,636
Either because l won't go at all

108
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,715
or because the stress of travelling
together for six months will break us up.

109
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,917
- Right?
- Listen to me.

110
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,436
l'm sincere about this. l like you two.

111
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,512
And l want to see you both happy.

112
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,518
Thank you, Sam.

113
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,717
After all, just because
us two didn't travel well...

114
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,668
- When did we ever travel?
- Are you kidding me?

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,354
We went through hell together.

116
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,516
Well, it helped that
you knew the language.

117
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,320
What are you looking for?
A sign from God?

118
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,550
Religious belief is based on faith.

119
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,349
l never thought l'd say this, Coach,
but l think l've lost faith.

120
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,114
Listen up.
l have an announcement to make.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,034
Diane here is leaving for Europe
and she's not going to be back ever.

122
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,955
l believe for every drop of rain
that falls a flower grows.

123
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,275
l believe that somewhere
in the darkest night a candle glows.

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,398
You know, Sam, l got to tell you.

125
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,316
l can't see Diane
going off with Doc like that.

126
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,109
l always figured that you and her
would get married, you know?

127
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,033
- Come on, Coach.
- l'm not kidding.

128
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,435
l pictured you moving to a little home in
the country with a rose garden out front

129
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,989
and a nice little room
in the back for me.

130
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,111
Every Sunday night Diane would
make us a fried chicken dinner

131
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,272
and we'd sit on the porch
and listen to the ball game.

132
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,113
l'd bounce your kids on my knee...

133
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,714
God, it was going to be a happy house.

134
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
l guess that's going to be
Frasier's house now.

135
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,670
Well, you can come by any time, Sam.

136
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,916
But call first.

137
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,077
- Let's get out of here. lt's late.
- Time to go for the night.

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,196
Good night, guys.

139
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,756
- Later, Sammy.
- See you.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,709
l'm not a sentimental guy, you know.

141
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,678
l'd like you to... have a good safe trip.

142
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,638
You big monkey, don't you ever
be ashamed of your tender side.

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,438
Goodbye, Diane.

144
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,556
Goodbye, Clifford.

145
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,470
Come on, you two. l'm waiting for a kiss.

146
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,317
Well... she is leaving.

147
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,716
Did you see the look on her face?

148
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,551
l was more worried about
the look on your face.

149
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,395
Well, Diane.

150
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,430
l'm not going to pretend that you're
my favourite person in the world.

151
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,556
But now that it's all over...

152
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,831
l guess l wish you a happy life.

153
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,070
Thank you.

154
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,798
And...

155
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,076
l thought l'd do you a favour,

156
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
so l wrote down
a helpful phrase in ltalian.

157
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,633
You carry that with you
wherever you go.

158
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,478
lt means, ''Excuse me, Mr Pharmacist.
Where do you keep the peroxide?''

159
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,636
Meet you at the car, Coach.

160
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,312
- l'm going to miss you.
- l'm going to miss you, too.

161
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,119
Listen. Thank you for coming back.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,434
Will he be OK?

163
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,434
- Well, l hope so.
- Coach, do me a favour.

164
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,319
- Sure.
- Stand by him.

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,196
Come back.

166
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,469
lnstead of standing by him,
why don't you just sort of...

167
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,995
- watch over him?
- Of course.

168
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,196
Bye, sweetheart.

169
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,553
Well.

170
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,953
- We haven't been alone for a long time.
- No.

171
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,919
- Funny how things change, isn't it?
- Yes.

172
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,998
l still remember the first time
l came in here.

173
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,554
What a prissy little snot l was.

174
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,838
Yeah. Who would have thought
it could get worse?

175
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,318
Listen to me.

176
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,473
We both realise that a lot of things
can happen when you leave like this.

177
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,393
Who knows
when we'll see each other again?

178
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,994
- Do me a favour.
- What's that, Sam?

179
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,236
l've been a real jerk to you sometimes.

180
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,233
But l'd appreciate it if,
when you think of me,

181
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,356
you remember me
as a decent person.

182
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,271
Of course.

183
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,193
l'll remember you as Albert Schweitzer.

184
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,075
l'd like that. Thank you.

185
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,750
l'm so glad it's ending this way.

186
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,515
After the wrath and acrimony
of our breakup.

187
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,035
l thought l'd never
see you come in here again.

188
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,994
- Do you know why l came back?
- Sure.

189
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,549
Cos you're a woman and l'm Sammy.

190
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,390
Actually, it was because
l was concerned about you.

191
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,028
Your drinking and your health.

192
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,159
Well...thank you.
Because it did make a difference.

193
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,596
Who would have thought that we'd
ever be standing here as friends?

194
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,753
- We are friends, aren't we?
- Good friends.

195
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,033
Well, l'm off.

196
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,315
Wait.

197
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,313
Let me give my...friend
a goodbye hug.

198
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,596
Come on. Get over here.

199
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,717
What?

200
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,953
This really may be the last time
we see each other.

201
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,477
Well.

202
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,358
Goodbye, pal.

203
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,475
Goodbye, buddy.

204
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,949
Bye, <i>amigo.</i>

205
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,994
Goodbye, <i>mon ami.</i>

206
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,116
Goodbye, <i>compadre.</i>

207
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,799
Well, that's that.

208
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,555
- l'll be off.
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.

209
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,516
You too, Sam.

210
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,196
- Sam?
- Yeah, chum?

211
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,953
l'm going to count to three
and then we'll stop.

212
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,395
You got it.

213
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,959
One.

214
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,838
Two.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,911
Two-and-a-half.

216
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,756
Which leads us to three.

217
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,075
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

218
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,275
l think we just counted to three.

219
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,236
You have a nice safe trip.

220
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,956
Thank you.

221
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,269
How could we have ever
denied ourselves for so long?

222
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,078
Come on.

223
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,118
- Let's go back to my place.
- Come on, Sam.

224
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,271
Let's go back to your place.

225
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,034
We have to make up for
a lot of lost time.

226
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,999
- Sam, wait.
- What?

227
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,548
l knew you couldn't be spontaneous.
l knew you'd over-analyse this.

228
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,676
What is it?

229
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,950
l was just going to say
l almost forgot my purse.

230
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,233
Well, let me get that for you, sweetheart.

231
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,115
- What did you think l was going to say?
- That was it.

232
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,716
- What did you think l was going to say?
- l don't know.

233
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,872
l thought you were going to say,
''ls this just for tonight

234
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,759
''or are we going to
start this whole thing over again?''

235
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,798
- l wasn't going to say that.
- Bless you.

236
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,474
- But now that you've brought it up...
- Damn.

237
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,279
l didn't bring it up,
l was just saying that

238
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,557
as an example
of something we'd never say.

239
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,110
No, Sam, l'm glad you said it.

240
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,634
What exactly is it you have in mind?
ls it a beginning or an ending?

241
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,030
Hello or goodbye?

242
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,990
One night of passion or something
that will last beyond tomorrow?

243
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,152
This conversation
will last beyond tomorrow.

244
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,392
Just a minute ago
we were hot for each other.

245
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,677
l wasn't hot. l was insane.

246
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,958
l was insane.

247
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,272
l was about to abandon the most
brilliant, sensitive man l ever met

248
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,149
for one with the morals of
a rutting sea-elephant...

249
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,871
and the intelligence of lint.

250
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,432
Let's just stop right there before
we start insulting each other.

251
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,637
Good idea, Sam. Goodbye.

252
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,673
Please.

253
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,951
Maybe Frasier can give you

254
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,908
an iron-clad guarantee
of a lifetime of security.

255
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,157
But with me it's a day at a time.

256
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,188
Now if you can live with that...

257
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,713
call.

258
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,830
Last l saw,
you and Diane were here alone.

259
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,355
Did you give her a goodbye boink?

260
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,715
Your language. l haven't heard you
talk like that in a long time.

261
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,351
l know, but this morning
after mass the priest said

262
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,799
that he didn't think that Diane's going to
Bologna constituted a true miracle.

263
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,556
l told him l had witnesses. He said
he wouldn't even take it to the bishop.

264
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,030
To answer your question...

265
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,510
Nothing happened
between me and Diane.

266
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,353
She wanted to, but...you know.

267
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,072
- You OK?
- l'm fine.

268
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,638
Cheers.

269
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,678
No, sorry, Diane's not here.

270
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,310
Oh, you're Diane?
Then you're definitely not here.

271
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,552
No, he's right here. Sam, it's Diane.

272
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,708
l was hoping you'd call.

273
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,077
l'm in a hotel room in London, Sam.

274
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,708
Hold on one second.

275
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,636
Frasier and l are stopping over
on our way to ltaly.

276
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,360
So why are you calling?

277
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,231
Well, l'm calling because l've had
some time to think about last night.

278
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,837
We both had a moment of weakness
and l'm glad we didn't give in to it.

279
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,116
But l hope we're still friends.

280
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,997
l don't think we're friends, Diane.

281
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,315
We failed as lovers. lf we're not friends,
what have we been these past months?

282
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,596
We've been kidding ourselves.

283
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,712
- Goodbye, Diane.
- Wait. Sam?

284
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,788
Nothing. Bye.

285
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,916
Before you hang up here...

286
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,356
They got postcards in Europe?

287
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,033
l'm almost sure of it.

288
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,556
Maybe if you think of it
you can send me one.

289
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,396
Write small. You know how l like to
read in between the lines.

290
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,712
- l'll try.
- That'd be nice.

291
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,996
Thank you, Sam.

292
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,796
Goodbye, Diane.
