1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,992
COACH lN LOVE (PART 1 )

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,998
Last call.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,994
- Will you wake Norm?
- lt's not necessary.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,951
One more and l'm a memory.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,511
- Coming right up.
- How long was l asleep?

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,559
Couple of hours. You dropped off
during Cliff's travelogue.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,191
Lucky you. Any subject
you bring up, he uses as an opening.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,559
At least before he went to Florida
he was boring on a wide range of topics.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,951
- Cool it, he's coming.
- Don't you say anything.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,829
Hey, look at this. He is risen.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,993
He was snoring away for quite
a while there, wasn't he, Carla?

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,154
Well, another day shot.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,835
l'll slip off to the <i>hciend</i>
and close the peepers.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,231
- Good night.
- Later.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,791
lt's not really later in Florida.
lt's a popular misconception.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,953
lt's Eastern Standard Daylight Time
down there, too.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,669
Speaking of time,
it stops still in the Everglades.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,198
They have huge gators. That's what
those familiar with Florida call alligators.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,796
They have huge gators and crocs.
You know what a croc is?

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,793
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,111
The first morning there was crystalline.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,637
As l stepped out of the hydrofoil,
the captain, Billy Bob Dupre,

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,079
asked me not to bring the beach
umbrella. lt got caught in the prop...

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,753
- Hi, l'm here. Better late than never.
- That wouldn't be my choice.

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,071
- Sorry, Sam. Traffic was awful.
- That's OK. What have we got here?

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,189
Just some things...some things
you forgot a few months ago.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,273
To be opened later
privately and very discretely.

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,669
My pants!

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,116
Where did you find them,
in your bedroom?

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,273
A little louder for the people
in the Ukraine who didn't hear.

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,753
There's more. How did you get
along without your Snoopy toothbrush?

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,037
Nice, Sammy.

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,397
Mr Tooth Decay
better watch out now, Sam.

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,558
Four out of five dentists
rate this right at the top.

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,396
l trust you'll return the favour.
l may have left things at your place.

36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,030
- l'm sure l left my beige sweater.
- No problem.

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,351
But you can keep
that hand puppet you loved.

38
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,069
- Hand puppet?
- Yes, Brian the Lion.

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,199
Oh, yeah. Brian the Lion.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,035
You were touched that l gave you
something from my childhood.

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,556
Yes, extremely. l'll give you
five bucks to run out right now.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,075
- You got it.
- No, take this...

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,354
Brian?

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,470
By golly, in this light,
it does look a little bit like Brian.

45
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,711
Brian the Lion, a bar rag?

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,356
You are the most insensitive boob
l have had the misfortune to run across.

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,069
lt wasn't meant to work out
between me and Brian.

48
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,356
l wasn't cut out to be a puppeteer.

49
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,674
That's got to be a tough thing
for a man to admit in public.

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,035
Oh, come on.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,069
Come on, please, Diane.
Don't be mad at me. Please?

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,356
- Well...
- Please?

53
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,230
- l guess l'm overreacting.
- Good, then how about a little kiss?

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,113
- OK.
- And put some tongue in it.

55
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,319
That'll be five bucks for my mad dash.
What was that all about?

56
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,519
Brian the Lion
was my dearest childhood pal.

57
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,037
Then being a grimy bar rag
should be a step up.

58
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,277
lt's a fact the word ''Florida''
comes from Okefenokee lndians

59
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,955
and means ''place where
the old people come to sweat''.

60
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,955
Sam, did you see the lady
there in the green dress?

61
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,237
- l'm going to marry her.
- Marry her?

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,356
l'm going to marry her.

63
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,956
- What's her name?
- l don't know. lt doesn't matter.

64
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,112
lt's what we ltalians
call ''the thunderbolt''.

65
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,319
The same thing happened
when l first laid eyes on my Angela.

66
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,917
- Aren't you jumping the gun a little?
- Honest, l know what l know.

67
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,868
Norm, do you think l should go
and introduce myself?

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,512
l think it's best. lt eliminates
that awkward first meeting at the altar.

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,992
Coach, that is the most romantic thing
l have ever heard in this bar.

70
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,549
- Thank you, Diane.
- Wait.

71
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,350
What about when l invited you
to my nude limbo party?

72
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,513
- Christmas Eve was a bad time for it.
- Maybe so.

73
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,389
Trouble is, you're a little
outnumbered over there.

74
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,553
You need somebody
to run interference with her friend.

75
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,678
You're right.
Sam, would you go with me?

76
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,752
Sam would have been my pick.

77
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,956
Coach, l'm going to be blunt.

78
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,556
Her friend's cute,
but isn't what l'm looking for.

79
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,951
What's that, breakaway clothes?

80
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,875
No, she just looks a little
too tame for me, that's all.

81
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,794
Look at it from my point of view.
l only have so many nights.

82
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,270
l'd trade all of mine for one of yours.

83
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,389
- No, you wouldn't.
- Oh, yes. l'd throw in my left lung, too.

84
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,709
Would you please come with me?

85
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,749
- Boy, the things l do for you, Coach.
- Thank you, Sam.

86
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,992
l haven't done this
in such a long time.

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,596
My hands are sweating.
Thank you, Sam.

88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,878
l'll tell you what you used
to tell me when l was nervous.

89
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,634
- What?
- Blow it and l don't know you.

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,430
l should have written
some of those things down. Let's go.

91
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,395
Good evening. My name's Sam Malone
and this is my friend, Ernie Pantusso.

92
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,869
You can call him Coach.

93
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,750
We were wondering if you ladies
could settle a bet for us.

94
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,832
Are you two sisters?

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,438
My name's lrene Blanchard
and this is my daughter, Sue Blanchard.

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,070
- How are you?
- lt's a pleasure to meet you.

97
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,555
We don't mean to intrude.
Are you waiting for your husbands?

98
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,518
No, neither of us is married.

99
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,513
Well, l'll see what l can do about that.

100
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,800
- Would you care to join us?
- Well, thank you, why not?

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,357
- Are you out on the town?
- No, we dropped by to rob the place.

102
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,308
Everybody do as they say
and nobody will get hurt!

103
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,277
That was a joke.

104
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,673
l really enjoy a sense of humour.
With me it's an absolute must.

105
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,354
ls that a player piano over there?

106
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,074
Coach, that was not a joke.

107
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,472
Well, l like a serious side
to someone, too.

108
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,031
- Yes, that is a player piano.
- Would you like to see it?

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,919
l haven't seen one
since l was a teenager.

110
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,631
- When was that, last summer?
- Mr Pantusso, you're a sly one.

111
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,588
l could think you were trying
to steal my heart.

112
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,513
l'd rather have it given to me.
Come on.

113
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,833
- l'm not going too fast for you, am l?
- No. l'm just waiting for an opening.

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,754
Opening?
You could drive a truck through this one.

115
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,910
Well, here we are... Man, woman.

116
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,517
Cool evening breeze, full moon.
Need l say more?

117
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,753
Only if you want me to know
what you're talking about.

118
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,278
Sorry, that was my cute way
of inviting you to an evening of romance.

119
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,069
Well, that's a very tempting offer, but...

120
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,312
Mother and l
haven't been out for months.

121
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,358
l understand. Just my luck.

122
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,071
lf you change your mind, there'll
be a moonbeam with our name on it.

123
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,676
Ernie wants to take me to dinner
at his favourite restaurant.

124
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,753
You and l have had dinner together
every night this week.

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,958
Very funny book.

126
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,189
Don't wait up.

127
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,796
Sam, this is OK with you, isn't it?

128
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,918
- Sam? ls this OK with you?
- Oh, yeah.

129
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,799
Good night. Don't worry.
l'll have her back by Thursday.

130
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,870
You did say you and Mom
hadn't been out to dinner for months?

131
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,794
Yes, l'm afraid l've been caught in a lie.

132
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,637
You were lying to get out of dating me?

133
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,955
l'm sorry. l was only
trying to let you down easy.

134
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,793
You were trying to let me down easy?

135
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,557
- Mr Malone, you're not my type.
- l'm not your type?

136
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,192
- You're not adding a lot to this chat.
- l'm not adding a lot to this chat!

137
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,992
Really, l'm sorry. What can l say?
The initial attraction just isn't there.

138
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,072
Hey, no problem.
Are you kidding me?

139
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,313
l was just helping out my pal.
You're not my type either.

140
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,675
- No harm done.
- No, none.

141
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,789
There's nothing going on. No magic,
no spark, no reason to continue.

142
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,032
What are you doing tomorrow?

143
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,557
l'm not doing anything tomorrow,
but what does it matter?

144
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,679
- l'm not interested in you.
- Right. We established that.

145
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,035
Thursday? Friday? Saturday?

146
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,873
Hey! l don't want to go out with you!

147
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,597
OK, Norm, so he blew one.
He's not a god.

148
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,791
- He was to me.
- There, there.

149
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,838
My world doesn't make sense any more.

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,195
What went wrong?

151
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,399
Boy, if you ask me,
that girl's got a big problem.

152
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,711
You're right. lt's called good taste.

153
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,031
- There you go.
- That explains it.

154
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,674
lt's the bottom of the ninth with two outs.
The Sox need a miracle here tonight.

155
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,472
- Carla, the Sox are rallying.
- l've sworn off those losers forever.

156
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,234
l am not interested.

157
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,628
l retract everything! Go Sox!

158
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,756
Oh, God!

159
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,310
You know, l don't
ask for much in this life.

160
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,436
Fresh fish.

161
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,273
Ten cents off on laundry detergent.

162
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,399
Volcanic boils all over my ex-husband.

163
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,269
And the Sox in the Series again
before l die.

164
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,113
- You're a good woman.
- Shove it!

165
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,034
Sam, did you remember my sweater?

166
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,634
Your... l'm sorry, l forgot again.

167
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,756
l promise l'll bring it in.

168
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,195
Please. l remind you every night.

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,114
Well, it gives me a chance
to throw it in the machine.

170
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,158
Don't throw it in the washer.

171
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,074
lt's hand spun lamb's wool.
lt'll shrink up to nothing.

172
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,878
lt'll shrink.
l'm glad we had this talk.

173
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,679
l didn't realise that.

174
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,997
Since l have to
part with that sweater,

175
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,795
could you tell me where
l might get one exactly like it?

176
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,748
l bought it in lreland years ago.
lt's one of a kind.

177
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,717
So if a guy spent the morning
visiting department stores,

178
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,031
he'd be wasting his time?

179
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,596
Oh, l'm sorry! l'm sorry.

180
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,149
lt's clean.

181
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,155
Sam, how could you?

182
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,029
Come on now, Diane.
Don't be small about this.

183
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,435
l hate you!

184
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,398
- Don't you want this?
- What in the world is it good for?

185
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,792
Did you see that movie
''The lncredible Shrinking Woman''?

186
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,192
l pray to God it never happens to you,
but you never know.

187
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,074
l think l know somebody who's in love.

188
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,754
Good, buy them a beer, Cliff, so am l.

189
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,275
- l meant you.
- l don't need a beer.

190
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,590
l'm just too happy as it is.

191
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,672
Sorry things with Sue didn't work out.

192
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,152
Don't worry about it.
Who needs that walking Frigidaire?

193
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,274
Just goes to show
love can strike anywhere, anytime.

194
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,956
lt doesn't ask your name
or your age. lt asks...

195
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,873
How big are your bazongas?

196
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,238
The beauty of this
moment was lost on you.

197
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,836
Haven't you realised there
is a difference between

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,993
the Coach's <i>ffire de coeur</i>
and your animal cravings?

199
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,958
Tap your cloven hoof twice for ''yes''.

200
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,275
- Coach, isn't it your night off tonight?
- Yeah.

201
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,079
l'm taking lrene to Melville's for dinner.

202
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,749
lt's expensive up north there.

203
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,595
l've been saving.
This is a very special evening.

204
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,515
lt's wonderful you two found each other.
You radiate such bliss.

205
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,355
You know why?
Because we've so much in common.

206
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,353
We both love music and ltalian food.

207
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,469
She's a widow, l'm a widower.
She's a hairdresser, l've got hair.

208
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,349
And get this,
neither of us have ever been to Utah.

209
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,159
Oh, scary!

210
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,471
Norm, check what
the back of my neck looks like.

211
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,156
Every hair at attention.
Except for that one. Snap to, Mr!

212
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,477
l've only known her for three weeks,
but this is the night.

213
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,313
l'm going to ask her to marry me.

214
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,835
- You're kidding me!
- All right!

215
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,152
You devil!
You've been single for a long time.

216
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,039
- You're sure?
- l'm sure.

217
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,988
You know something?
Even my Angela would have liked her.

218
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,720
- Don't you think?
- l think she would.

219
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,509
l figured, why put it off?
We're not kids any more.

220
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,549
l don't quite know how to ask her,
but anybody have any suggestions?

221
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,473
The only proposal l heard was Nick's.

222
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,029
lt worked, honey. What did he say?

223
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,990
''Carla, l knocked you up, you know
where l live, so l guess l have to.''

224
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,516
Not bad.

225
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,828
Moving on to the higher primates...

226
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,515
Normie, how did
you propose to Vera?

227
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,636
Well, l...

228
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,598
You know something? l don't think l did.

229
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,436
- Could there be a loophole?
- Not if you consummated it.

230
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,559
Egad! Why couldn't we have
had this conversation yesterday?

231
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,999
l've written down a few ideas
and they will have to do.

232
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,197
But, Normie, should
l ask her before we order?

233
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,912
l don't want to ask with something
in my teeth, especially if it's green.

234
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,516
Play it safe.
Drape a napkin over your head.

235
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,391
Not bad.

236
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,233
Hi, Ernie.

237
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,437
Are you ready
for the best dinner of your life?

238
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,674
Ernie, every dinner l have with you
is better than the one before it.

239
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,911
Every Wednesday up at Melville's
the vegetable is spinach.

240
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,277
Spinach is green
and you know what that means.

241
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,910
So please sit down.
l've got a couple of questions.

242
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,151
What l want to say is,
oh, wait a minute...

243
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,390
l got it.

244
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,433
lrene...l'm not a rich man.

245
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,750
l'm not a young man.
l'm not a handsome man.

246
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,230
l'm not a tall man.
l'm not a strong man.

247
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,836
l'm not a talented man.
l'm not a well-travelled man.

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,437
l'm not a smart man.
l'm not a milkman.

249
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,670
l'm not a gingerbread man. l'm...

250
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,195
What are you trying to say?

251
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,796
l don't need a piece of paper
to tell you my feelings.

252
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,111
lrene... Well, maybe l do.

253
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,153
l'm not a rich man.
l'm not a young...

254
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,276
Coach!

255
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,549
Look, lrene,
what l'm trying to say is,

256
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,872
l love you and l want you to marry me,
but l can't find the words.

257
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,838
Ernie, you've said all you need to.

258
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,595
- l'd love to be your wife.
- She said yes!

259
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,515
lt's time for the bartender
to pour some champagne.

260
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,592
- l'm sorry, Sam.
- No, no, Coach.

261
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,798
l got it.

262
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,080
There have been many
celebrations in this bar,

263
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,439
but none as joyous and as inspiring
as what we are experiencing here.

264
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,989
Wasn't it Swinburne who said...

265
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,912
l'll get it!

266
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,116
Guys, l'm the bartender.

267
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,395
Well, hello, Sue.
lrene, it's your daughter.

268
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,274
Well, this is a surprise.

269
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,955
l've been expecting
this call for a long time.

270
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,475
OK, commence begging.

271
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,989
Sam, Sam Malone.

272
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,631
Yeah, she's here.
She wants to talk to you.

273
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,313
Sam, you seem to be working hard
to get a date with a woman

274
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,235
who obviously wouldn't
cross the street to spit in your hair.

275
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,075
Don't worry, she will
when she gets to know me.

276
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,832
- What's wrong, sweetheart?
- l just...

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,471
l can't believe it.
Ernie, l won the lottery!

278
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,712
Two million dollars!

279
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,836
My God! Two million bucks!

280
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,879
- l think l'm a little woozy.
- Sam, get some brandy.

281
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,555
Yeah, make it the good stuff.
She can afford it.

282
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,477
Look, lrene, don't tell me that
was the only ticket you ever bought.

283
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,632
- lt's a deal.
- l knew it! Sam!

284
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,069
l think we ought to have a drink.

285
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,198
- l'm buying!
- l thought of that, too.

286
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,357
l can't believe it. l'm stinking rich!

287
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,035
l'd better tell Vic
we're going to be a little late.

288
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,270
Oh, boy, what a night!

289
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,159
My goodness! How about that, lrene?

290
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,880
- What a night for you.
- Magic!

291
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,793
Two such wonderful developments.

292
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,838
Yes, l won the lottery!

293
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,116
And...

294
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,033
...what was the other thing?

295
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,835
English ( en)
