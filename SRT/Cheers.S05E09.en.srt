00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,305
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,973
Hey, Sam!

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,341
Hey, Woody. Is it all right

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,310
if I hang some Christmas
decorations in here?

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,313
Sure. Boy, is it that time again?

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,316
Wow, Christmas comes earlier
every year, doesn't it?

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,818
I think if you check, Sam,

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,822
it always comes on the 25th of December.

9
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,324
Of course, of course, of course.

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,277
Thank you, Woody, thank you.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,779
Oh, look at that, will ya?

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,663
Nice Rudolph.

13
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,115
I made him myself.

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,116
No kidding?

15
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,118
You know, uh, Rudolph is my favorite guy

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,619
in the Christmas songs.

17
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,004
Yeah.

18
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,756
You know, apparently
then, Woody, you're unaware

19
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:42,258
that the story of Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer

20
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:43,259
is one of the most unrealistic,

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,761
and therefore potentially damaging

22
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,262
in all of children's music.

23
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,264
It gives them a horribly
distorted view of reality.

24
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,767
Yeah, but you gotta admit,
it's easy to whistle.

25
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,268
Look, I'm serious.

26
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:54,938
You know, first the other reindeer tease

27
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,306
and then ostracize him.

28
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,226
And then when his abnormality
proves of service, they use him.

29
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,396
But then do they allow him to play

30
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,397
in their stupid reindeer games?

31
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,398
BOTH: Yes.

32
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,399
Oh, no, no, no,

33
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,901
I know how the song goes.

34
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,902
In fact,

35
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,904
not only do Donner, Blitzen, et al,

36
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,907
not love him and laugh out with glee,

37
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,292
but they doubly despise the
bulbous-nosed little wimp.

38
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,329
Well, I gotta be off.

39
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,713
(cheerful): Happy Holidays!

I beg your pardon.

00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,919
This is an absolutely authentic example

59
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,921
of feminine colonial headwear.

60
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,423
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,425
Thou lookest ridiculous.

62
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,431
Hey, Miss Chambers, what's
the pilgrim get-up for?

63
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,316
Oh, I was hoping somebody might ask.

64
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,269
We're gonna have to talk later, Woody.

65
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,273
My graduate American Literature
professor, Doctor Narsutis,

66
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,277
annually recreates the first
Thanksgiving dinner at his home.

67
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,780
He only invites two or
three favored students

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,284
to break bread with his
family and other honored guests

69
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,286
such as William Styron.

70
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,288
And guess who's going to be there?

71
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,291
William Styron?

72
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,294
Yes, Woody.

73
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,795
Ah, heck, anybody coulda got it

74
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,297
if they'd really been listening.

75
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,801
What a wonderful
opportunity for you, Diane.

76
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,270
You know, perhaps in the evening

77
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,272
you can establish a
rapport with Mr. Styron

78
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:43,773
while passing the yams.

79
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,775
Who knows? Come pie time,

80
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,277
he may well have taken
you under his wing

81
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,779
and launched you into
the literary galaxy.

82
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,782
Frasier, you and I are of like mind.

83
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,784
Except one of us is kidding.

84
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,327
Sam, I had thought we would
spend the holidays together,

85
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,829
but when you made no
move in that direction,

86
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,831
I made these alternate plans.

87
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,833
I hope it won't spoil your holiday.

88
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,336
Thank you. No, I, I
have, I have other plans.

89
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,339
Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.

90
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,840
And in all fairness, I will understand

91
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,342
if you get an escort for the day.

92
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,844
It really wouldn't hurt my
feelings in the slightest.

93
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,729
Good. Good, good,

94
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,981
'cause I already have a date with Wendy.

95
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:27,483
How could you?

96
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:30,486
Now you just said that
it was okay, didn't you?

97
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,989
Yes.

98
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,993
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,494
It's fine.

100
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,495
Enjoy.

101
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:40,496
Thank you.

102
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,998
Besides, I know that

103
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,500
we'll have many holidays together

104
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,502
when you and I are one.

105
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,005
You already are one, Diane.

106
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:55,011
So, what's everybody else doing?

107
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,380
Oh, the holidays just
kind of snuck up...

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,214
NORM: My
mother-in-law...

109
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,717
Yeah, that sounds like fun, too.

110
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,470
Well, I'm on my own this year.

111
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,972
Kids aren't with ya?

112
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,358
Nah. They're in Atlantic City with Nick.

113
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,861
Yeah, this is my first
Thanksgiving away from home.

114
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,364
I mean, unless you count last year.

115
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,868
Wait a second. Listen to you.

116
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,370
Carla, you have a new place.

117
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,871
You could have a little gathering.

118
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:22,872
Forget it.

119
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,874
Oh, come on.

120
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,376
What could be more enjoyable

121
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,878
than opening your heart
with holiday cheer?

122
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,381
Opening yours with a can opener?

123
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,884
That sounds great!

124
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,387
No, I meant the first
part, Miss Chambers.

125
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:40,390
Well, why not?

126
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,893
But it's gonna have to be potluck.

127
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,895
Sammy, why don't you bring
your date and join us?

128
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:46,896
All right.

129
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,399
Tell you what, Carla.
I'm good for dessert.

130
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,267
So I've been told.

131
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,519
You know, I'm glad to see

132
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,521
that you're all fending
off the holiday blues.

133
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,025
This time of year is
filled with arguments,

134
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,526
suicides, murders.

135
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,030
Yeah, I guess it's the seasonal
happiness of others tends

136
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,531
to throw a glaring light on the flaws

137
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,033
in our own interpersonal relationships.

138
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,534
But see, of course,
that's no problem for me.

139
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm alone.

140
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,123
Wanna join us for some bird, Frasier?

141
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,592
Could I?

142
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,097
Sure. The more the merrier.

143
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:23,850
Hey, so, uh, what time do
you want us there, Carla?

144
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,135
What do you mean "us," Clavin?

145
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,136
Well, you know...

146
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,137
This party

147
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,023
is for lonelies, not homelies.

148
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,527
Besides, you'll be with your mother.

149
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,028
No, no, not this year.

150
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,530
Uh, she's goin' down

151
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,031
and ladle out some cream of something

152
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,783
to the folks down at the Rescue Mission.

153
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,568
Yeah. Oh, how sweet.

154
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,569
Why don't you join her?

155
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,570
Are you kiddin'?

156
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,072
I did my part this year.

157
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,574
I was in "Hands Across
America," remember?

158
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,960
Oh. Okay.

159
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,961
All right.

160
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,463
Norm, how about you and Vera?

161
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:54,464
Yeah?

162
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,465
No, I can't make it this year.

163
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,333
Why not? I mean, we never even met Vera.

164
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,134
CARLA: Yeah.

165
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,635
No, we gotta go to Vera's mother's.

166
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,637
Such a drag.

167
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:05,057
No beer, no TV, heat turned up to 80.

168
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,560
CLIFF: That's all
right, Normie, you know.

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,431
You gotta do what your
little wifey wants you to do.

170
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,816
You either got 'em or you don't.

171
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:14,817
All right.

172
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:16,819
You know somethin', Cliff,
you're absolutely right.

173
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,322
Eight years I've been goin'
to that old bat's house.

174
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:20,690
I think Vera owes me one, all right?

175
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,575
I'm gonna march into that house.

176
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,576
I'm just gonna say,

177
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,528
"Vera, this year we're goin'
to Carla's for Thanksgiving.

178
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,029
That's the last I wanna
hear on the subject."

179
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,031
All right! Good for you, Norm.

180
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,534
Okay, Norm's out.

181
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,004
Just count me in, all right? You'll see.

182
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,006
Well, my house, noonish?

183
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:40,009
WOODY: Oh, this is gonna
be the greatest, huh?

184
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,511
SAM: All right.

185
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,512
Well, I'm so relieved.

186
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,013
Now I don't have to worry

187
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,015
about my poor little
Thanksgiving orphans

188
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:50,019
whilst I sup with the literati.

189
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,021
Boy, you know, I don't
know who's luckier.

190
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,474
You, 'cause you get to
go to that great party,

191
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,361
or us 'cause you get to
go to that great party.

192
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,653
Taken down at the 40.

193
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,406
And there's the gun
ending the first half.

194
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,708
Yeah, this is just like bein' back home.

195
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,710
Yeah, hey, uh, Carla, look, I, uh,

196
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,712
I really wanna tell ya
how much I appreciate

197
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,214
you, uh, invitin' me over here.

198
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,582
Don't mention it.

199
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,217
I, uh, really appreciate it.

200
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,002
No, I mean, don't ever mention

201
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,389
to anyone that I let you in this house.

202
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,559
May I change the channel

203
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,561
or are you guys watching
this halftime salute

204
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,562
to our fabulous universe?

205
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,563
No, go ahead.

206
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:34,981
Oh, the parade.

207
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,517
And who's this flying our way?

208
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,402
None other than a 60-foot Mighty Mouse.

209
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:43,356
All right, Mighty Mouse!

210
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,357
(doorbell rings)

211
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,241
I'll get it.

212
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,245
Afternoon, everybody.

213
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:52,248
ALL: Norm!

214
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,749
Where's Vera?

215
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:56,752
She's, uh, she's gonna put
on a little more makeup.

216
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:59,622
That, uh, first coat didn't really take.

217
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,460
She is comin', isn't she?

218
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,796
Well, uh, maybe.

219
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,764
Well, what're you sayin' there, Normie?

220
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:11,217
We had the worst fight of our marriage.

221
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,687
Oh, it's tough.

222
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,188
She knew how much this meant to me

223
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,190
and she still insisted
on goin' to her mother's.

224
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,694
So I told her, "Look,
I'm goin' to Carla's.

225
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,195
"You wanna meet me there, fine.

226
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,697
"If you want to go to your mother's,

227
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,065
you can just stay there."

228
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,817
CLIFF: Brutal.

229
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,292
Well, you know, Norm,

230
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,294
I don't think you should worry about it.

231
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,546
She'll probably come to
her senses and show up.

232
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,382
The important thing is that
you're here with us now.

233
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,885
This is gonna be the
best Thanksgiving ever.

234
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,386
All right, Woody.

235
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,506
You know, I brought
that turkey and, uh...

236
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,262
Mr. P., that turkey
seems kinda big and raw.

237
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,147
You think it's gonna be
ready in time for dinner?

238
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:02,018
Well, I had planned on just a
bit more cookin' time, Woods,

239
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,904
but, uh, traffic on I-93
was bumper-to-bumper.

240
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,272
I-93? I took the side streets.

241
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,157
I got here in 35 minutes, buddy.

242
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:08,908
You didn't take Mass Avenue all the way?

243
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,409
I took Commonwealth.

244
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,828
(all talking)

245
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,830
I need the quickest way to
get to the kitchen right now.

246
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,332
Oh, yeah, come on.

247
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,333
I'll show you where everything is.

248
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,044
Oh, hey, no waitin'
around for my contribution.

249
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,046
Here ya go.

250
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,047
Popcorn balls!

251
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,548
Chow down, hear?

252
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,050
Hey, aren't these what you brought

253
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,051
to the Halloween party?

254
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,053
Well, yeah, they're a
perennial favorite, Woodman.

255
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,054
Yeah, but aren't these the ones

256
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,555
you brought to the Halloween party?

257
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,524
(doorbell rings)

258
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,279
Hi.

259
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,948
Oh, hi, Sammy. I thought
maybe you were Vera.

260
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,150
Boy, I can't wait to meet her.

261
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,568
FRASIER: Sammy, yo!

262
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,571
Hey, Sammy! Hey, Sam.

263
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,572
So, uh, where's your date?

264
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,075
Oh. Well, there's a change of plans.

265
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,576
Her sister showed up from out of town

266
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,580
and they didn't like my idea,
so what the hell, you know?

267
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,084
Hey, guys.

268
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,086
Hey, yeah, watch the parade.

269
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,009
You know, the important thing
is that you're here now, huh?

270
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,010
We're all here.

271
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,512
This is gonna be the greatest.

272
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,513
Yeah. Who needs family?

273
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,514
You know, Woody, you're right.

274
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,015
Family is not necessarily

275
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,517
limited to blood relations.

276
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,518
That's right.

277
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,019
Uh, this is much better
than, uh, hangin' around

278
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,021
with a bunch of dingbat
cousins all day long

279
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,523
that you don't get to
see but once a year, huh?

280
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,525
Yeah, or waiting for some
duddy old aunt to show up

281
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,577
(doorbell rings) and spoil all your fun.

282
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,445
Gobble, gobble!

283
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,920
(doorbell rings)

284
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,707
Come on, open the door.

285
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
No, no...

286
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,209
It's Thanksgiving, Carla.

287
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711
Oh! Okay...

288
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,713
maybe she'll choke on a drumstick.

289
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
Yeah.

290
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,600
Thank you, Carla.

291
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,518
Hello, everyone.

292
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,020
Hi, Miss Chambers.

293
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,022
Hey, uh, Diane.

294
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,025
Ooh, Carla, I like what
you've done with the place.

295
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,393
What do you want?

296
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,731
Well, I decided that I'd
rather be among friends

297
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,733
than with my stuffy old professor.

298
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

299
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,240
What happened?

300
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
Oh... Come on.

301
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm afraid my golden
afternoon turned to dross.

302
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,464
I thought it was clouding up.

303
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,468
The moment I arrived at
the home of my professor,

304
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:37,473
I was greeted by a man with a
clipboard who handed me a tray

305
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,842
and told me to serve a
daiquiri to Ms. Radziwill.

306
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,093
Oh...

307
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,313
We students were
invited as domestic help.

308
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:45,648
(Carla giggles)

309
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:53,155
That might be all right when
you're a wide-eyed 19-year-old,

310
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:56,025
but it's certainly not all
right when you're... not.

311
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:59,862
We're all... we're very sorry, Diane.

312
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,831
Thank you, Sam.

313
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:02,832
Yeah.

314
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:05,334
Well, at least you told
that pinhead off, didn't ya?

315
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,838
Oh, I dropped the
tray, burst into tears,

316
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:12,708
took a moment to freshen
up my mascara, and fled.

317
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,461
The important thing is
you're here now, huh?

318
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,962
This is gonna be great.

319
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,465
Would somebody put a gag on Andy Hardy?

320
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,467
You know, Diane, if I were you,

321
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,468
I'd call that guy up

322
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,970
and nail his sheepskin to the wall.

323
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,972
You're absolutely right.

324
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,973
Hey, better yet.

325
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,227
Why don't you go on over
there and tell him in person?

326
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,528
Yeah, good idea. Yeah, that's right.

327
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,531
Hello, Dr. Narsutis?

328
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,032
This is Diane Chambers.

329
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,034
I... yes, the one who fled.

330
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:43,038
Listen, I... I beg your pardon?

331
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:48,544
Well, yes, of course
I accept your apology.

332
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:49,545
He's invited me back.

333
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:52,414
Go, go. Go.

334
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,800
Dr. Narsutis, I'm sorry, I can't.

335
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,168
I'm here with my friends,

336
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,920
my support system,

337
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,222
and there's really no
place I'd rather be.

338
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:04,727
I trust this won't affect my grade?

339
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:05,728
Thank you.

340
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:06,729
Good day, sir.

341
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,648
Turned him down, huh?

342
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,986
Now that I find myself in
the warmth of your company

343
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,487
how could I possibly go?

344
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,989
Take Mass Ave.

345
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,490
I-93.

346
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,492
You holiday hooligans.

347
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,994
Give me a beer.

348
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
So, Sam--
Thanks.

349
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
Where's your date?

350
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
Oh, change of plans.

351
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,369
Her sister showed up.

352
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
Of course she did.

353
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,758
Chortle, chortle.

354
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,210
No, I'm serious.

355
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,712
I had a date and it fell through.

356
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,597
Oh, you don't have to convince me, Sam.

357
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:42,598
I believe you.

358
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:45,601
I'm telling you the truth.

359
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,970
And I love you for it.

360
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,725
How's the turkey doing there, Norm?

361
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,727
I'd say pretty good
for about five minutes.

362
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,111
Oh.

363
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,397
Hey, half-time's over.
The game's back on.

364
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398
Oh, great.

365
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
Oh, you're watching sports?

366
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,818
Hey, don't worry about it, Diane.

367
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,903
Game's almost over.

368
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,288
Oh, I hope so.

369
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:09,625
ANNOUNCER: ...knocked away
and it's incomplete at the 45.

370
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,128
Yeah, I deliver his mail.

371
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:15,631
Isn't this game over yet?

372
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:16,382
Not yet.

373
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,716
Well, their uniforms

374
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,969
are different colors than before.

375
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,253
Uh, well, they gotta change them

376
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,138
every time they score
a touchdown, Diane.

377
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,175
Hey, Normie,

378
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,010
where the hell is that bird?

379
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,895
Cliffy, it's a big turkey.

380
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,013
So are you.

381
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,905
ANNOUNCER: ...with a
tremendous body slam!

382
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:44,193
Now wait a minute!

383
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,694
Diane, Diane, you're absolutely right.

384
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,197
You know, let's turn it
back on the football, guys.

385
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
There you go. No, no, no!

386
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,699
Enough is enough!

387
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,701
I don't think watching television

388
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,703
was the pilgrims' original intent

389
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,705
when they created the holiday.

390
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,706
Well, uh...

391
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,707
No, hey, hey, hey... Hey, come on!

392
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,709
All right, all right,
look, look, look, look,

393
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,212
the turkey's probably almost done.

394
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,713
Let's just adjourn to
the dining room, huh?

395
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,215
All right!

396
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,716
I second that emotion.

397
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
Okay, we'll be sitting

398
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,719
boy-girl,
boy-girl.

399
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,722
Clavin, you can sit anywhere.

400
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,224
Somebody save me a seat.

401
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,226
I got to see a man about a horse.

402
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,728
He doesn't really have to
see a man about a horse.

403
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,236
All right.

404
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,738
Well, what do you say
we, uh, dig into this, uh,

405
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,240
Jell-O surprise here?

406
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,741
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

407
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,742
we're not eating

408
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,244
until the turkey is on the table.

409
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,129
Everybody went to a lot of bother

410
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,380
to make this fine meal.

411
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,882
We're not going to eat it in pieces.

412
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,885
Keep your hands off the food.

413
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,887
Listen, guys, the, uh,

414
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,389
turkey's not exactly brown just yet.

415
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,390
What color is it, then?

416
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,892
Off-white.

417
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,394
(all moan)

418
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,897
But I've reset the timer
and I turned up the gas.

419
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,398
I expect the little pop thing

420
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,399
will be popping out any time now.

421
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,903
Great. Well, I hope it
hurries 'cause I'm starved.

422
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,907
Well, I suggest we take
advantage of the delay

423
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,659
and engage in one of
my family's favorite

424
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,862
little Thanksgiving traditions.

425
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,196
Sam, I know you're
standing in the hallway.

426
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,197
Get in here.

427
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,202
Rats.

428
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,704
In lieu of grace,

429
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,706
we stand up and take turns

430
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,708
toasting that for which we are thankful.

431
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,710
Since you're already standing,
Sam, why don't you begin?

432
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,130
All right, I'm, uh...

433
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,634
I'm thankful that I have a
super car and a cool stereo

434
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,554
and that I'm not dressed
in a pilgrim's outfit.

435
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,555
(chuckling)

436
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,556
I'll drink to that.

437
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,058
You make a mockery of everything.

438
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,309
Oh, well...

439
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,477
Hey, can I go next?

440
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,728
I don't see a line.

441
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,614
(chanting): Woody. Woody. Woody.

442
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,116
(chuckles)

443
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,117
Uh...

444
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,486
I'm thankful that I'm an American.

445
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,954
Hey, all right.

446
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:52,955
I'm thankful for the upbringing

447
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,957
my parents gave me.

448
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:57,459
Uh, I'm thankful for all the friends

449
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,827
I've made in Boston.

450
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,629
And, uh...

451
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,132
I'm thankful that I can do this.

452
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,134
Yo!

453
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,635
Put it away.

454
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:07,503
(chuckling)

455
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,838
Hey, can you guys do this?

456
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,340
Oh!

457
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,343
That makes my thing look kinda stupid.

458
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,844
I can wiggle my ears, watch this.

459
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,229
You guys ever see tongue push-ups?

460
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,564
Look at these ears flapping.

461
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,565
Watch this.

462
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,066
Please, please!

463
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,068
We are not here to be thankful

464
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,572
for strange things we
can do with our bodies.

465
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,994
Norman, you're next.

466
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,413
Well, I'm thankful that
there's a turkey in the kitchen

467
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,914
that needs to be checked.

468
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,416
Yeah. Yeah, get the damn thing out here.

469
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,417
(everyone talking)

470
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,920
All right, I guess I need
to give you an indication

471
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,422
of what I had in mind.

472
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,924
Now I, too, am very
thankful for my health

473
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,426
and for my dear friends.

474
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,928
But on this very special occasion,

475
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,430
my mind goes back over the years

476
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,932
to the people who have influenced me.

477
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,436
And I would like to name
some of them for you.

478
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,937
Teilhard Chardin...

479
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,224
George Sand...

480
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,860
Caravaggio...

481
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,646
Oh, Emily Dickenson...

482
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,031
the Buddha...

483
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,867
Frank Lloyd Wright...

484
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,369
...Jean d'Arc...

485
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,872
Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop.

486
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,877
Uh, guys, uh, listen,

487
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,378
I'm having a slight, uh, problem

488
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:24,880
with the damn bird, all right?

489
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,882
What color is it now, Norman?

490
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,384
Well, I think we're moving
into the earth tones.

491
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,841
This better be good news, Norm.

492
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,843
Look, uh, I'm sorry, guys.

493
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,344
The little pop thing won't pop out.

494
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,846
There's something wrong with it.

495
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,847
There's something wrong with you.

496
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,849
No, no, it's the little pop thing.

497
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,851
Hey, could somebody please explain to me

498
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,853
where the little pop
thing is on the turkey?

499
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,855
I mean, 'cause maybe it's
different in the city,

500
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,356
but in the country where I come from,

501
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,860
turkeys aren't born
with little pop things.

502
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,361
The little pop thing has a name!

503
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,863
It's called a thermometer!

504
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,865
Now can we all please say "thermometer."

505
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,866
(yells): Thermometer!

506
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
Thermometer, yeah!

507
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,869
We can say it till
we're blue in the face.

508
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,371
It's not gonna make
it pop out any faster.

509
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,374
I think something's wrong
with your oven, Carla.

510
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,376
Hey, my oven was just fine

511
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,262
until you stuffed Birdzilla in it.

512
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,015
Come on, you guys, come on.

513
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,018
We don't have to bite each
other's heads off here.

514
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,938
It may be the only thing we
get to eat this day, Sammy.

515
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,476
Hey, you guys, this is Thanksgiving.

516
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,979
And I still say this is
going to be the greatest.

517
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,898
Oh, who the hell do
we think we're kidding?

518
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,399
We're all a bunch of pathetic dropouts.

519
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,236
Scorned by our loved ones,

520
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,737
as if anybody ever loved us at all.

521
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,739
Hey, will you lighten up, man?

522
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
The only thing wrong
here is we're hungry.

523
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,742
Now who else wants
to join me in these...

524
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,212
ice-cold potatoes?

525
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,881
Hey, they'll go great here
with the, uh, Jell-O soup.

526
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,333
I'm dying to try some of the hair

527
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,253
growing on the crudités.

528
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
Well, pass me my peas.

529
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,141
I made them so I know they're okay.

530
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,010
Was that remark, uh, directed
at me, Carla, by any chance?

531
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,513
No, it was directed
at your stupid turkey

532
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,015
and your stupid stuffing
and your stupid gravy.

533
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,517
What's wrong with my gravy?

534
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,818
Oh, nothing, except you could

535
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:12,738
walk across the skin on top of it.

536
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,239
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Julia Child.

537
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,741
Here's your perfect peas.

538
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,743
Oh, look, I spilled one. Sorry.

539
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,747
Thank you.

540
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,668
Norm, I'm sorry about what
I said about your gravy.

541
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:28,170
All right.

542
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,538
It's okay. Fine.

543
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,922
And so are the carrots.

544
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,679
Uh, anybody want some of
these, uh, lovely yams?

545
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,306
Woody, would you care
to test the gravy skin?

546
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
People! People! People!

547
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,063
Stop this immediately!

548
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:06,541
I have never been witness
to such a silly, soph...

549
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,385
Sam Malone...

550
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,253
kiss your butt good-bye!

551
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,638
Food fight!

552
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,641
(yelling)

553
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,152
(yelling)

554
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,362
I knew this was gonna be the greatest.

555
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,863
Huh?

556
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,114
Good bird.

557
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,450
Hey, Diane, may I say

558
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,952
you look saucy in cranberry.

559
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,953
(chuckling)

560
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,955
Laugh while you can, Sam.

561
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,458
Just remember that revenge is a dish

562
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,959
best served cold.

563
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,462
You won't know when and
you won't know where,

564
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,464
but I'm going to get you.

565
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,965
Now that we're done with dinner,

566
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,967
I'd like to make a
toast to our loved ones

567
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,470
who weren't fortunate
enough to be here with us.

568
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,971
Nice thought.

569
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,808
Uh, Mom, Dad...

570
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,359
Uncle Fergie...

571
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,861
My kids.

572
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,362
All right, Vera.

573
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,363
Yeah. Ma.

574
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,365
Coach. ALL: Yeah.

575
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,368
Oh... God bless you all. Very nice.

576
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,873
Well, I think we're
about ready for dessert.

577
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,874
Yeah.

578
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,375
Everybody get enough to eat?

579
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,377
You know, I never had a
chance to try the potatoes.

580
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,378
(doorbell rings) I'll get it.

581
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,380
Oh, well, here, let
me, uh... Oh, thank you.

582
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,381
There you go, man. Sure.

583
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,635
NORM: Vera. You came.

584
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,137
Honey, I'm so happy.

585
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:43,138
Hey, you guys, uh...

586
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,640
Come on, Vera, come on
in, meet all the guys.

587
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,642
This is great. We
finally get to meet Vera.

588
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:49,511
Sam...

589
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,263
think fast!

590
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,653
Everybody, this is, uh, Vera...

591
00:23:58,653 --> 00:23:59,988
VERA: Charming friends, Norm.

592
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:00,989
Get your coat.

593
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,491
NORM: Yes, dear.
