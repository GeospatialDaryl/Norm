00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,900
    Cheers <i>is filmed before</i>     
     <i>a live studio audience.</i>    

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Sorry, Sam.                     

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
I can't fix                     
the jukebox here.               

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,400
Got to take it back to          
the shop and open her up.       

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,300
I'll go get the guys.           

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,300
Take it back to the shop,       
            my foot.            

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
    That's the biggest ploy     
  in the fix-it racket, Sammy.  

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,600
  You know they tell you that   

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,200
    just so they can jack up    
  the price on you. Trust me.   

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,700
      All this baby needs       
     is one swift, good...      

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,700
(thuds, rattles, clanks, clangs)

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
        Shop time.              

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
      (theme song begins)       

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,300
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,500
 Takes everything you've got  

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,100
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,600
 Sure would help a lot         

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,500
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,000
   Sometimes you want to go    

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,500
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,400
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,700
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,300
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,600
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
   People are all the same     

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,600
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,100
Well, what are we gonna do      
      without our jukebox?      

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,200
                 The place won't
                    be the same.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,900
No jukebox?                     
I feel naked.                   

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Excuse me.                      

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,500
  Why are you all mourning the  
temporary loss of this jukebox? 

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,300
I mean, you never play it.      

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,400
No, no, no, Fras, the point is, 

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
    it's the perfect height     
          to lean on.           

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
  Take a look at what it does   
 to the line of my body there.  

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
Perfect pick-up pose, man.      

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
              Hi.               

40
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,100
Oh, no, I'm sorry.              

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm just demonstrating.         

42
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,800
    I'll talk to you later.     

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,100
        All right, Sam.         

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
     But you never play it.     

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
                Frasier, I never
            play Vera either,   

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
    but I'd miss her if a couple
    guys wheeled her out of here

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
        on a refrigerator dolly.

48
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,200
Sam, I should have her back     
in a week, good as new.         
                         A week?

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
         How can we live without
            our juke for a week?

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
             Now, don't you have
          a loaner or something?

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm all out                     
of jukeboxes.                   

52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
How about                       
a cigarette machine?            

53
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Naw, we'd never use that.       

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,500
You never use the jukebox!      

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,700
Hey, if you want, I could       
loan you a karaoke machine.     

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
    What's a karaoke machine?   

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,100
                          CLIFF:
                         Walter.

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,900
    May I?                      

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
              You see, a karaoke

60
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,500
machine is a self-contained,    
uh, musical gizmo               

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,000
of Oriental origin,             
much like yourself.             

62
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,200
You know, it plays the, uh,     

63
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,100
well, the background            
accompaniment to popular songs  

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,600
so that shower crooners         
like myself can sing along.     

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,200
          Oh, Clavin,           
  I didn't know you did that.   

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
          I'm amazed.           

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,000
    That I sing?                

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,600
      No, that you shower.      

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,700
          By the way,           
your singing stinks, too.       

70
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,100
REBECCA:                        
Hey, you guys.                  

71
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,700
     Look what it says here     
 on my limerick-a-day calendar. 

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,300
                     Ohh, let me
                          guess.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
     "There was an old maid     
          named Becks           

74
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,100
      who went a long time      
         without sex."          

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Carla, why does your humor      

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,100
      always have to be at      
    someone else's expense?     

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,200
  That's what makes me laugh.   

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
     Well, for those of you     
          who do care,          

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,400
            Robin gets out of   
            prison on Monday.   

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Oh...                           

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,900
well, that's great, great.      

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
     But aren't you kind of     
forgetting something important? 

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,300
                     No, no, no.
                 No, I remember,

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,300
                 I r... we won't
                 have any money.

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
                We'll have to   
                 start all over.

86
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
        No, no, no, no,         

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
the limerick, read the limerick.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,100
    I cannot believe you guys   
             are more interested

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
            in some stupid rhyme
        than in my happiness.   

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, it's certainly not true   
in my case, Ms. Howe.           

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,300
         Well, thank you, Woody.

92
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm interested                  
in both equally.                

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,900
                    Boy, she saw
            right through me.   

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
            I'm dying to hear   
                  that limerick.

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,100
    Here we go, Sam--           

96
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,900
the karaoke machine             
and some song                   

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
catalogs to go                  
along with it.                  

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,700
        Oh, great.              

99
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,100
      Just what we need--       

100
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
        a loud, abrasive        
     noise-making machine.      

101
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
                  Fras, come on,
         don't pick on something

102
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,400
    that can't defend itself.   

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,000
    Thank you, Norm.            

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Well, perhaps I passed judgment 
    too quickly here.           

105
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
This may have some merit in it. 

106
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
It's filled with old standards. 

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,800
         It's got, uh,          
  "Someone to Watch Over Me,"   

108
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,700
          "All of Me,"          
    "You Made Me Love You."     

109
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,800
         (music plays)          

110
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,300
      Lollipop, lollipop,      
    oh, lolli-lolli-lolli      

111
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,500
 Lollipop, lollipop, oh,       
 lolli-lolli-lolli, lollipop   

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
             (pops)             

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
       Bah-dum-dum-dum         

114
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
      Lollipop, lollipop       

115
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,400
     Oh, lolli-lolli-lolli,    
        lollipop               

116
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
    Normie, Normie, how does,   
         how does this song end?

117
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
I don't know.                   
I think it just kind of         

118
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
keeps going till                
one of us drops.                

119
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,100
       Bah-dum-dum-dum         

120
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,500
 Lollipop, lollipop, oh,       
 lolli-lolli-lolli, lollipop   

121
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,300
                     Oh, please!

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,700
 Lolli-lolli-lolli             

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
     This is the silliest,      
        dopiest display         

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,900
        we've ever witnessed.   

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,700
 And if you want to make a pop, 
      you do it like this.      

126
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,500
             (pops)             

127
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,200
      I've got a delivery       
    for a Ms. Rebecca Howe?     

128
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
    I'm Rebecca Howe.           

129
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,400
          Here you go.          

130
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,300
        And here you go.        

131
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,800
      Oh, a shiny quarter.      

132
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,100
      Jeepers, this'll pay      
for my sister's operation.      

133
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,800
         Look at this.          

134
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
      A single white rose.      

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I wonder what this means.       

136
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,600
      Well, if it means the same
     thing it does in my family,

137
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,200
        you'd better have Clavin
         start your car tonight.

138
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
        It's from Robin.        

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,100
         "Dear Rebecca,         
    I'll be free on Monday.     

140
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,500
    "If you're free as well,    

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,300
would you care to join me       
      in holy matrimony?"       

142
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,900
          Oh, my God.           

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,700
      This is a proposal!       

144
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,400
         In three days,         
I'm gonna be Mrs. Robin Colcord.

145
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,700
        Yeah, that is a cause   
      for a special celebration.

146
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,300
                  Woody, I think
            I'll have a beer.   

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,200
Well, congratulations,          
Ms. Howe.                       

148
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,200
I mean, gosh, you know          
I may not be                    

149
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,200
the most inarticulate guy       
in the world, but...            

150
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,000
                     Wait, wait,
                        wait,   

151
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,600
don't you mean articulate?      

152
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,400
Well, isn't it                  
the same thing                  

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
like flammable                  
and inflammable?                

154
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,700
Boy, I learned that one         
the hard way.                   

155
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
 Honey, I think this is great.  

156
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,900
There's something               
you ought to know               

157
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
before                          
you get married.                
                What is that?   

158
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
I have this strict policy       

159
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,500
about going to bed              
with married women.             

160
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,300
So this weekend is              
your absolute last chance       

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,300
to have me again.               

162
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,500
          I don't think so, Sam.

163
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,700
All right. All right.           
Stupid policy.                  

164
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,100
Uh, how about the weekend       
after that?                     

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
            No.                 
Come on.                        

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,300
Lilith, I can't believe         
you did this.                   

167
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
Nobody's ever thrown a party    
like this for me before.        

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
         Turnabout is fair play.

169
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,400
    You gave me my bridal shower
                three years ago.

170
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,800
Oh, yeah, but Lilith,           
I just threw that together.     

171
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,000
I really didn't put any thought 
into it at all.                 

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,600
              That would explain
                     the napkins

173
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,600
          that said, "Mazel tov,
        Si and Effie Kupperman."

174
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,600
I got a break                   
on those                        

175
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,100
when Si Kupperman skipped town  
with his secretary.             

176
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,900
            How lucky for me.   

177
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,900
Boy, these Mylar balloons       
      are a public hazard.      

178
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,700
What do you mean?               

179
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,800
        Well, Mylar is a form   
                 of metal, Paul,

180
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,800
              and if you release
                    these things

181
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
              they get caught up
      in the high-tension wires;

182
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,500
              they cause an arc,

183
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,500
      sending a shower of sparks
             all over the place,

184
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,500
         and it... hey, it could
              put out the lights

185
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
          of a whole city block.

186
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,900
        All right.              

187
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,200
                        FRASIER:
                      Gentlemen.

188
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
     If I may, I would like     
    to propose a toast          

189
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
to the woman of the hour,       

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
 the reason we're all gathered  
 here at this wonderful party.  

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,800
    To a very special lady,     
        who, I must say,        

192
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,100
    has a glow tonight          
  like I've never seen before.  

193
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
      Thank you, Frasier.       

194
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,200
         Oh, pipe down.         

195
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
  I've gotta finish this toast  
        to Lilith               

196
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
    or she'll kill me.          

197
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,900
        To Lilith.              

198
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,100
                I'd just like   
                  to say, it's a

199
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,300
        really beautiful day.   

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,900
            And this is a really
            nice party and...   

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
            if I'm ever lucky   
        enough to be married,   

202
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
          I hope it's to someone
                  just like you.

203
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
                      To Lilith.

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
This is more attention          

205
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
than I got                      
at my own shower.               

206
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
Well I'd like to make a toast   
to the bride-to-be.             

207
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,600
                    Mmm?        
      Yep.                      

208
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,300
     Uh...                      

209
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,900
I'd just like to say            
that, uh, you know,             

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
when, when you and Robin        
first got together,             

211
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
none of us thought              
that a match                    

212
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,000
between a billionaire           
tycoon and a, you...            

213
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,800
...you know,                    
would work out.                 

214
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,500
But, uh, this is                
just great, honey.              

215
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,700
I, I wish the two               
of you, uh,                     

216
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,500
happiness forever               
and ever.                       

217
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,700
                     That's very
                     sweet, Sam.

218
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
                         Hey.   
            Hey.                

219
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,900
              And I want to make
                a toast, too.   

220
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
                     To you, and
                    all you guys

221
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,300
in the bar,                     

222
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,500
         you really stood by me,
             and I love you all.

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
                          To us.
                  Oh, thank you.

224
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,800
She didn't mention              
my name.                        

225
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,700
         Wait a minute.         
         Wait a minute.         

226
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
I'd like to make another toast. 

227
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,800
She's going to bail             
herself out.                    

228
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,600
        To Robin.               
                          Robin.

229
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Strike two.                     

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
            Wait, wait, wait,   
                 wait. One more.

231
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,500
         I feel like I'm leaving
                somebody out.   

232
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,400
Here we go.                     

233
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,300
                To me, and to   
                my happiness.   

234
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay, Frasier.                  
That's it.                      

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,500
Get your coat.                  

236
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,900
                And of course   
                      to Lilith.

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,900
Oh, Rebecca,                    
you didn't have to.             

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,900
Frasier, put your coat down.    

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,900
We're not going anywhere.       

240
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,400
        Okay, everybody,        
  uh, give me your attention.   

241
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,700
            A couple of the guys
            have put together   

242
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,700
     a song for the future      
         Mrs. Colcord.          

243
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
                         Hit it.

244
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,800
    (high-pitched singing):     
      Lollipop, lollipop       

245
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,600
 Oh, lolli-lolli-lolli         

246
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,800
      Lollipop, lollipop,      
    oh, lolli-lolli-lolli      

247
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,900
      Lollipop, lollipop       

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
      Oh, lolli-lolli...       
                      Excuse me.

249
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Paul, shut                      
that thing off.                 

250
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,100
My wife is throwing             
a lovely shower here.           

251
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,200
The least you can do is         
show a little respect.          

252
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,200
  Aw, Fras, we're just giving   
     a gift of music here.      

253
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,200
Some gift.                      

254
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
 And singing with those stupid  
 voices an even stupider song.  

255
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,000
What's, what is that song even  
supposed to mean anyway?        

256
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,700
        Well, it's, uh,         

257
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,900
      it's about this girl      
        and, uh...              

258
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,700
                    Lollipop.   

259
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,300
  All right, if you must sing,  
    why don't you sing          

260
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,800
something a little more         
appropriate to the occasion?    

261
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,100
      Now, look, here's...      
     here's a lovely song:      

262
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
      "Isn't It Romantic?"      

263
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,800
    Yeah, it's kind of slow,    
        isn't it?               

264
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
Yeah, you don't get to make     
any funny noises in it either.  

265
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,100
          Yeah, really.         

266
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,600
                He calls that   
                      a classic.

267
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
            Well, of course     
            it's a classic.     

268
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
        It has a, a rare beauty.

269
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
                It's a...       
Yeah.                           

270
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
      a haunting imagery,       

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
an enchanting                   
melody.                         
              Oh, yeah.         

272
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,300
Excuse me,                      
and it goes, Paul,              

273
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,200
      something like this.      

274
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,200
                               

275
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,200
      Isn't it romantic?      

276
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,500
      Music in the night       

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,600
  A dream that can be heard    

278
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,400
      Isn't it romantic       

279
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:47,200
      Moving shadows paint     
    the oldest magic word      

280
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,000
        (Norm and Cliff         
     singing high-pitched):     
  I hear the breezes playing   

281
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,500
 In the trees above...         

282
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
             You're right, Fras.

283
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
             It is a lovely song
             when sung properly.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,900
                        Killjoy.

285
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,100
            Boy, that's lovely, 
                  isn't it?     

286
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,500
      Yes.                      

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
This is great "champlagne."     

288
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Did you hear me?                
I said "champlagne."            

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,100
      I meant                   
to say "champlagne."            

290
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
    (laughing)                  

291
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,600
  I said it again!              

292
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,900
(snickering)                    

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
                I think maybe   
              you've had enough.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,300
No, no, no, no,                 
I want to make a toast.         

295
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
    Please?                     

296
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
To "champlagne"!                

297
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,000
    (laughs)                    

298
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,700
  No, no, no,                   
  I'm kidding.                  

299
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,700
To my sweet baby, Robin.        

300
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,900
We may not have much,           
but we have each other.         

301
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,500
Then you don't have much.       

302
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Hit me again, Sam.              

303
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
          Oh, no, I think you've
          definitely had enough.

304
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Sam, I'm toasting!              

305
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,400
            You... no, you're   
             toasted plenty.    

306
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,300
     Sam, I'm not               
through toasting.               

307
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,800
  I want to toast love and...   
  I want to toast commitment!   

308
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,400
            And I want to make a
            toast to my whole...

309
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
        (sobbing):              
      stupid, stupid life!      

310
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,700
      Isn't it romantic       

311
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,700
 Merely to be young...         

312
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,500
    Shut up and                 
  leave me alone!               

313
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,000
         Hey, would you         
    cut me some slack?          

314
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,600
  I've had no formal training!  

315
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,900
  (mellow swing music playing)  

316
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
          Hey, there           

317
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,400
              Who?              

318
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,600
      You, with the stars      
         in your eyes          

319
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
        (womanly voice):        
     Are you talking to me?     

320
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,600
     Love never made           
    a fool of you...           

321
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Frasier, it's been two days.    

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
I think it's time you stopped.  

323
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
      In the middle of my salute
              to Adler and Ross?

324
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,400
              I think not.      

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,600
                   Hey, there  

326
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
                  You on that  
                high-flying... 

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,700
 It's a dangerous combination:  

328
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,100
    a karaoke machine           
  and an obsessive personality  

329
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
whose parents used to play      
      Broadway cast albums      

330
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,800
 to drown out their lovemaking. 

331
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
                 Still can't get
            a hold of Miss Howe?

332
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,700
No. It's been busy for hours.   

333
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
    Well, she is getting married
             tomorrow.          

334
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,100
She probably had a lot to do.   

335
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,800
        Maybe... find something 
                to wear.        

336
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes. It's not like              
Si and Effie Kupperman          
left her a wedding gown.        

337
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,900
                (chuckles wryly)

338
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,400
         (imitates cat snarling)

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,300
      She hasn't been here      
      for two whole days.       

340
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,100
                    Do you...   
            do you think I ought
          to go see her, Lilith?

341
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm going to tell you           
what I tell all my patients:    

342
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,900
      "What do <i>you</i> think?"      

343
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
          They pay you for that?

344
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,000
    What do <i>you</i> think?          

345
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,200
 Oh, I don't... I don't think   
        she wants to talk to me.

346
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,700
Wh-Why, why don't you go over   
 and see how she's doing, Carla.

347
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
Yeah, great, I'll do that!      

348
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
      And while I'm there,      

349
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
      you can take my kids      
    to go see <i>Smurfs on Ice.</i>    

350
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,700
                      All right.

351
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,700
                I'll go see her.

352
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,500
     Woody, lock up for me,     
    would you, buddy?           

353
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,800
                 All right.     
            Everybody out!      

354
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
                  Closing up!   

355
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,700
SAM:                            
Woody!                          

356
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,100
            Not now.            
         Closing time.          

357
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,700
             Could you be       
            more specific, Sam? 

358
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
          I'm not a mind reader.

359
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,000
        (knocking)              

360
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,400
            REBECCA:            
    Hold your horsies.          

361
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,500
    (glass clattering)          

362
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,500
          Here I come.          

363
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,500
                    (banging)   
                         Ow! Oh!

364
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,100
                    Oh, well.   

365
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,900
     You're not the pizza boy...

366
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
        but you're cute.        

367
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,900
    SAM:                        
    Ooh!                        

368
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
How do you see                  
anything in here?               

369
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,300
            REBECCA:            
        Oh, let me just         
    open those drapes           

370
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,300
          and let in a          
      little light, okay?       

371
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,200
            (exhaling)          

372
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Why don't I, uh,                
turn on a lamp here, huh?       

373
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
        (switch clicks)         

374
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
        (switch clicks)         

375
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,500
Come on, honey.                 

376
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
        (switch clicks)         

377
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,800
        (switch clicks)         

378
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,100
    Click.                      

379
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
        (switch clicks)         

380
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,400
                 Boy, you're not
                    going to get

381
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,900
                your security   
              deposit back here.

382
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,300
      You drinking again?       

383
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
         Certainly not.         

384
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
        I never stopped.        

385
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,600
    There.                      

386
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
Now I stopped.                  

387
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
    Now I'm drinking again.     

388
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,700
                     So...      

389
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
            You want to talk?   

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Is this about getting married  
        tomorrow?               

391
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,800
     You gettin' cold feet?     

392
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,200
         Certainly not.         

393
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,500
    I am perfectly prepared     
         to marry Robin         

394
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,800
 and spend the rest of my life  
        with him.               

395
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm just not particularly       
     looking forward to it.     

396
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,000
  You know, I don't get that.   

397
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,900
            You know, all you've
         done the last two years

398
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,300
        is talk about getting   
            married to this guy.

399
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah, well,                     
I'll tell you,                  

400
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
it is one thing...              

401
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,500
        to love somebody        
  who's serving time for you.   

402
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,300
    It's another thing          
    serving time with them.     

403
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,300
Sam, I haven't even begun,      
    you know, to taste life.    

404
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,300
I mean, I just discovered       

405
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,600
this drinking thing.            

406
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,200
                Sweetheart...   
                      (chuckles)

407
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,400
                I can understand
                 the temptation.

408
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
          I mean, after all, I'm
         a recovering alcoholic.

409
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,500
    I'm just not ready          
      for commitment yet.       

410
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,400
         Well, doubt's          
part of any relationship.       

411
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,100
      I mean, look at me:       
    I-I was divorced.           

412
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,100
        You know,               
 I drink for a couple of days,  

413
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,300
and <i>you</i> were an alcoholic.      

414
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 I have a little bit of trouble 
      with a relationship,      

415
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
     and <i>you</i> were divorced.     

416
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Do you retain water in the      
 middle of the month, too, Sam? 

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
                  Look, I'm just
             trying to help you.

418
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,400
            I mean, everybody   
                  gets cold feet

419
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,800
              when they're about
                 to get married,

420
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
         but it's a pretty weeny
    reason to start drinking.   

421
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,600
  Why did you start drinking?   

422
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
            I lost my curveball.

423
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,200
I am not drinking               
because I have cold feet.       

424
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,700
I am drinking because           
I don't know if I love Robin.   

425
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,900
                      Oh, wow.  

426
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,000
                    Do you think
                maybe you don't?

427
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know.                   

428
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,500
 I just wish I had a little bit 
more time, you know, to decide. 

429
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
        You don't think         
    there's any chance that     

430
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,900
     that, um, parole board     
    could keep him in prison    

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
  just a little while longer?   

432
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
         Listen, listen, listen.

433
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,500
  If you don't love the guy, why
don't you just back out of this?

434
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
    Oh, I'm supposed to tell    
  the richest man in the world  

435
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,700
that I don't want to marry him? 

436
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
            No, he's not rich   
              anymore, remember?

437
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
         That's right.          

438
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,700
What's his number?              

439
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
            Come on. Come on.   
                      Stop that.

440
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,300
         I'm being serious here.

441
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,700
I am being serious,             
too, Sam.                       

442
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,400
It's just that                  
I can't stop remembering.       

443
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,600
    I can't stop remembering    
        that one time...        

444
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,700
         in my life...          

445
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,700
    it was just so exciting.    

446
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,900
            Oh, boy.            

447
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,000
  I know where this is going.   

448
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
Oh, God, I loved it, Sam.       

449
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
                     Honey...   

450
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,800
It was just so thrilling,       
 and it was magical, you know?  

451
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,600
        I know, I know.         

452
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,200
  And like every single nerve   
     in my body was alive,      

453
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,700
    and I was glowing.          

454
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,500
        God, it was like        
the first time in my life       

455
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,800
 I was one with another being.  

456
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,400
      Once you have that,       
     you just don't forget.     

457
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,800
  I'll never forget the night   
         we made love.          

458
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm talking about when I was ten

459
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,100
      and won first prize       
      in that horse show.       

460
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,200
You know, but that sex deal     
was good with you, too.         

461
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,200
I mean, even having sex with you
     is better than Robin.      

462
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,800
        Even that, huh?         

463
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,900
So that's it...                 
isn't it?                       

464
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,000
  I don't want to marry Robin.  

465
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,900
        (sniffles)              

466
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,800
Well, I guess I won't be needing
         this anymore.          

467
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,600
    Right now...                

468
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,800
      I made my decision.       

469
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,000
    Robin is history.           

470
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,700
             There.             

471
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
            (sighs)             

472
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,200
         It feels good.         

473
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,400
                     All right. 
Yeah.                           

474
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,500
        Let's celebrate.        

475
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,100
                No, no, we don't
                need to do that.

476
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,800
Yeah, you're right.             

477
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
You're right.                   

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
There is a better way           
to celebrate, Sam.              

479
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,700
Drop your pants.                

480
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,100
                     What?      

481
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,600
You heard me, buddy.            

482
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,800
I... want... you.               

483
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,300
                         Oh, no.

484
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,600
Sweet... sweetheart,            
we-we can't do this.            

485
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,800
        Oh, yes, we can, Sam.   

486
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,700
            The train is pulling
            into the station.   

487
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,300
No, no...                       
            All aboard.         

488
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,800
Whoo, whoo.                     

489
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,800
                  I'm sorry, I-I
                  won't do this.

490
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,400
    Why?                        

491
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,200
             Well, first of all,

492
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,800
            you've been drinking
             a little bit and...

493
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,200
        you know, a gentleman   
                      has rules.

494
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,100
         And second, you're kind
         of repulsive right now.

495
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
You can't take it?              

496
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,200
              I'm gonna go home.

497
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,600
No, Sam, Sam, we have all night.

498
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300
      We've got tonight       

499
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,200
     Who needs tomorrow?       

500
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,200
     Let's make it last, babe 

501
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,500
               Let's fi... nd 

502
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,900
                     The way.  

503
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,000
                Sam Malone...   

504
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,500
      I want you to get ready...

505
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,600
     for the most exciting night

506
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,800
             of your life.
