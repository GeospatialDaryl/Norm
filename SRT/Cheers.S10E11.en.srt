00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,503
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,043
Lilith, do we have to do this?

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,546
Frasier, making out a will
is a sensible precaution,

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,448
and one you've been
avoiding for months.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,350
We're seeing the lawyer
this afternoon,

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,486
and we have to get
these questions answered.

7
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,021
Look, darling,

8
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,857
I find this entire will
discussion troubling.

9
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,826
It's not easy to talk
about one's mortality.

10
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,628
Oh, just the
thought of...

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,197
of being apart from you
and-and little Frederick--

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,334
it's... well,
it's-it's just hard.

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,935
So, who gets the wok?

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,772
The wok?!

15
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,374
My God, woman, we're
talking about death here!

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,642
My death, your death,

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,044
the end of everything!

18
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,813
Being lowered into the grave
in a silk-lined casket!

19
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,615
Yes. And?

20
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,617
And it's upsetting

21
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,619
to mammals like me!

22
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,022
Look, Lilith,

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,159
all my life, I've had a
problem talking about death.

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,995
I know it's irrational,
but I can't help feeling

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,164
that if you talk
about it, it'll happen.

26
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,999
Well, Frasier,
it will happen.

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,667
Stop it.

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,302
What, do you think

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,238
if I hadn't mentioned it,
you'd live forever?

30
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,642
Well, now we'll
never know, will we?

31
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,846

Hi, Mr. Krapence.

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,687
PAUL:
Hiya, Woody.

48
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,522
Where's, uh, Norm and Cliff?

49
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,357
I guess they're at work.
I don't know.

50
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,627
You got a cute sense
of humor, Woody. I like that.

51
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,130
Uh, I bet you
Norm and Cliff

52
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,598
are doing something
really fun.

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,001
Those guys never
include me in anything.

54
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,371
What is it about me
that's such a turnoff?

55
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,374
Normally, Paul,

56
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,743
with a setup like
that, I'd go for blood,

57
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,346
but I can tell
you're a little hurt

58
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,315
and a little upset, so
I'm gonna go easy on you.

59
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,617
It's your looks.

60
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,654
What am I, everybody's
punching bag?

61
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,622
Oh, come on, lighten up,
Mr. Krapence.

62
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,558
Hey, you want to hear
a funny joke

63
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,693
that Mr. Clavin told me
the other day?

64
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,861
Sure. What the hell.

65
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,062
All right.

66
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,530
(laughs)
Okay.

67
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,532
What's round,
looks like an owl,

68
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,735
wears glasses
and goofy orange suspenders?

69
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,203
(laughs)

70
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,675
I don't know. What?

71
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,011
Nothing.

72
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,881
Hey, everybody.

73
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,383
Welcome back.

74
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,052
May I inquire as to exactly
where the hell you've been?

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,054
Vera?

76
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,492
You know, I'm sick of the
way you guys treat me.

77
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,093
You waltz off
God knows where,

78
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,728
and you leave me
here with nobody--

79
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,363
and I mean nobody--
to talk to.

80
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,199
Hey, I love you, too, Paul.

81
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,135
He's trying awfully hard
to fit in, huh?

82
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,103
A little too hard
if you ask me.

83
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,039
All he does is sit there
whimpering and whining,

84
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,540
feeling sorry
for himself saying,

85
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,542
"Include me. Include me.
Include me."

86
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,977
You know, that stuff
doesn't work.

87
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,246
Well, it worked
for you, Cliff.

88
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,582
The point is,
it's not going to work twice.

89
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,818
Woody, where's Sam?

90
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,186
Oh, he's in the office,
Miss Howe.

91
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,788
Hey, get your butt out here,
Mister Macho!

92
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,389
We've been going at it
for six months

93
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,425
like a couple of monkeys,
and I'm still not pregnant!

94
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,596
H-Honey, there-there's
an inside voice,

95
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,732
and then there's
an outside voice.

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,867
I think that was your
outside voice, don't you?

97
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,235
You know, guess who came
to visit this morning.

98
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,504
Mr. Charlie.
That's right, my period.

99
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,873
That means....

100
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,975
You'd think they'd have
a little more respect.

101
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,511
Some of us are trying
to drink our beer here.

102
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,314
What, uh, kind of puts you
off your beer, does it?

103
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,283
Well, no, not really.

104
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,385
It'd take a lot
more to do that.

105
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,553
Oh, yeah?

106
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,855
Yeah, well, what, uh...
what-what would it take?

107
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,757
I don't know.

108
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,726
How about a plate
of meatloaf

109
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,128
with an abscess on it?

110
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,298
(laughs)
No.

111
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,835
Uh, and how about a, uh,
bowl full of scabs?

112
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,638
All right.

113
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,741
Well, how about a...?

114
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,378
Oh, my God.

115
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,380
That's disgusting.

116
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,482
Where do you come
up with that stuff?

117
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,150
Hey... yeah.
Yuck.

118
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,989
But it wasn't enough.

119
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,791
According to the books
that I've been reading,

120
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,860
I should definitely
be pregnant by now.

121
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,061
I think maybe we're going

122
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,262
to have to see a
fertility specialist.

123
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,196
A what?

124
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,365
A fertility specialist.

125
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,601
I asked my doctor to recommend
one, and he gave me this card.

126
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,236
No way. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

127
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,537
We-We're not seeing any doctors.

128
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,805
But, Sam,

129
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,540
it's not working.
I think that it's time

130
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,075
that we have
to face the possibility

131
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,410
that there's something wrong
with you.

132
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,847
You...

133
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,849
You know
why we're not conceiving?

134
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,985
You're too mean to me.

135
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,253
No, I'm not mean.

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,754
I'm perfectly nice.

137
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,123
I just think
you're shooting blanks, pal.

138
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,025
See, there you go again.

139
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,427
That's mean.

140
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,562
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. Maybe that is.

141
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,130
Maybe I've been
pushing too hard.

142
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,298
It's just that...

143
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,900
God, I want this baby so bad
that every time

144
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,002
I find out I'm not pregnant,
I just go crazy.

145
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,637
Let's not

146
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,305
talk about it anymore, okay?

147
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,606
Here, just,
take the card,

148
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,709
and if you want to call
the doctor, that's fine.

149
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,811
And if you don't, that's
fine, too. I mean it.

150
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,546
I'm really sorry.

151
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,982
The last thing in the world
I wanted to do was hurt you.

152
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,984
Thank you.

153
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,689
I can't make this call.

154
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,192
Your fingers don't
work, either?

155
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,935
CARLA:
This will get you.

156
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:47,506
How about losing your balance
in a sewage treatment plant?

157
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,313
All right, all right,
all right, here it is.

158
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,281
How about eating food

159
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,317
recovered from an autopsy?

160
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,485
(laughs)

161
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,256
WOODY:
All right, I got one.

162
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,592
How about

163
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,495
someone coming in from the field
who's been working all day,

164
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,630
while you're sitting down
at the dinner table,

165
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,232
and they got no shirt on,

166
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,101
and their chest hair's
all matted down?

167
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,404
(stifled laugh)

168
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,805
(Norm laughs)

169
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,173
That's kind of
unpleasant, Woody,

170
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,541
but it's not
really gross.

171
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,443
Well, that's 'cause
you never met Grandma.

172
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,917
Yeah!
Hey!

173
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,419
CLIFF:
Oh, hey!
All right!

174
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,856
Uh, Wood, you want to put
a head on that, please?

175
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,893
All right, Frasier,

176
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,928
let's move on
to the living will.

177
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,197
Imagine you've been
hideously mangled

178
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,500
and are being kept alive
by a respirator.

179
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,369
Factoring in
the enormous expense,

180
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,304
the uncertainty, the heartbreak,

181
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,740
do you really want
to be kept alive artificially,

182
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,308
or can I pull the plug

183
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,444
when the nurse ducks out
for a cigarette?

184
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,880
By all means,
pull the plug.

185
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,349
Smother me with
the pillow.

186
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,850
Save time, woman.

187
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,719
Why don't you do it
tonight while I'm asleep?!

188
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,489
Well, I guess

189
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,491
I can't talk to him
about anything.

190
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,062
So, where did the two musketeers
go without me today?

191
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,031
Well, we went
hang gliding.

192
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,299
Then we, uh,

193
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,101
had lunch with the Miss
Massachusetts finalists.

194
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,203
And then, we got to
drive a fire truck around

195
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,404
for a couple hours.

196
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,705
It was great.

197
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,109
You're kidding!
Why didn't you ask me along?

198
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,510
Yes, we are
kidding, Paul.

199
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,012
We went to McDonald's.

200
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,280
What?! You went to McDonald's?!

201
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,717
Woody, where's Sam?

202
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,185
"Woody, where's Norm and Cliff?"

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,653
"Woody, where's Sam?"

204
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,188
Now I know
how Mr. Krapence feels.

205
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:47,192
How come no one ever walks in
and asks me where I am?

206
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,461
Woody, where are you?

207
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,763
Don't ask me now.

208
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,431
Ask me when I'm not around.

209
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,205
I went to the doctor,
and I had an examination.

210
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,607
Well, what happened?
I don't know yet.

211
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,008
They're gonna call me
with the results.

212
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,910
I want you to know
that no matter what happens,

213
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,078
we're in this together.

214
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,080
There'll be no finger-pointing,
no blaming.

215
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,516
And if there is a problem,
we'll work through it.

216
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,584
Yeah.
Because we both
want the same thing.

217
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,786
Oh, more than anything.

218
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,953
We just want
a little baby.
Yeah.

219
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,021
Oh, God.
Oh.

220
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,289
(phone rings)

221
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,324
You know...
Give me a second.

222
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,392
Hello.

223
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,960
Uh-huh, this is she.

224
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,562
Oh. I just...
Oh, really?

225
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,130
You sure?

226
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,399
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

227
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,068
(sighs)

228
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,202
All right!

229
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,370
It's not me!

230
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,604
It must be you!

231
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,241
You're the one!

232
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,443
Frasier, focus.

233
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,944
If we're going
to make a will,

234
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,447
we have to get
these questions worked out.

235
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,816
I just don't want to
talk about my death.

236
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,818
And-or dismemberment.

237
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,722
You know,

238
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,989
I don't see us lingering

239
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,558
over the question
of your death.

240
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,792
Well, that's because,

241
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,761
statistically-speaking,
I'll outlive you.

242
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,663
Well, I'll just bet you're
looking forward to that--

243
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,631
being the "Widder Crane."

244
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,567
Frasier, really.

245
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,868
You know, first,

246
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,970
you get me to get
this $1 million

247
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,138
life insurance policy.

248
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,007
Now you're badgering
me about the will.

249
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,876
Lilith, I'm practically afraid
to start my car in the morning.

250
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,278
Frasier, I'm a scientist.

251
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,248
If I wanted to kill you,
I could certainly think

252
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,617
of more clever ways to do it
than that.

253
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,819
Something subtle.

254
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,889
Something that couldn't
be traced back to me.

255
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,958
Drink your drink, darling.

256
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,362
You are so cute
when you fear for your life.

257
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,699
You know, Lilith,
all this talk

258
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,301
of wills and dying--

259
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,571
well, I've just never been so
depressed in all my life.

260
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,774
Frasier, everyone dies.

261
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,542
We have to face that.

262
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,177
I'm going to die, too.

263
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,246
Again?

264
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,217
Some people are just
a bunch of babies

265
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,552
about making out a will.

266
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,720
Think so?

267
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,221
Yeah. Oh, sure,
I think so.

268
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,457
I mean, as far
as I'm concerned, it's a...

269
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,492
it's-it's your duty
as a mature adult.

270
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,761
You got to prepare
for the inevitable there now.

271
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,896
So you took care of it, huh?

272
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,531
Oh, yeah, yeah, you bet.

273
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,666
Anything happens to me,
everything goes to Ma.

274
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,435
What happens if Ma goes first?

275
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,903
Shut up!

276
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,638
Shut up, Peterson!

277
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,873
Shut up,
the whole sick bunch of you!

278
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,745
Why should I have to go
to a fertility doctor?

279
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,880
And I don't want to go
to a fertility doctor.

280
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,716
Sammy.

281
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,284
I hate going
to doctors,

282
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,920
especially fertility
doctors.

283
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,356
Sammy, why don't
you just go?

284
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,225
Why should I?

285
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,594
The whole idea that I have
a problem is just ridiculous.

286
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,162
Oh, yeah?

287
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,200
You've been with thousands
of women over the years, right?

288
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,601
Yeah. Right.

289
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,171
Well, how many cards do you get
on Father's Day?

290
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,244
Well, you know...
that doesn't mean anything.

291
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,314
Sammy, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to face

292
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,117
the possibility that,
whether you like it or not,

293
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,321
you might just possibly
have a low sperm count.

294
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,523
You're fired.
Get out of here.

295
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,924
Go on-- right now.
You're fired.

296
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,126
Don't turn on me.

297
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,327
I'm not the one
with the problem.

298
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,263
I do not have a problem!

299
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,565
I have just as much firepower
as the next guy, I'll tell you.

300
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,268
You think I'm afraid to go
to that doctor, don't you?

301
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,803
Well, watch this.

302
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,072
I'm gonna go to that
stupid fertility doctor.

303
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,109
You know, I bet my fertility
just soars right off the map.

304
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,580
I'll bet I break
their stupid machine.

305
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,884
Oh, y-you don't think
they use a machine, do you?

306
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,275
Can I help you?

307
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,716
Do you have
an appointment?

308
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,351
No. No. Uh...

309
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,852
I was just, uh, in the building.

310
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,787
I thought I'd stop by
and say hi.

311
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,923
Hi.

312
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,358
(chuckles)

313
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:16,962
Actually, I-I'm here
for a cleaning.

314
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,365
This is a fertility clinic.

315
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,601
What, precisely,
would you like us to clean?

316
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,872
Oh, this...
this is embarrassing.

317
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,476
I'm sorry. I thought this
was a dentist... I-I'm s...

318
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,378
You know something, though,
you know, uh...

319
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,181
While I'm here, you know,
I have-I have this friend

320
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,416
who's got a problem,

321
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,184
and maybe you could do him
a favor,

322
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,452
and-and write him
a note, huh?

323
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,653
Saying what?

324
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,055
Oh, it doesn't really matter.

325
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,891
Just, uh, well you know, uh,
"To whom it may concern..."

326
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,927
uh, "Sam Malone,"
that-that's my friend, uh...

327
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,064
"Sam Malone has a very,
very high sperm count.

328
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,566
Go ahead and have plenty
of sex with him."

329
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,704
Maybe, you know, sign it
down here at the bottom.

330
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,739
If you want to, you know,
put that into, uh,

331
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,975
medical terms, that'd be cool.

332
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,544
I can't do that.

333
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,414
There's 30 bucks in it
for you if you do.

334
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,215
You're Sam Malone, aren't you?

335
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,787
Yeah. How'd you know?

336
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,756
Believe me, this
happens all the time.

337
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:18,957
The doctor has an opening.

338
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,192
Would you like to see him?

339
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,995
Yeah. All right.

340
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,663
Yeah. Whatever.

341
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,735
Listen, uh...

342
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,238
you really don't use
a machine, do you?

343
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,047
Can I help you?

344
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,817
Uh. no, no. I just...

345
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,885
wanted to stop in and say hi.

346
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,426
According to the tests,
the doctor says

347
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,296
that I am as fertile
as an Iowa cornfield.

348
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,400
Fully stocked ovaries,

349
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,304
fallopian tubes
like fire hoses.

350
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,406
How you doing, Norm?
Still drinking.

351
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,678
Hey, what have you got there,
Mr. Clavin?

352
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,846
Uh, cake and a pizza.

353
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,214
I was thinking about

354
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,715
how we keep leaving Paul
out of stuff.

355
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,251
So I thought, why not throw him
a little party.

356
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,887
Oh, what a sweet,
generous thing to do, Cliff.

357
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,689
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, well thanks.

358
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,525
I remember, uh, how lonely
and left out I felt

359
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,594
till you guys threw me
that big party.

360
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,062
We never threw
you a party.

361
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,865
No kidding.

362
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,768
Anyway, Paul's
not here.

363
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,237
Oh, yeah, no, I know.
I, uh, I called him at home,

364
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,272
and I told him to get down here
as soon as he can.

365
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,373
He said he was just
getting out of the tub

366
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,243
and he was toweling
himself off.

367
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,451
We have a winner!

368
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,125
So, you got a, uh,
pizza there, huh?

369
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,794
Yeah. Yeah.
It's pizza.

370
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,029
Yeah. Paul's really
going to enjoy that.

371
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,632
Yeah...
When's he, uh,
supposed to be coming by?

372
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,400
Couple minutes.
Couple minutes.

373
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,802
Couple minutes.

374
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,738
That's, uh,
pepperoni, huh?

375
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,106
You betcha.

376
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,175
Now, did you
mention to Paul

377
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,911
that we had a cake
and a pizza?

378
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,380
No. No, no, I didn't.

379
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,248
So, uh, you know,
we still have the cake.

380
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,050
Uh, I mean, if there
wasn't any pizza,

381
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,053
<i>Paul wouldn't know there wasn't
even gonna be any pizza.</i>

382
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,122
Exactly.

383
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,924
(chuckles)

384
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,265
What kind of cake is it?

385
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,139
It's, uh... angel food.

386
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,741
This is bad.

387
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,377
This is really bad.
Why?

388
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,178
We should take that cake,
put it in the office

389
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,014
where it won't be
such a temptation.

390
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,181
Good idea.
Yeah.

391
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,549
Out of sight,
out of mind, huh?

392
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,891
We're going to eat the cake,
too, aren't we, Norm?

393
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,926
It's gone.

394
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,967
Here.

395
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,270
The will is signed
and witnessed.

396
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,738
I hope you're happy, woman.

397
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,374
I wash my hands of
the entire affair.

398
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,243
I want that
thing sealed up

399
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,544
and put into a
vault until...

400
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:29,915
<i>Until you're sealed
and put in a vault?</i>

401
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,218
I am just your ball
of yarn today, aren't I?

402
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,721
I've also given my
executor the right

403
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,991
to dispose of a few
personal effects--

404
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,893
a few things which
might give solace

405
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,262
to those who
cared about me.

406
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,464
Carla, what would you
like me to leave you?

407
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,200
How about a tip,
for a change?

408
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,005
Hey, Woody, Cliff called me
and told me

409
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,606
that he and Norm wanted
to see me. Where are they?

410
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,208
Oh, they're in
the office.

411
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,010
Say, Woody, how about you?

412
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,244
What can I give you?

413
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:03,549
Oh, well, uh...
you know those sweaters

414
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,184
like that one
with the big leaves on them?

415
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,352
Yes.

416
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,054
Anything but those.

417
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,361
Oh, hi, Paul. How are you?
Hey.

418
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,695
You guys wanted to see me?

419
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,430
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

420
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,165
Yeah, we were
just talking, uh...

421
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,167
We'd like to, you know,
apologize for, you know,

422
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,769
leaving you out of things

423
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,205
and, well, you know,
that kind of stuff.

424
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah. You know,
after all, you've only

425
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,408
been coming here, what,
you know, a few weeks?

426
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,477
Ten years.
I've been coming here ten years.

427
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,978
Whatever. Whatever.

428
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,013
Anyway, uh...

429
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,148
we just feel
like we want to--

430
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,449
oh, thanks, Woody--

431
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,151
just feel like we want
to make it up to you.

432
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,819
What we're going
to do, Paul,

433
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,222
we're going to buy
you a free beer.

434
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,758
Yeah! Woody, right to the brim
for Uncle Paul, huh?

435
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:46,992
There you go.

436
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,827
Wow. I... I can't
believe this,

437
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,195
you know?
Thanks, guys.

438
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,764
It's a really
nice thing to do.

439
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,898
Really made
me feel special.

440
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,800
Don't mention it,
Paul.
Yep.

441
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,937
You guys ate my cake,
didn't you?

442
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,472
Yes, we did, Paul.

443
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,181
You know,

444
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:13,052
writing this will
has forced me

445
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,187
to take a good,
long look at my life--

446
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,523
who I've been,

447
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,059
who I've become.

448
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,529
As I tally up
the ledger of my... my life,

449
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:27,966
I... I come to one
unmistakable conclusion.

450
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,939
I have tipped you adequately.

451
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,680
More, in fact,
than you have deserved.

452
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,115
Frasier,
I called a cab.

453
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,883
Go clean yourself up.

454
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,518
Okay.

455
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,191
You were never courteous.
Never once.

456
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,630
Sammy, what took you so long?

457
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,002
I decided to hang around
and wait for the lab report.

458
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:08,040
When I finally got it,
I was afraid to look at it.

459
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,375
I've been walking
around the Common

460
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,744
hoping someone would
mug me and steal it.

461
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,580
Yeah. Well, those things
are really hot.

462
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,784
I carry a sign in my car:
"Driver has no lab results."

463
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,925
Why don't you go ahead
and look at it?

464
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,627
Might be good news.

465
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,562
Yeah, it might
be bad news.

466
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,164
It might be good news.

467
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,565
But what if it's not?

468
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,501
Well, you're not going to know
unless you open it.

469
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,702
I can't.

470
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,737
You open it.

471
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,306
Oh, I couldn't do that.

472
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,109
I mean, I...I couldn't bear
to tell you if it was bad news.

473
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,344
But what if it's good news?

474
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,880
What if it's bad news?

475
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,517
You know, this
could turn out

476
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,186
to be the worst night
of my life or the best.

477
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,854
And the... the
only difference

478
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,692
is a few lousy words
on a piece of paper.

479
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,894
Oh, God, you know, this
is the rest of my life

480
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,396
we're talking about here.

481
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:09,335
I mean, I-I may have a kid
to play baseball with.

482
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,936
Or I may not.

483
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,439
I may have someone
to carry on my name,

484
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,240
or I may not.

485
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,609
Oh, geez!

486
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,244
Boy, it's amazing, you know,

487
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,014
how much power a little piece
of paper can have.

488
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:23,649
You know, maybe this
is just one of those things

489
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,983
that people should not know.

490
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,488
Sammy?
Yeah?

491
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,156
Give me that
trash can over there.

492
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,293
What are you doing?

493
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,028
Putting you out
of your misery.

494
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,297
It was just a little
too painful to watch.

495
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:42,668
Oh. Hey, thank you.

496
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,403
Oh!

497
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,372
(flames crackling)

498
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,809
Too bad we don't have
any marshmallows, huh?

499
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:51,977
We've got you.

500
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,213
(car horn honking)

501
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,849
Hey, Fras,
your cab's here!

502
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,319
Oh, there.
I've pulled myself together.

503
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:09,194
Now that I have my will,
I suppose I can

504
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:11,330
look into the face of death.

505
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,900
Just hope I don't wake her.

506
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,111
I am sorry about the passing
of your husband, Lilith.

507
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,348
Frasier was a good man,
and we will all miss him.

508
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,749
Thank you.

509
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,719
Well, I now have
the unhappy task

510
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,187
of reading your
late husband's will.

511
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,524
You okay, Mother?

512
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,026
Yes. Thank you,
Frederick.

513
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:45,397
"Sam Malone's sperm count
is well within normal range."

514
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:49,068
That damn bar.
