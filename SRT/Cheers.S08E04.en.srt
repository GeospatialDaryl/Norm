Ah, yes, of course.    
         I never forget a face.

10
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,927
You never know                 
 when a name and a face         
 might be significant in life.

11

There you go.              
     You remember me,           
     cliff clavin?

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,248
Excuse me?

13
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:37,051
Uh, we were wondering, sir,    
 uh, when you were growing up   
 back in england,

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,054
did you get                    
 that american television show  
 called  <i>the millionaire?</i>

15
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,657
Uh, no, i'm sorry,              
i missed that.                  
But we did get some, um,  <i>lucy.</i>

16
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:44,191
<i>Lucy,</i> oh, yeah,               
  now there's a classic.

17
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:47,178
But getting back               
 to this  <i>millionaire</i> show--    
    i loved, um,  <i>bilko.</i>

18
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,364
Oh, yeah,  <i>bilko.</i>

19
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:51,866
"Hey, doberman,                
 get in that jeep!"

20
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,535
Anyway, uh,            
         this  <i>millionaire</i> show

21
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,970
is about a guy                 
 named j. Beresford tipton,     
 tipton.

22
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:59,173
And, uh, he was,        
        uh, you know,           
        an incredibly nice guy.

23
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,809
He had tons of bucks.      
     Yeah.

24
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,276
He used to--                   
 he used to just

25
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:05,496
pick people at random          
 and give 'em                   
 a million dollars!

26
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:08,450
Really?

27
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:10,268
Yeah. Yeah, tax free.      
 Isn't that something?

28
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,702
You know what,         
         you're right.

29
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,471
The thing                  
     that i didn't understand   
     about that show

30
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,140
was he used to give it     
     away to strangers.

31
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,208
Would've made so much       
    more sense to me, you know,

32
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,244
you probably           
         agree with me,         
    absolutely.

33
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,763
If he would've come up     
     to people, and, say,       
     in a bar, you know,

34
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,849
and said, "here you are.       
 Just have one million bucks."  
 That makes sense.

35
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,301
Yes, i can see          
        how that could          
        be very rewarding.

36
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,903
Sure. Sure it would.

37
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:29,888
I'm ready.

38
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:31,206
Oh, i don't    
                 have any cash.

39
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,040
No, no. I got it. Whoa!    
 No, no, no, no.

40
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:35,176
No. Clavin will            
     be buying this one.        
             I got it. No, no.

41
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:37,745

            I got it, i got it.

42
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,980
I've got a job, i'll do it.    
 I'll pay for it.

43
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:42,149
All right, woody,              
 uh, how much                   
 do i owe you there,

44
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,118
for the man's drink?           
                         $75.

45
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,020

what are you       
             watching, carla?

62
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,747
Oh, it's the end               
 of  <i>criminals at large.</i>        
<i> Uh-huh.</i>

63
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,283
Yeah, i've been following      
 this story for weeks.

64
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,185
There's something about it, 
    it's so bizarre.

65
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,687
All of these stories   
         are that way.

66
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,988
Yeah, yeah. But this one's 
     really outrageous, sam.

67
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,091
It's about this woman  
         who meets men,

68
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,360
marries 'em,                
    steals everything they own,

69
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,779
and then kills them.   
        What part               
        don't you understand?

70
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,248
Well, for some reason          
 they want to arrest her.

71
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:28,723
Not feeling at all bitter      
 toward the opposite sex,       
 are you, carla?

72
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,724
No. Why?

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,977
What's with your head?

74
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,547
There was an incident          
 in our lamaze class.

75
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:41,619
What happened?

76
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,655
Suffice it to say       
        that lamaze class

77
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,624
is not the place       
         to flirt.

78
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:52,497
You know,                      
 the most wonderful thing       
 just happened to me

79
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:53,682
on the way over here.

80
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:54,765
(Sam)                          
 and what is that?

81
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,551
I was in a car accident.

82
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,404
Oh, yeah. Nothing like     
     a little broken glass      
     and twisted metal

83
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,973
to put the spring back     
     in your step.

84
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,075
No, this was actually  
         just a fender-bender,

85
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,544
but the bender     
             happens to be      
             a plastic surgeon.

86
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,614
Now, he doesn't want me    
     to report this             
     to the insurance company,

87
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,949
so he said he will give me     
 the plastic surgery procedure

88
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,185
of my choice.      
             Isn't that great?

89
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,703
Woo!

90
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,505
He'll only do one thing?       
                 Uh-huh.

91
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,156
Report the accident.

92
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:24,128
So, uh, ahem, what part 
        are we gonna do?

93
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:26,281
I don't know yet.

94
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:29,417
He gave me this book           
 to look through,               
 and decide what i wanted done.

95
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,720
Oh, miss howe,                 
 i don't think you'd look good  
 with a honker that size.

96
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,757
Woody, that's the before.  
     Here's the after.

97
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:40,028
Well, that is smaller.         
 Now, um,

98
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,130
what do they do                
 with the left-over             
 nose bits?

99
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:44,332
Oh, man!    
         Ah, woody!

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,434
That is just        
            a little bit gross.

101
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:48,002
What?                          
 That's a good question.

102
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,338
I mean, they put pig snouts    
 in liver sausage.

103
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,423
Oh!

104
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,742
They do not.

105
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,259
Read the package.

106
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,514
Hey, cliffie!

107
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:01,816

         hey, my friends.

108
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:04,602
I just got                 
     a very auspicious message  
     on this, uh,

109
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,871
miracle of modern technology.

110
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:09,341
I didn't know they made     
    8-track answering machines.

111
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,894
Yeah. It seems                 
 i got this message             
 from canada

112
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,847
from a certain, uh,            
 miss margaret o'keefe.

113
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,532
Who's margaret o'keefe?

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,469
Oh, she's a young woman     
    with whom cliff had         
    a brief romantic encounter.

115
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,337
If you don't                   
 want to tell me,               
 just say so.

116
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,306
You don't have                 
 to make things up.

117
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,127
I'm not gonna give

     say anything.

127
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,700
Didn't say anything?           
 Not yet.

128
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,587
"Make time, need               
 to see you, bye."

129
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,105
Huh?

130
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,773
Hey, clavin,               
     why don't you wise up?

131
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,442
She's probably just comin' 
     over here to dump you.

132
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,878
Oh, by the way,         
        if i'm in the back room 
        when she comes,

133
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,763
would somebody call me?

134
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,598
Well, you know,         
        uh, carla,

135
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,634
i gave that possibility 
        some consideration.

136
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,302
And i, uh, figured

137
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,138
that if that dame              
 wanted to shove this lug       
 in a dead-letter file,

138
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,790
she would've 86ed me       
     with a postcard            
     and a 2-bit stamp.

139
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,242
Sam, is it me,     
             or is mr. Clavin

140
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,344
starting to sound      
         like raymond chandler?

141
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,363
Ah,  <i>mes amigos,</i>

142
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,398
i know exactly     
             what's going on

143
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,434
in that sexy little        
     egg-shaped head of hers.

144
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,922
She left me,                   
 lo those many months           
 ago, to pursue a career.

145
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:33,892
That wasn't enough, no sirree, 
 she wanted her man back.

146
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,960
Heck, hey, you've seen         
 my bumper sticker:

147
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,729
"letter carriers            
    do it on foot."

148
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,965
Yeah. Yeah, i have 
             seen that one.

149
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,635
I always wondered       
        what the hell it meant.

150
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,137
Uh, i'm not sure. They were    
 giving 'em away free.

151
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,726
So you and her                 
 are getting pretty serious,    
 huh?

152
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:53,144
You betcha.                    
 You betcha.

153
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,747
Well, cliff, that's a--    
     that's a pretty big step.

154
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,549
Outside of margaret,

155
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:00,217
have you ever had          
     a serious relationship?

156
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,319
Or a date?

157
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:04,555
(Cliff) 
                        yep.

158
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:06,724
This one time in high school,  
 wendy beaman.

159
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,477
Wendy beaman.                  
 What happened with wendy?

160
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,445
Uh, i asked her to go steady.  
 She accepted.

161
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:13,848
And, uh, wouldn't you know it, 
 the very next day,

162
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,216
i come down with this, uh,

163
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:17,552
darn pesky              
        little teenage problem.

164
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,787
Oh, your face   
                broke out, huh?

165
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,289
No. Hysterical blindness.

166
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,760
What? What did you say?

167
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,745
From the latin, uh,            
  <i>blindis hystericolis.</i>

168
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,882
Meaning that you couldn't  
     see, or what?

169
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,184
Oh, uh, well, you know,

170
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,353
i couldn't see whenever        
 she was around, but, uh,

171
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,488
once, uh, she wasn't there,    
 i could see fine.

172
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:38,722
Uh, so, uh,

173
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,424
we got into a big argument     
 about it.

174
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:43,961
We broke up                    
 and as soon as she ran         
 crying out of my life, uh,

175
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,929
i could see                    
 clear as a bell.

176
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,699
Cliff.             
                 Yeah.

177
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,518
Would you be interested    
     in taking part             
     in a university project?

178
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:53,621
(Lilith)        
                no, let--let me 
                rephrase that.

179
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,356
Would you be interested 
        in being                
        a university project?

180
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:02,763
Well, i really don't have      
 a lot of time for that now,    
 but thanks for asking.

181
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,668
You know, guys,                
 i've been telling you          
 for a long time now that, uh,

182
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:10,404
like the proud bird 
            on my sleeve,       
            i was a lone eagle.

183
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:12,757
Yeah.

184
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,109
Even an eagle's got to mate    
 once in his life.

185
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,629
Molts in the spring.

186
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,097
Now, you know,

187
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,066
the female lays 
                1 to 3 eggs.

188
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,051
Incubation period's 
            about 35 days.

189
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,919
Cliff!             
 Thank god.

190
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:29,123
Oh, maggie-pants!

191
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,991
Oh, cliff,                     
 i missed you so much.

192
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,593
Oh, i missed you, too.

193
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,463
Oh, turn around,           
     let me have a look at you.

194
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:38,265
Oh, your back bacon    
         is makin' me achin'!

195
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,469
Oh, cliff, i dreamed           
 of hearing you say that.

196
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,122
Oh. Sit down here.

197
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,358
It's so great                  
 to be with you again.

198
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:52,213
I can't tell you               
 how hard these months          
 of separation have been.

199
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,433
The men up in canada,          
 well, they just                
 don't compare to you.

200
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,784
Oh.

201
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,937
They're just pale, pathetic    
 imitations of you, cliff.

202
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,590
Boy, that must be one      
     butt-ugly country.

203
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,912
I finally couldn't             
 stand it anymore,

204
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,514
and i had to come back         
 and--and ask you something.

205
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,751
Well, what?

206
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,936
Oh, no, i can't.               
 This is crazy.

207
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:19,423
Oh, come on, maggie.    
        Well, tell me, tell me. 
        Come on, what is it?

208
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:20,792
Well, cliff,

209
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,960
can i be your girl?

210
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,565
C-can you be my girl?

211
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,434
Oh, no. I shouldn't            
 have been that forward.        
 I'm really sorry.

212
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,886
Oh, you betcha, hon!   
         Can you be my girl?

213
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,405
Hey, guys,         
             did you hear that?

214
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,839
Cliff clavin's                 
 got a girl!

215
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,792
Sammy, give me a bottle 
        of your best champagne!

216
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,376
All right, then.           
                Oh, maggie,

217
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:42,230
you made me            
         the happiest man       
         in the world, oh!

218
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,964
Hey, oh, sorry, guys.

219
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:47,067
You're not gonna be seein' 
     cliff clavin around here   
     very much anymore.

220
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,903
Maggie, you've made me         
 the happiest man in the world.

221
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:51,022
Oh, boy.

222
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,292
Just think of that.    
         After all these years,

223
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,227
i got myself   
                 a steady girl.

224
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,629
I'm walking on air. 
            I'm high as a kite.

225
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,900
I'm blind as a mole.

226
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,313
Cliff, is something wrong      
 with your vision?

227
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,966
Uh, no. No, uh...

228
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,401
uh, i decided to   
             just, uh...

229
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:21,869
you know what happened?

230
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:23,804
Uh, i think            
         when i popped the cork 
         on the champagne,

231
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:26,573
a little bit of mist        
    got in my eyes,             
    and temporarily blinded me.

232
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:28,343
Oh, yeah. Yeah,        
         that must be why, uh,

233
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,578
sammy wears                
     those protective goggles   
     all the time.

234
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,697
Well, that's ok.

235
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,332
I didn't want               
    champagne anyhow.

236
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,768
I just want to run out,        
 and buy                        
 something soft and silky

237
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,603
to wear                        
 at your apartment tonight.

238
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,289
Oh, yeah, it's a good idea. 
    Hey, listen,                
    why don't you, uh,

239
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:44,025
why don't you          
         go buy me one, too?

240
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,961
Ok.

241
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,378
Bye, honey.                
                 Bye.

242
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,519
Oh, my god,        
             this is terrible.

243
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:57,572
It's like                  
     the wendy beaman episode   
     all over again.

244
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,206
You guys                       
 got to help me.

245
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:02,677
Oh. Oh, you know,              
 i can see shapes now.          
 I'm coming out of it.

246
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,513
Good. Ok, yeah. I can see      
 carla's face clear as a bell.

247
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:08,766
Ah, what the heck,             
 at least i can see.

248
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,703
That's great. Let me test  
     your depth perception

249
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,855
with these 2 fingers.   
         No, no.

250
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,039
Man, this is serious.

251
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,808
(Frasier)          
             it certainly is.

252
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:20,945
Emotional crises can affect    
 our sensory perceptions

253
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,446
in devastating ways.

254
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:24,849
I've read volumes              
 on hysterical blindness,

255
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,751
loss of hearing,               
 even total loss of speech.

256
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,403
Clavin had to pick blindness.

257
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,858
Carla, you're not helping.     
         I'm not trying.

258
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,111
Cliff,

259
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:40,314
don't you think                
 there's a pattern here         
 that you should recognize?

260
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,683
Now, both your high school     
 incident and this current one

261
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,318
occurred at a time

262
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:46,921
when you were threatened       
 by a commitment                
 of a romantic nature.

263
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,624
Could it be that               
 your fear of commitment        
 is so intense,

264
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,725
that it manifests itself       
 in blindness?

265
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,129
Oh, jeez, doc,         
         that's true.

266
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,031
Oh, you got to         
         help me out here, doc.

267
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:58,866
I got margaret             
     coming over here tonight.

268
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,635
I can't go blind       
         in front of her.

269
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:03,988
She'll think               
     i'm some kind of a wacko.

270
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,740
You can't just                 
 wave a magic wand              
 and make it go away.

271
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,493
Doc, come on.              
     There's gotta be somethin' 
     you can prescribe, uh,

272
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,995
uh, ointments, drops,  
         leeches, somethin'.

273
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:16,600
Cliff, there's just            
 no quick fix. I'm sorry.

274
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,418
What? Well, there's got to     
 be some way

275
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:20,487
somebody can help me       
     out through tonight.

276
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,240
Sammy, look, as a, uh,

277
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,807

278
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,410

 come on over tonight,

279
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,696

 just to get margaret           
 in the apartment,

280
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:30,248

 then i can, uh,

281
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,066
take over myself               
 and then you can, uh,

282
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,768
skedaddle. How's that?         
             Oh, you got it.

283
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,920
Hey, thanks very much,         
 sammy. Yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,588
After you leave,           
     then my, uh,

285
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,990
acute sense of touch           
 will take over.

286

He had to say it.

287
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,644
Now i'm gonna have         
     the willies for a week.

288
00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:49,183
Well, i'm on my way            
 to the plastic surgeon,

289
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:51,234
but, i don't know what to do.  
 Look, i need some input.

290
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,104
What do you think              
 i should i have done?

291
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,471
Eyelids.                   
                    Tummy tuck.

292
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,823

295
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:01,712
I'm getting tired of all       
 this plastic surgery talk.

296
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,014
Now, i know,                   
 it may not be popular,

297
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:06,099
but i'm going out on a limb,   
 and say, uh,

298
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,552
i don't think you should       
 change a thing.

299
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,786
You're a beautiful woman

300
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,589
and just about perfect         
 the way god made you.

301
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,491
Well, woody,       
             nobody's perfect.

302
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,228
There's got to be  
             something.

303
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,679
Oh, then, your breasts.

304
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:26,320

 go over the game plan, huh?    
                 Yeah, shoot.

332

you know, sort of              
 losing my vision, i'll, uh,

give a little petite tug

 a signal to lead me back,

        do i need to know here?

345
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:08,072
Uh, well, the only other thing 
 we've got to figure out        
 is, uh, some kind of signal

346
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,741
to let you know when it's, uh, 
 time for you to leave.

         Now i just got to

350
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,350
figure out                 
     how to remember that.

368
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,928

     the--the--the best way--

369
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,730
the best way           
         to find this out

370
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:09,883
is to, uh, see how it looks 
    when you're sitting down.

Why don't we go        
         check it out           
         on the sofa there?

 that this was an ashtray.

 any other way now.

395
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,193
without, uh, any help          
 from anybody at all.

396
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,247
Ok, cliff.

397
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,581
[Clearing throat]

398
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,366
yeah? Well, ok.

399
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,470
[Clearing throat]

400
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:24,675
(cliff)            
             oh, look at this.

401
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,459
I must've dropped          
     a dime earlier.

402
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,428
[Cliff laughing]

403
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,313
oh. Here. Here it is.

404
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,832
Yep. 1973-s.

405
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,100
That's mine.

406
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:36,336
Oh, i got that, cliffie.       
 I got that.

407
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:37,721
[Clears throat]            
     um,

408
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:40,990
this is a really       
         comfortable sofa.

409
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,710
Yeah. It, uh, comes out     
    into a, you know, sofa bed.

410
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,030
Really? I'd like to see that.

411
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,247
Good night, sam.

412
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:53,787
I better, uh,

413
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,540
i better fix this lamp 
         before i go.           
         Uh, take it with you.

414
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,741
What?

415
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,710
Uh, no. That's what    
         sammy came over for.

416
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:01,929
For corn, a tie,   
             and a lamp.

417
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,584
You--you--you ought            
 to see the way this guy lives.

418
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,201
He's something.

419
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,703
Well, good night.

420
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,139
I'll walk him  
                 to the door.

421
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,457
(Cliff)                        
 thank you for coming.

422
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,543
(Sam)                          
 well, thank you for the corn.

423
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,662
Will you be able               
 to handle this?

424
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,697
Oh, yeah, sam.             
     I don't have to tell you,

425
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,434
as one stud to another, 
        that when it comes      
        to sofa bed talk,

426
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,035
it's time for lights out.

427
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,438
Oh, there you go.

428
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:28,638
Wrong way.

429
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:30,140
Thanks. Good night.

430
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,076
Oh, hey, sammy,        
         one more thing.        
                     Yeah.

431
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,310
Uh, the--

432
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,846
uh, the dress?

433
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:38,515
Oh, yeah. You unlock,  
         it's a standard        
         22-inch zipper.

434
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,584
1,2,3 seconds max. 
             Remember,

435
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,219
it's an easy glide.

436
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,521
Don't jerk it.

437
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:46,456
(Sam)       
                    good night. 
    Good night, sammy.

438
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:47,758
Oh, yeah, sure.

439
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,075
[Screaming]

440
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,811
[splashing]

441
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:53,697
cliff, are you all right?

442
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,666
(Cliff)                        
 come on in. It's heated.

443
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:04,707
(Norm)                     
     hey, cliffie,              
     how are the eyes, buddy?

444
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,993
Yeah, fine as long as          
 she's not around.

445
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,528
Oh, why?               
         Wh-wh-what happened?

446
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,397
Ah, it was a total disaster,   
 norm.

447
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:13,100
I went blind,              
     took a header              
     off the balcony

448
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,401
and fell in the pool.

449
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:16,670
Ok, pay up.

450
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,890
Falling in the pool 
            was 10-to-1 odds.

451
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:21,558
[Chuckling]                
     suckers!

452
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:24,178
Well, i'll, uh, i'll be        
 in the men's room drying off.

453
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,196
Oh, there's no towels  
         in there, mr. Clavin.

454
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,815
Ah, that's all right.   
        I'll stand in front     
        of that whatchamacallit

455
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:29,933
that blows hot air.

456
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,534
You mean               
         the automatic clavin.

457
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,873
Is cliff here?

458
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,574
Oh, he's in the bathroom       
 drying off.

459
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,177
Oh, thank god. Because         
 i was so worried about him.

460
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,179
Poor cliff                 
     has been through so much.

461
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,747
You just sit right here.       
 I'll get you some coffee.

462
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,117
Margaret, um,

463
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,219
you should know

464
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:52,022
that cliff         
             is a troubled,     
             deeply disturbed,

465
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,791
and emotionally    
             stunted person.

466
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,160
Now, i can say this

467
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,262
because i'm one of his 
         closest friends.

468
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,383
All right, rebecca's back.

469
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,736
You, uh, decided what to have  
 the body and fender man fix?

470
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:10,257
I not only made            
     the decision by myself,    
     thank you very much,

471
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:14,027
but i've already           
     had the surgery performed  
     on an outpatient basis.

472
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,395
Already?

473
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:16,797
Wow, they look great.

474
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:23,637
Woody, he didn't    
            work on my breasts.

475
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:25,806
Well, then, why are they       
 so much perkier?

476
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,677
Thank you, woody.

477
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:32,112
No. Thank you.

478
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,733
So, uh, what did   
             you do then?

479
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,534
Uh,

480
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,903
let's just say                 
 it was something personal.

481
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,339
Whoa, come on.     
             You can tell us.   
                     Yeah.

482
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,341
It was nothing major.      
     It was just--

483
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,943
it was just a little thing     
 that i wanted done             
 for a long time.

484
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,579
Ah, you're right.          
     You shouldn't tell us.

485
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:51,281
I mean that way,               
 we can let our imaginations    
 go wild.

486
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,167
[All hooting]

487
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:54,768
oh, god. All right, fine.

488
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:57,737
I had a little tattoo removed.

489
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:00,307
Ooh, you're kidding.       
     That's very hot.           
     Whoa, wait a minute.

490
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,560
Where was it? Inner,        
    upper, outer, frontal...

491
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,195
it was on my lower back.

492
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,363
Oh, lower back.

493
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:10,250
It was just covering up 
        a big old ugly mole.

494
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:12,285
I had that removed, too.

495
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,622
Kind of wish                   
 she hadn't told us.

496
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:22,062
I mean, i was imagining    
     something a hell of a lot  
     better than that.

497
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,431
Well, maybe she lied.

498
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,333
Yeah. Yeah,                
     let's go with that.

499
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,255
Cliff!                  
                    (Cliff)     
                    oh, no. No.

500
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,906
No, wait. Cliff,               
 you don't have to run.

501
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,258
Sam explained everything.

502
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:38,545
Well, then you know        
     why i can't look at you?   
 Yes i do.

503
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:40,347
I know all about high school

504
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:43,183
and wendy beaman       
         and the blindness      
         and miss tennessee.

505
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,385
Miss tennessee?

506
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:47,754
Uh, yeah, cliffie. I ran out   
 of stuff on you,

507
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:50,039
so i threw in              
     some of my own highlights.

508
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,395
I--i feel so bad about this.

509
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:57,430
I--i rushed you             
    into a commitment

510
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:58,798
that you weren't           
     ready to make.

511
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:02,035
I came down from canada        
 without any warning,

512
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:06,573
never giving you               
 a chance to say no             
 or even make up your mind.

513
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,641
And i feel like            
     this is all my fault,

514
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,879
so i'm going back       
        up north.

515
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:15,182
(Margaret)                     
 we can talk                    
 on the phone.

516
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:18,168
And, in a few months,      
     if we still think          
     it's a good idea,

517
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,036
we know                    
     where to find each other.

518
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:22,305
Goodbye, cliff.

519
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:26,709
Hey, hey, cliff!

520
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:28,111
Go get her!                    
 Go get her!

521
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,596
Uh, maggie,        
             hold on!

522
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,381
Maggie!

523
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,418
I'm ready              
         to make a commitment.

524
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,705
Hey, maggie, i can see.

525
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,675
Oh, really?                    
 Honey, that's wonderful.

526
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:43,860
(Cliff)             
            i, uh...

527
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,396
[sighing]

528
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:47,964
i want you to be my honey.

529
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,368
Well, then,

530
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,170
i don't want to wait   
         any longer.

531
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:55,405
I'm going to rush over 
         to my hotel

532
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,073
and i'm gonna get my stuff

533
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:59,493
and i'll meet you in an hour   
 at your apartment.

534
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,279
