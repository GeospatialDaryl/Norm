to meeting you.

I was a big fan of yours.

      Oh. Any fan of mine

144

         things are going pretty
         good at the old bar.

to hear that.

of bucks into it.

Oh, boy, don't talk to me       
      about sinking, man.

     of great stories, huh?

00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:09,438
                  because it was

 it work somehow, doesn't she?

    down at corporate

00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:50,031
Oh, right. Sure.                
He's gonna come over here       

493
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,967
and fire you                    
because of one lousy kiss.      

494
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,702
      Talk about paranoid.

          ( <i>knocking</i> )          

496
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,305
        Miss Howe.              
  Mr. Drake's here to see you.  

497
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,708
    Talk about coincidence.     

498
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:00,842
                    I'm dead.   

499
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:01,943
No, you're not.                 

500
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,445
  Now, I'll take care of this.  
             Uh...              

501
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,447
      Woody, can you stall      
      for a minute there?       

502
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:07,432
             Sure.              

503
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,100
You know, in high school,       

504
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:11,303
I entered

505
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:13,438
Not us, Woody-- him, him.       

506

                    Not us, him.

507
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,573
                 Out there, boy.
                 Come on.       

508
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:16,658
             Okay?              

509
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,326
Sure, Sam.                      

510
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,296
    Would it have killed you    
 to be a little more specific?  

511
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:25,550
     What am I going to do?     

512
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:26,635
Well, just wait. Uh...          

513
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:28,603
Well, all right,                
I'll-I'll go out there          

514
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:29,671
and I'll tell him, uh,          

515
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:30,839
      that you were bombed      

516
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,407
            and that            
    it didn't mean anything.    

517
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,508
Terrific. Wonderful image.      

518
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,410
     A girl goes to a party     
    and gets hammered,          

519
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:36,644
    then turns promiscuous.     

520
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:38,130
Well, all right,                
all right, uh...                

521
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:39,797
I'll-I'll tell him              
that, uh,                       

522
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,566
that you were trying            
to make me jealous              

523
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,368
'cause you're crazy             
in love with me.                

524
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,087
    That's...                   

525
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,691
          Let me see.           

526
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:50,892
         My choices are         

527
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:53,361
      I'm a boozy slut...       

528
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:56,163
      or a complete idiot.      

529
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:59,484
I'd go with the idiot.          

530
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:01,803
         I already did.         

531
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,675
        So, that's how we       
        knew, beyond a doubt,   

532
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,094
      that we were putting      
     way, way too much bran     

533
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:12,297
      in the pig's fodder.      

534
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:19,621
Hi, Evan.                       

535
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:20,622
                      Oh, Sam...

536
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:21,756
What are you                    
doing here, huh?                

537
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,191
             Well, I was on my  
             way to the airport,

538
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:24,392
                and I thought   
                I'd come by here

539
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:26,360
        and clear this matter   
        up before I left.       

540
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,996
Oh, yeah, listen,               
I gotta tell you,               

541
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,264
that whole thing                
at the party was my fault.      

542
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,616
I mean,                         
we had had a little tiff,       

543
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,785
and she was trying              
to make me jealous.             
                        Yeah,   

544
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,119
            I figured it was    
            something like that.

545
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:36,488
        Yeah.                   
                        Yeah.   

546
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:37,556
                  Well, I better
                  go back there 

547
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,890
        and apologize to her.   

548
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,225
    Wait, wa...                 

549
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:41,859
You're going to apologize?      

550
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,194
                  Well, yeah,   
                  I overreacted.

551
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:44,829
                  I was a little
                  rough on her. 

552
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:45,830
    Oh.                         

553
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:46,831
                        Yeah.   

554
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,065
Uh, actually, uh,               

555
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,501
          give me a second here,
          will you? Um...       

556
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,002
          She probably          
      needs to freshen up.      

557
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:52,837
    She's pretty upset          
      by this whole thing.      

558
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:57,141
     Her mascara's probably     
down in her shoes by now.       

559
00:20:57,175 --> 00:21:00,061
How much do I owe you           
for that, bartender?            

560
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:01,446
Oh, no charge, Mr. Drake.       

561
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,915
    I mean, after all,          
you kind of own the place.      

562
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:06,451
Oh, no, no, no, no,             
I'll pay for it.                

563
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:08,220
Credit card okay?               

564
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,221
             Sure.              

565
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:10,222
All right.                      

566
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:11,923
        I'll need to see        
      a driver's license.       

567
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:18,046
          Listen, I did my best.

568
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,931
             I mean, I gave him 
             the jealousy story,

569
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,199
      but he just didn't buy it.

570
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,501
        I tell you, man,        
     he is really steamed.      

571
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,386
             Damn.              

572
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,723
            You know, he said   
            that if, uh,        

573
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:30,492
              if you were really
              in love with me,  

574
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:31,826
    that he might understand.   

575
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,961
You know, that it would         
explain everything,             

576
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:35,497
but he just...                  
didn't buy that.                

577
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,365
                Oh, God, what am
                I going to do?  

578
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,267

I don't know.                   

579
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:41,252
        Unless...               

580
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:42,554
    Unless what? What?          

581
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:45,323
Ah... No, no, yeah,             
yeah, that wouldn't work.       

582
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:46,507
                No, no, what?   
                Tell me, please.

583
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,609
Well, all right, well,          
maybe, you know, if...          

584
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:50,262
well, if he were                
to walk in here                 

585
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:51,496
and find you kissing me         

586
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,632
more passionately               
than you kissed him...          

587

                    Forget it,  
                    forget it,

              Let me tell you   
              something, buster.
All right.

            I still have a

for how I reacted earlier.      

610
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:45,650
                      Apologize?

611
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:47,452
                    To <i>me?</i>      

612
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,120
Well, yeah, I told Sam outside. 

613
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,088
                You told Sam?   

614
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,192
    Gotcha.                     

615
00:22:57,496 --> 00:23:00,047
      So why don't we just      
not say anything more about it? 

616
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,382
I think                         
that's a great idea.            

617
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,485
Uh, let me walk you             
to the car here.                
            Yeah.               

618
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,719
            Malone.             
No, no.                         

619
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:06,487
     I think we should say      
    nothing more about this.    

620
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:15,013
      Sam, get back here.       

621
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:17,849
Ha. Some women                  
just can't get enough.          

622
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:21,152
                 You haven't met
                 my wife, Sam.  

623
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,453
SAM:                            
Oh... Oh...                     

624
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:23,487
Good night.                     

625
00:23:25,724 --> 00:23:27,659
Hey, listen. Come on.           

626
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,294
I'm just having                 
a little fun with you.          

627
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,795
You know,                       
I know why you're upset.        

628
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:32,430
You found out something         
in that room                    

629
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:33,464
you hadn't counted on.          

630
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,533
Your true feelings              
were revealed.                  

631
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:37,302
             What?              

632
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:39,053
No woman                        
can kiss like that              

633
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:40,422
and not mean it.                

634
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:41,305
            Are you nuts?       

635
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,557
No, no, no.                     

636
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:43,724
No, it can't be done.           

637
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,393
You can't fake passion          
like that.                      

638
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:47,062
    Oh, is that right?          

639
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,096
Hey, Fras.                      

640
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,793
                Nice try.       

641
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:07,365
                Frasier?        

642
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:09,667
         <i>Frasier?</i>               
      <i>(</i> <i>Frasier hiccups</i> )
