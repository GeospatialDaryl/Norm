1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,750
Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,197
Hey, everybody,
I got a letter from my dog.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,636
Pretty spiffy handwriting for a dog.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,438
Well, it's not actually
from my dog.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,194
My mom writes the letters
as if they're from my dog, Truman.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,034
Weird beyond imagination, Norm.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,079
Listen to this:.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,879
"Dear Woody,
Boy, what a great day I had.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,598
I pulled all the laundry
off the line,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,273
chewed up your father's
bowling shoes,

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,194
and grabbed a Yankee pot roast
off the table. Yum, yum."

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,949
Isn't that cute?

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,591
The mutt eats better than I do.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,030
"By the way, now that you're
not here to keep me in line,

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,111
your mother's thinking
about putting me to sleep.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,599
I certainly wouldn't blame her,

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,433
and I don't want you to either
after I'm gone."

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,317
Sam, cover me.
I gotta make a phone call.

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,438
- Drinks are up.
- Right away.

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,876
I need a vodka Gibson, up,
a bloody mary,

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,793
a Johnnie Walker black,
two Beck's, and change for a 20.

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,879
- Change for a 20, Sam.
- Damn!

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,600
Carla's been on the phone
for two hours here.

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,150
She probably got an obscene
phone call and won't let him off.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,669
Okay, five, ten, ten, 20.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,512
Can you believe it, Sam?
How far I've come?

27
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,468
Right before your eyes,
I've turned into a waitressing machine.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,834
Even in this pandemonium,

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,355
I have everything
perfectly under control.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,511
There you go.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,033
And here's your
change for the 20.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,918
Thank you.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,714
See what I mean?

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,758
Always sit at her station.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,037
Did you hear that, Sam?

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,792
Still busy.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,669
Sam, I've got to get home

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
and start preparing for that interview
for the part-time job.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,198
What interview?

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,316
You know, the teaching assistant
at the college.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,999
Oh, right.
All right, go on, take off.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,798
Woody and l
will take care of you here.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,072
Listen, don't fall in that same
trap you did with Sumner.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,428
Sam, my intimate relationship
with Sumner

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,151
had nothing to do with the fact
that I was his teaching assistant.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,471
Sumner took advantage
of a naive young coed.

47
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,200
I have learned since then,
from bitter experience.

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,999
I am older, wiser,

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,072
and I have a lot more units
under my belt.

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,039
Hey, Woody, give me a refill,
would you?

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,878
Coming up.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,470
You know, Mr. Peterson,
you're amazing.

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,198
How do you keep
putting them away?

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,233
Well, it's all done with mirrors, son.

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,550
I just never look in one.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,319
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,790
Buckle your seatbelts and get ready
for a blast into the unknown.

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,997
I've got a phenomenon here
which, well, I'm sure will inspire

59
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,596
the legendary Jack Palance
to utter the infamous words,

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,273
"Believe it or not."

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,036
Get a load of this.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,791
- What's that?
- Potato, right?

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,438
It's no ordinary, common,
garden-variety russet, Norm.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,637
Though, I'm proud to say,
I did grow it myself.

65
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,679
It's the spitting image
of Richard Milhous Nixon. Look.

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,998
What, you find this amusing?

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,391
No. No, I find it
historically significant, Cliff.

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,393
Look, look at the eye.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,478
Well, all right, forget about the third
one there, but look at those eyes.

70
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,074
The ski-jump nose, the jowls, huh?

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,676
He's even got a little bit of sweat
there on the upper lip.

72
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,159
Come on, man.

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,511
All right, maybe this
will help you out.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,593
I am not a crook.

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,550
Sorry, it still doesn't
look like Nixon.

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,399
Sure sounds like him though.

77
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,195
Hi, guys.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,836
Hey, Carla, I got a potato here
looks just like Richard Nixon.

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,950
Big deal. Find one that doesn't,
then get back to me.

80
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,028
We were really hopping around here
a couple hours ago, you know.

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,474
So why didn't you
call me sooner?

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,437
I tried to, but your phone
was busy.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,996
Oh, sorry. My oldest must have been
talking to his girlfriend.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,555
- Where's Diane anyway?
- Oh, I gave her the night off.

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,395
She's trying to interview for a TA job
down at the college.

86
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,389
She'll never get it.
She's a big A with no Ts.

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,791
So Anthony has got himself
a girlfriend, huh?

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,354
It's sickening, Sam.

89
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,193
Everyday it's,
"Annie this. Annie that."

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,033
Walks around the apartment
all moony-eyed.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,839
I think my kid's
turned into a weenie.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,638
Well, don't be too hard
on the lad, Carla.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,791
You know, men will
do some pretty strange things

94
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,632
to have a woman by their side.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,314
In your case, inflate one.

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,791
You know who I hold
responsible for this? Nick.

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,270
- Who's Nick?
- He's Anthony's father.

98
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,351
His biological father.

99
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,479
Wow, a scientist.

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,630
You know, what my boy
needs now

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,189
is just a little adult male
companionship

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,793
to snap him out of this.

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,109
How about it, Sam?

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,114
Come on, find somebody else.
Call Nick.

105
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,390
Come on. You know Nick's idea
of fatherhood:

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,154
When the egg splits,
so does he.

107
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,193
- Come on.
- What exactly would I have to do?

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,476
Just take him out and show him
a great time, you know?

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,278
A real night on the town.

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,432
Wild, crazy, borderline illegal.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,433
I guess I could handle that.
Yeah, why not?

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,398
It's about time the kid learned
how much fun it was to play the field.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,312
- Right.
- Hey, wait just a second here.

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,789
Let's not give marriage
a bad rap, huh?

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,632
It's a fine institution.

116
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,950
Matter of fact, go ahead
and ask any single man here

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,588
if he wouldn't gladly trade places
with me for a night.

118
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,192
Anybody?

119
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,079
Please.

120
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,468
One night.

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,428
Oh, come on, fellas. I'm offering
transportation and a hot meal.

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,031
No, no, this is second-term Nixon.
Yeah.

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,318
Yeah, this tater is definitely showing
the strain of Watergate here.

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,192
Not--? Not newsworthy?

125
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,828
Oh, well, excuse me for living there,
buddy boy.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,788
Yeah, I'll call you back
when my potato marries a rock star!

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,071
New York Times, my foot!

128
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,277
If the news doesn't come out
of Moscow, they're not interested.

129
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,351
Hey, what do you think?
You like the game?

130
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,397
Yeah, that was great.
Where's your phone, Sammo?

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,152
Oh, come on, give her a break,
will you?

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,233
You called her four times tonight.
She's probably half asleep.

133
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,638
Cheers.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,319
Just a minute.

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,199
Who you looking for?

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,160
Some girl wants to talk
to the outlaw of love.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,829
She tracked me down.

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,355
Hey, hey, that's Annie.
That's Annie. Let me have it.

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,834
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,072
He's fine, Annie,
and he'll call you tomorrow.

141
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,231
Yes, he's still a hunk.

142
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,436
Okay, I will. Good night.

143
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,790
I owe you one, Sam.

144
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,910
Anthony, consider yourself
kissed good night.

145
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,310
Okay, you want
that root beer, huh?

146
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,670
Great. That's me
and Annie's favourite.

147
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,673
She loves it when I make it
come out my nose.

148
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,717
Yeah, I know.
That always works for me too.

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,469
Listen, Anthony...

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,190
-...I know you like Annie a lot--
- Oh, no.

151
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,679
I love her.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,113
Anthony, there's only two times
a man uses that word:

153
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,111
tennis, and when he's already
paid for the room.

154
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,474
You know what I mean?

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,395
My ma, she says the same thing.

156
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,154
She acts like we're kids
or something.

157
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,158
I'll tell you, just between you and me--
I mean, you don't tell my ma.

158
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,311
Me and Annie,
we're talking about getting married.

159
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,879
- What? You get her pregnant?
- Oh, she ain't pregnant!

160
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,554
We think that sex before marriage
is a sin.

161
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,432
Afterwards, it's just one more
damn thing

162
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,636
to take your pants off for,
you know?

163
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,197
Anthony, you don't know
what you're doing.

164
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,634
I mean, look at me, will you?

165
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,951
I'm single.
I've got a great life going here.

166
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,472
Look, most guys go through
their entire life with only one woman.

167
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,155
- Yeah.
- I got three under Q.

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,038
This whole book is women?

169
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,719
This book and my life.

170
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,552
Tell you what...

171
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,949
...pick a name, any name.

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,917
I'm gonna show you
what a no-strings good time

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,638
I got at my fingertips here.

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,552
Go ahead. Any name.

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,517
- Beth Hollister.
- Beth Hollister.

176
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,672
All right. Very good choice.

177
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,718
It's a toll call, but it's worth it.

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,152
Hey, Beth? Hi, it's Sam Malone.

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,470
Yeah. Yeah, well, I know
it's been a long time.

180
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,916
That's why I'm calling. I thought
maybe we'd get together tonight.

181
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,959
Oh, no. Well, is it something
you can put off until later?

182
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,154
No, no, no.

183
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,437
No, I wouldn't want you to miss
your first Weight Watchers meeting.

184
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,838
Tomorrow? Me? Well...

185
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,716
God, Beth, I think my appendix
just burst. Will you excuse me?

186
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,071
Being single means
you gotta think fast on your feet.

187
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,470
Go ahead. Pick another name.
Any name.

188
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,113
- Candy. Candy Simpson.
- Candy Simpson.

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,670
Come to Papa. All right.
You're good, kid.

190
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,400
Then again, so is Candy.

191
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,919
Hi, is Candy in?

192
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,479
Candy. Sam Malone.

193
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,272
Yeah, you remember me?

194
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,629
Yeah, all right.

195
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,270
You still into hot fudge sundaes
for breakfast?

196
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,830
You're not?
Oh, hell, I'm on the wrong page here.

197
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,637
Listen...

198
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,110
...what I want-- What I want
to say here, Candy...

199
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,998
...is I want you.

200
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,559
Yeah. Well, there you go.

201
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,438
Will you excuse me for a minute?

202
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,269
This is getting kind of hot.
I'm gonna take this in my office.

203
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,634
Woody, you wanna hang that up?

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,439
Just make yourself comfortable there.

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,195
That guy's got a great life,
doesn't he?

206
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,549
Great?

207
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,995
He's got no one to come home to,
nobody to care about,

208
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,549
and no reason to even get up
in the morning.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,434
And he drives a Corvette.

210
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,470
This looks excellent,
Miss Chambers.

211
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,710
I'd have to say,
on the basis of this résumé,

212
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,348
that you're my leading candidate.

213
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,796
Oh, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.

214
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,155
I think you're the best
in your department,

215
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,231
and I'd love to work with you.

216
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,234
Well, good. Now, I do have to interview
a couple of people tomorrow,

217
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,039
but I'll be letting you know anon.

218
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,919
Terribly good to hear
the King's English.

219
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,389
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh, my pleasure.

220
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,637
Oh, by the way, I got an excellent
recommendation for you.

221
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,754
- Recommendation?
- From Sumner Sloane.

222
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,798
He's a colleague of mine.
You used to work for him, right?

223
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,752
That's right.

224
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,831
How nice of him.
Lovely man, Sumner.

225
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,793
He gave you very high marks.

226
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,675
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

227
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,316
High marks?

228
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,035
What exactly did you mean
by that?

229
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,234
Well, among other things, that you
have an unbridled enthusiasm.

230
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,791
I see. Goodbye.

231
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,874
I'm a little unclear on "enthusiasm."

232
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,359
Well, enthusiasm:

233
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,795
That you don't mind taking on
extra duties

234
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,793
and working overtime, if necessary.

235
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,355
Of course that's what he meant.
What else could he mean?

236
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,152
Goodbye.

237
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,951
I will not sleep with you!

238
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,832
What?

239
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,308
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I said that.

240
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,870
I think that concludes our interview.

241
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,791
Dr Moffat, I'm terribly sorry.

242
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,713
I didn't for a moment mean to imply
that you want to have sex with me.

243
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,075
I'm sure that's the farthest thing
from your mind.

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,879
Not that you don't have
a healthy interest in sex.

245
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,196
I'm sure you think about it
all the time.

246
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,237
Well, not all the time.
You're not obsessed.

247
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,271
But when it comes to sex,

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,908
I'm sure you could hold your own
with a man half your age.

249
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,391
That's not to say
that you like young men.

250
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,437
Or any men.

251
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,439
Not that any man wouldn't be
happy to have you.

252
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,279
As would any woman.
Except me.

253
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,431
Although, I could be.
But I'm not.

254
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,318
But that's not saying
that I couldn't be.

255
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,916
This just isn't the time or the place
or the circumstance.

256
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,310
But by that, I'm certainly not saying
that you're flabby.

257
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,630
Why did I say that?

258
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,879
This isn't going well, is it?

259
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,749
Okay. All right, everybody.
Open your eyes.

260
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,077
What's--? What's so funny?

261
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,919
A blue suit with a brown tie?

262
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,317
Well, hey, I did the best I could,
you know.

263
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,836
It's not easy coming up with
a Ken doll on short notice.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,309
I wonder if you guys realize
how limited his wardrobe is.

265
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,158
Now, Barbie's is
much more extensive.

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,198
She's got her own car,
little high heels.

267
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,112
Cliff. Listen to me, Cliff.

268
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,713
You're my best friend, okay?

269
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,549
If the situation were reversed,
I'd want you to say this to me.

270
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,558
You've gone completely
off the deep end.

271
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,399
You've always been
kind of a weird guy,

272
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,232
but this is just a little bit
too much.

273
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,077
I want you to look what you've done
and think about this, Cliff.

274
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,440
You've knocked the head off a doll
and put a potato in its place.

275
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,397
And you actually want people
to, like, come and know this.

276
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,229
Well, yeah, I guess you're right,
Normie.

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,594
Yeah.

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,591
Been taking it
a little bit too seriously.

279
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,990
I've been under some
strain lately and...

280
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,309
It's okay, it's okay.

281
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,552
Thanks. You know, thanks for
pulling in those reins and saying,

282
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,109
"Whoa, Paint,
you're working up a froth."

283
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,515
Hey, how's Anthony doing, Carla?

284
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,671
I hope he didn't break
little Annie's heart.

285
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,354
But then again,
he did see life in the Sammy lane.

286
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,951
Oh, how do you do that? How do you
make your eyes shake like that?

287
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,318
Anthony's talking about
getting married!

288
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,115
I don't know what happened
after he left here,

289
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,554
but up until that point,

290
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,314
Annie had "Destination Dump City"
written all over her.

291
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,074
Yeah, well, he said he'd only been
thinking about getting married

292
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,111
until last night
when you changed his mind.

293
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,236
No way did he want to end up,
and I quote,

294
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,709
"A lonely old skirt-chaser like Sam."

295
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,148
Blasphemy.

296
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,193
What did you tell my kid, huh?

297
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,958
Well, basically, why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?

298
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,272
Well, I'll tell you why.

299
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,908
Companionship,
warmth on a cold night,

300
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,355
someone to share
your old age with.

301
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,590
You think he should marry her?

302
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,755
I thought we were talking
about a cow.

303
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,194
- Hey, Ma!
- Hello, Mrs Tortelli.

304
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,311
Vixen.

305
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,518
- Nice to see you too.
- What are you doing here?

306
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,914
Look, Ma, I don't like us being
all mad at each other.

307
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,239
You know I love you.

308
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,038
So let's be buds.

309
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,828
What do you want?

310
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,595
I don't want nothing.

311
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,115
Except for you to sign
this consent form, Ma.

312
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,519
Consent?

313
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,432
You want me to sign
a consent form?

314
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,149
Yeah. Annie's parents
already agreed to sign it, Ma.

315
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,874
Sure, no problem.
I'll sign a consent form.

316
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,513
This is my new way
of signing my name.

317
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,432
- Ma!
- No! You're only 16.

318
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,993
You were pregnant
when you were 16.

319
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,919
Yeah, but I wasn't stupid enough
to be married.

320
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,357
Come on, Anthony. Let's just take
the bus to Jersey to see your old man.

321
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,397
You only need
one parent's permission.

322
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,352
Oh, forget him.
My father's a bum.

323
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,869
Hey, don't you talk
about your father that way.

324
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,709
- Okay, he's a sleazy bum.
- That's better.

325
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,194
But I'll tell you this, Ma:

326
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,271
If I don't get your consent,
I'll get his,

327
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,671
because one way or another,
I am marrying Annie.

328
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,636
And I was hoping that I could have
Annie as my lovely wife

329
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,279
and still keep my mother.

330
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,480
Ma, don't make me make a choice.

331
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
Come on, Anthony,
you don't mean that.

332
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,758
He's a proud man, Mrs Tortelli.

333
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,674
I guess that's why I love him
more than any man I've ever known.

334
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,712
Isn't she great, Ma?

335
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,154
Yeah.

336
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,912
I'm not losing a son,

337
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,433
I'm gaining your face.

338
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,232
You're not making
any points here, Ma.

339
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,436
- What am I supposed to do, Sam?
- Just calm down.

340
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,079
I gotta stop this.

341
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,071
I can't believe they're serious.

342
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,111
I can't believe that
any son of Nick Tortelli

343
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,511
would even think about getting married
without a bun in some oven.

344
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,277
Sam, Sammy!
That is the answer!

345
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,873
Listen, listen.

346
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,996
Anthony is a Tortelli man, right?

347
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,991
Now, all Tortelli men are scum.

348
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,516
Ergo, given time,
his eye will wander,

349
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,717
and the rest of his slimy body
will follow.

350
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,115
Come on, Mrs Tortelli,
we haven't got all day.

351
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,033
I have to clean my room
before dinner.

352
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,795
I just don't see what your hurry is.

353
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,918
I mean, why don't you two have
a little engagement period, huh?

354
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,872
I'll tell you what,
I'll make a deal with you.

355
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,837
Give me two weeks.

356
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,749
What do you mean?

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,353
You two stay totally apart.

358
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,397
Don't see each other,
don't talk to each other,

359
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,516
don't send messages
for two weeks.

360
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,672
Then, at that time,
if you still want to get married,

361
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,068
I'll give you my blessing.

362
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,193
- That's all we have to do?
- That's all?

363
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,435
I'll die.

364
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,070
Our burning love
will keep you alive, Anthony.

365
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,914
I don't know.

366
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,838
What's the matter, Anthony?
You afraid?

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,116
Listen, if you don't think your
love is strong enough--

368
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,033
Oh, no, no. We ain't afraid of nothing.
Okay, you got it.

369
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,834
But we come back here
in two weeks

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,513
and we're even more sure.

371
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,035
And after that we'll be together,
forever and ever.

372
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,430
You mean like through eternity?

373
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
No, like through the weekend, momar.

374
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
I'm gonna be heartsick missing you.

375
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,470
That is the most childish, unsanitary
thing I've ever seen in my life.

376
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,589
Boy, I'll say. Don't they realize that
gum is a breeding ground for cooties?

377
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,875
Anthony, would you get
away from the window?

378
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,112
You're fogging up the glass
with your lovesick breath.

379
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,952
Don't be such a grump, Ma.

380
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,190
I warned you my feelings
wouldn't change.

381
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Not in two weeks,
not in two years.

382
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,991
You blew it.

383
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,319
I'm dead meat, Sam.

384
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,596
I thought you had this
figured out, logically.

385
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,591
Yeah, well, he never went out
of the damn house.

386
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,990
How's he supposed to have his head
turned by another woman

387
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,673
if he never saw one?

388
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,149
He just locked himself in a room,
and he never came out

389
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,073
except for hot meals
and cold showers.

390
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,350
So you gonna sign the consent?

391
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,511
What else can I do?

392
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,716
They kept their end of the bargain.

393
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,634
- Anthony!
- Annie!

394
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,953
Sinuses, Carla.

395
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,713
Well, Mrs Tortelli,
it's been two weeks.

396
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,440
I think it's still clear that Anthony and l
are very much in love

397
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,158
and wanna get married.
Right, Anthony?

398
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,993
That's right.
Here's the form, Ma.

399
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,310
You said you would sign it.

400
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,031
You're too damn young, Anthony.

401
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,714
Please, this is the worst mistake
anybody could make.

402
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,598
Believe me, I made it.

403
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,318
You gave your word.

404
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,555
Yeah, I did, didn't l?

405
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,153
Hey, hurry it up, Annie.
I'm double-parked.

406
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,715
We'll be right there.
Won't this be great, Anthony?

407
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,075
You and me together for all time.

408
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,276
Yeah, that's great. Who is that?

409
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,756
Oh, that's my cousin, Gabrielle.
Gabrielle, my fiancé.

410
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,514
Will you hurry it up and sign?
We haven't got all day.

411
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,915
Hey, Gabrielle, it's nice to meet you.

412
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,793
Nice to meet you.
You're even cuter than Annie said.

413
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,513
How come I haven't
met you before?

414
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,712
I've been at cheerleading school.

415
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,400
Hey, when are we having
your cousin over for dinner?

416
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,677
Let's say we get married first.
Then we'll discuss the dinner guests.

417
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,068
Yeah, well, my word is my word.

418
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,958
I guess I'd better be signing
this document

419
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,997
so you two can be alone
together forever.

420
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,479
What's your hurry, Ma?

421
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,756
Why don't you buds
have a root beer?

422
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,070
I'm gonna help Gabrielle
find a parking space.

423
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,071
- I'm worried about her.
- Anthony!

424
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,390
Hey, just get off my back.
This will take two minutes.

425
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,039
Nag, nag, nag.

426
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,678
Gabrielle, you ever have
a hot fudge sundae for breakfast?

427
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,918
- They're not coming back, are they?
- Nope.

428
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,835
Gee, and I got 50 boy cousins
who can drive.

429
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,153
It was bound to happen.

430
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,432
Pretty smart, Mrs Tortelli.

431
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,033
Let me fill you in
on something, Annie.

432
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,749
There are three things
that you can say about Tortelli men:

433
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,390
One, they draw women like flies.

434
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,472
Two, they treat women like flies.

435
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,512
Three, their brains are in their flies.

436
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,558
Yeah, one more thing:

437
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,676
They throw away
the best women.

438
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,029
You know, for a loser,
you're not bad.

439
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,037
Ditto, Mrs T.
