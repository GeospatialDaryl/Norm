Hail, fellows.          
        I bring ye joyful news.

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,208
Judging from               
     the unusual movements of   
     our little child-to-be,

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,677
it would appear that    
        the birth of a cranelet 
        is imminent.

5
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:13,912
Give or take a month.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,615
Oh, feel that, dadders.        
 I think it was an elbow.

7
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,886
Hello, little elbow.

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,553
Wait, wait, wait.

9
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,806
Now you can actually, uh,      
 feel the little kid in there?  
     Mmm-hmm.

10
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:27,959
You don't mean to tell me      
 that in the myriad of times    
 carla's been pregnant,

11
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,845
you've never felt              
 her babies move?

12
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:32,980
Hey, no guy touches my belly   
 unless he's paying for dinner.

13
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:38,420
Lilith, might the boys         
 have the privilege             
 of experience

14
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:39,838
this divine movement           
 within you?

15
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,123
Oh, certainly.             
     Put your hands here.

16
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:48,029
There,                 
         did you feel that?

17
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,198
Nah, i--i didn't   
             feel anything.

18
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,900
I think                     
    i heard him move.

19
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:54,836
No, no, that was               
 my stomach grumbling.

20
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,104
I haven't had a bite           
 since breakfast.

21

Hey, i think                
    your stomach just moved.

00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,212
Hey, guys, check this out. 
     You can really feel this.

Hmm.

 in there, doesn't it?

 those licking pictures.

        i'm much obliged to you 
        for your suggestion

109
00:04:58,163 --> 00:04:59,964
that i unload          
         the south end property

110
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,333
before the market price 
        bottomed out.

 quite a nifty little profit.

 Well, actually,                
 miss howe, no.

 the land values                
 are so depressed

114
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,877
might be considered,           
 uh, insane,

115
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,712
so i've, um,                   
 done just the opposite.

116
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,880

117
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,882

 urban complex.

118
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,650

 something i've done

Well, you see, first,      
     we bulldoze the land...

123
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:28,860
oh!

124
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,179
Did i startle you?

125
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,713
Yes, but i like it.

126

00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:05,830
Oh, yes.           
             Thank you, miles.

139
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,665
Uh, i do seem to have          
 made a bit of a mess here.

140
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,701
Miles, would you get someone   
 to clean this up?

141
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,719
In fact, i'd like to   
         buy you another one.

142
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,321
Oh, it's just          
         an old blotter.

143
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,506
No, i meant the desk.

144
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,623
Ok.

145
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:17,625
I'll see to it, sir.

146
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,194
Thank you.

147
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,062
Well, i want to thank you      
 for drawing my attention

148
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,364
to south end,                  
 and, um, i owe you dinner.

149
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,033
I love dinner.

150
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:27,418
Unfortunately, at this moment  
 i'm heading out to             
 beverly hills.

151
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,403
I love beverly hills.

152
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:32,323
I do realize this is       
     a bit sudden, but, uh,

153
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,242
would you care to join me?

154
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,460
No, i didn't mean it   
         like that.

155
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:39,397
I meant,                
        i love beverly hills    
        in general,

156
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,031
i didn't mean

157
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,434
"to whisk me away          
     on your private jet."

158
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,920
You do have a private jet, 
     don't you?

159
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,187
Oh, yes.

160
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:48,606
I wouldn't even know       
     what to wear,

161
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,575
if someone took me to      
     dinner in beverly hills.

162
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,276
I have credit lines            
 up and down rodeo.

163
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,278
It would be my pleasure        
 to outfit you.

164
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,030
That is,                       
 if you don't mind shopping.

165
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,548
I love shopping.

166
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,687
This is great, sammy.

167
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,054
Uh, what time          
         you open tomorrow?

168
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,489
I'll bring             
         my laundry, huh?

169
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:06,558
Believe it or not,

170
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,626
some people care            
    about their appearance.

171
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,862
I could take that       
        as an insult, you know.

172
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,564
If i cared about   
             my appearance.

173
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,617
I'm sure miles has brought     
 the car around.

174
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:16,951
[Gasps]

175
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,220
he's sure          
             miles has brought  
             the car around.

176
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,659
Well, that spot's better.

177
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:28,345
Anybody, uh, anybody see if    
 that english guy left yet?

178
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:29,581
Oh, he just took off.

179
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,883
Oh, yeah? All right.

180
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,834
Fellas, fellas,    
             here we go.

181
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,753
Now remember,          
         nobody opens this door

182
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,355
even if you hear screaming.

183
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,457
Especially if       
            you hear screaming.

184
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,943
(Sam)      
                     rebecca.

185
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,245
Rebecca?

186
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:47,698
Rebecca?

187
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:58,560
Hey, woodpile,             
     what are you up to there?

188
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,328
I'm makin' a map           
     of all the places

189
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,864
mr. Colcord's              
     taken miss howe            
     over the past 3 days.

190
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,516
Every one of               
     these beer nuts represents

191
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,485
a major city           
         on the west coast.

192
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,954
Of course,             
         it was more authentic

193
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,590
before mr. Peterson        
     accidentally ate la jolla.

194
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,343
Uh, here comes sammy.

195
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,878
Hide the map, woody.   
         I'll hide the cities.

196
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,650
Hey, woody,                    
 what you got there?

197
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,151
Nothin'. Nothin'.

198
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,437
If you think                
    it's some map

199
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,406
of all the fun places          
 miss howe's gone               
 with that rich guy,

200
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,040
you're way                     
 off the beam.

201
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,277
Woody.

202
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,878
It was bound to come out.

203
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:37,531
He'd smell                     
 the whole west coast           
 on your breath, mr. Peterson.

204
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,736
Guys, guys, guys. Come on,  
    you can talk about rebecca  
    having a good time

205
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,954
all you want.              
     It's no skin off my nose.

206
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,573
Are you sure                   
 you aren't still repressing?

207
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,341
You know, just, uh, a bit.

208
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,409
All right,          
            maybe a little bit.

209
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,344
I mean, it doesn't seem fair.  
 Does it?

210
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,680
I spent 3 years

211
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,249
loosening the cap on    
        that peanut butter jar,

212
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,218
and right now,             
     she's--she's sticking to

213
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,286
the roof of            
         somebody else's mouth.

214
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,292
Forget about it, sammy,        
 she's yesterday's news.

215
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,479
(Sam)                      
     and here comes             
     today's edition. Hah!

216
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,431
Look at those headlines.

217
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,685
Oh, excuse me, fellas.

218
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:17,455
Whoa, whoa, who  raised 
        that bar on me?

219
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,624
You've got to admire           
 the way sammy bounces back.

220
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:22,609
He's still repressing       
    his feelings, you know.

221
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:26,080
How come i can't repress mine  
 with a girl like that?

222
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,867
Hello, everybody.          
     I'm back.

223
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,263
Notice anything new?

224
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,031
Wow, that is fantastic.

225
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,516
Thank you.

226
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:49,170
When you're done out there, 
    can you come sweep up       
    behind the bar?

227
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:50,638
Carla, carla, carla.

228
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,640
Even your bitter,              
 little east coast jokes

229
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,658
bounce right off               
 my back today.

230
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,510
Robin colcord              
     has just shown me

231
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:58,563
the most fabulous          
     3 days of my life.

232
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,164
Uh, you look great, 
            miss howe.

233
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,315
Well, i should.

234
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,185
I spent all yesterday          
 having a complete makeover.

235
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:08,038
Feel. It's the skin            
 of the rich.

236
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:11,225
Wow. Makes a baby's butt   
     feel like sandpaper.

237
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:14,829
I know. I know.

238
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:17,198
I'm a beautiful,               
 beautiful girl.

239
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,233
I feel so happy.

240
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,467
I feel like                    
 getting together

241
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,536
with my girlfriends            
 and gabbing.

242
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:26,273
Carla,                 
         you want to gab?       
     No.

243
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:28,158
You have to.   
                 I'm your boss,

244
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:32,379
and we're gonna talk about 
     my new, rich boyfriend.

245
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:34,331
So what do you  
                think of him?

246
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,987
Men are pigs.

247
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,474
Nice gabbing       
             with you, carla.

248
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,491
Hey, where's sam?

249
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,761
Uh, i think he's in 
            the pool room.

250
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:50,180
Carla, did he seem upset   
     about anything             
     while i was gone?

251
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,450
Oh, yeah. I don't know         
 when he'll get over it.

252
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:53,918
Hey, listen,               
     don't worry about it.

253
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,586
It's chalk dust.           
     It'll come off.

254
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,354
You sure?       
     Oh, yeah, yeah.

255
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:04,111
She's nice.

256
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,250
Well, hey,                  
    look who's back.

257
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,902
My god,                        
 you look fantastic.

258
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,554
I wanted to apologize to you

259
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,889
for running out on you         
 like i did.

260
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,024
Oh, yeah, that.

261
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:19,960
Well, uh, that was             
 kind of sudden, but, uh,

262
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:22,897
we all managed around here.    
 And i just hope you had        
 a good time.

263
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:26,517
No, sam, i mean because        
 you and i were                 
 about ready to...

264
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,619
oh, yeah.   
 And then we didn't.

265
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,571
Well, that's nothing   
         to feel sorry for.

266
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,757
No, please, sam,               
 accept my apology.

267
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,957
Well, it's no big deal.

268
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,175
Please accept my apology.

269
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:36,677
For me.                 
                 I will.

270
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,046
For you.       
 Well, don't do it for me,      
 do it for you.

271
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,731
I don't care.

272
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,917
Thank you for ruining          
 a perfectly wonderful day.     
                     No.

273
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,902
If it means that much, 
         then apologize.

274
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,704
Oh, i bet                      
 you'd love that.

275
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,040
How many do you         
        have to score with

276
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:52,042
before you understand  
         just one?

277
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,368
Sam, i need to                 
 talk to you.

278
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:02,903
Oh, what's up?

279
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,538
Well, it's a personal thing

280
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,641
about my relationship          
 with robin.

281
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:08,709
I haven't told anybody,

282
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,745
but i need somebody            
 to talk to.

283
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,731
Oh, no. He--he's married,      
 isn't he?

284
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,300
No.

285
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,118
Gay?               
            No, no, no.

286
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,038
Well, what is it?       
        You can tell me.

287
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,239
All right.

288
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,275
I--i think                     
 it has something               
 to do with this.

289
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:36,337
[Gasping]

290
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,008
i hope that was a dream.

291
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:52,853
Then all of a sudden,

292
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,505
she reaches down       
         to her neck,

293
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,440
and she peels off  
             her face,

294
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,942
and there's al, here.

295
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,299
And i woke up      
             in a cold sweat.

296
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,468
So you never did get to        
 finish the dream?

297
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,987
No. I was awake 
                by then,

298
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:12,055
so i switched on   
              <i>movies till dawn.</i>

299
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,525
They were showing              
 that one with buddy hackett    
 and the ducks,

300
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,661
so, of course i was up for     
 the rest of the night then.

301
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,747
So, uh, sam,    
                do you remember

302
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,115
anything else      
             about the dream?

303
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,283
(Sam)              
             oh, that was       
             the eeriest thing.

304
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,619
I mean, it was real,   
         you know, vivid,       
         like your...

305
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:26,954
like real life.

306
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,990
Sammy, that's                  
 a premonition dream.

307
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,691
That means                     
 it's really gonna happen.

308
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh, carla,                 
     that's an old wives' tale.

309
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:34,428
I'm an old wife.

310
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,816
I know about                
    these things.

311
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,835
Rebecca is gonna tell          
 sammy that something           
 ain't right

312
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:43,103
between her                    
 and daddy-big-bucks.

313
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:44,288
Really?         
     Yeah.

314
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,506
Wow.

315
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,191
Oh, please.

316
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,127
Well, now, carla may have      
 a point there.

317
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:53,263
Excuse me, while i         
     was blinking, did we all   
     just suddenly time travel

318
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,466
back to the age 
                of the druids?

319
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,953
I'm not saying                 
 the dream was psychic.

320
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,821
But perhaps                    
 your subconscious mind

321
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:02,723
has observed                   
 something subtle

322
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,592
between rebecca                
 and robin colcord

323
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:05,843
that disturbs you.

324
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,012
Well, i know how               
 to find out right now.

325
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,714
Sammy, give me some of         
 your fingernail clippings.

326
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:13,884
I'll have madame mazora        
 burn them and inhale them

327
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,003
while she's in a trance.

328
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,973
Oh, take lilith along.

329
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,259
The 3 of you           
         can gather round       
         the kettle and stir.

330
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,664
Well, doctor,

331
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,599
with regards to                
 dream analysis,

332
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,768
what do your 2 less years      
 of schooling tell you?

333
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,056
Modern dream theory 
            suggests, sam,

334
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,425
that dreams are not 
            what they seem      
            to be about at all,

335
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:40,060
but rather about       
         the dreamer himself.

336
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:41,628
You have not        
            been dreaming about

337
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,330
rebecca howe       
             and robin colcord,

338
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:45,399
you've been dreaming about 
     sam malone.

339
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:46,467
[Scoffs]

340
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,307
wait a minute.     
             Then why was it    
             so scary?

341
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,045
Well,               
            perhaps your dreams

342
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,980
are trying to tell you 
         about something

343
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,682
too frightening        
         for your waking life.

344
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:03,617
(Sam)      
                     like what?

345
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,586
Well, like you care.

346
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,337
You care about rebecca.

347
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:10,173
Oh, come on, frasier,  
         you know me.

348
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,876
How--how can i care        
     about her?

349
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:15,846
We haven't done    
             the main thing     
             i care about.

350
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:17,814
Forgive me, sam.

351
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:21,635
I forgot about             
     your high moral standards.

352
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:23,904
You mean to say                
 that you can't care            
 about a woman

353
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,973
unless you sleep               
 with her first?

354
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,509
Well, yeah.

355
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,732
I got this, kind of, uh,       
 you know, caring mechanism

356
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,933
that only gets switched on

357
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,369
by a naked trip        
         to the love zoo.

358
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,574
You're kidding?

359
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,976
Well, all right,       
         it don't always get    
         switched on,

360
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,812
i mean, sometimes       
        i go to bed with a babe

361
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,731
and find out i don't care, 
     but by then, who cares?

362
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,866
Lovely.

363
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,685
Oh, come on, lilith,       
     don't get me wrong.

364
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,921
If i do care,              
     i'm as loyal as a dog.

365
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:59,407
"Dog" would be                 
 the right term, yes.

366
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,659
Hah!

367
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,493
Care about rebecca.

368
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,961
[Scoffs]

369
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,913
hey, sam, you know,

370
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,299
norm and i've been             
 talking here                   
 and we've come up with, uh,

371
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,935
with a third possible          
 interpretation                 
 of that dream.

372
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,036
Yeah, what's that?

373
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,805
You don't want rebecca,        
 you want al.

374
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,562
I think we can 
                 safely rule    
                 that one out.

375
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:22,563
Amen.

376
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:35,559
(Cliff)                        
 hey!

377
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,244
Sorry. Sorry.

378
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:39,830
Sammy, what is the matter      
 with you?

379
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,732
You almost hit cliff.       
                 I'm sorry.

380
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,001
Yeah, if you'd just put        
 a little bit more              
 top spin on it,

381
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,869
you'd have had him.

382
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:50,674
Carla, i think         
         i care about rebecca.

383
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,793
Kill me right now, sam.

384
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,879
Just drive this pool cue       
 right through my heart.

385
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,881
Do you know how many years     
 it has taken me

386
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,617
to get over                 
    that horrible thing         
    you had with...

387
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,685
with--                     
                 diane.

388
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,487
Shut up, shut up, please!

389
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,192
I beg you,                     
 don't do this to me again!

390
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,861
Hey, i don't like it   
         any more than you do.

391
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,229
But there it is.

392
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:13,597
It's all right, sam.

393
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,332
It's gonna be ok.

394
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,934
At least                       
 you've taken the first step.

395
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:21,137
Admitting you have             
 the problem is half the cure.

396
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:24,007
What am i gonna do?

397
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,076
We'll move to vegas,

398
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:26,994
and i'll be                
     your love slave.

399
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,112
Don't worry. I--i'll be ok.

400
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:32,148
You're not gonna mope, 
         are you?

401
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
No, no. I'll be ok.

402
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:34,584
I'll get over it.          
     I'll be fine.

403
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,453
Oh, the moper's anthem.

404
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,555
Look, sammy,           
         forget about her.

405
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,658
I mean even if you do,     
     gag, care for her,

406
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,960
it's too late.

407
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,362
Oh, i know, i mean,            
 i can't compete with that guy.

408
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,949
He's the first man         
     she's gone to bed with     
     in 3 years.

409
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:50,768
She's gonna think          
     he invented sex.

410
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:51,985
That's right.

411
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:53,854
Look, you've given it          
 your best shot.

412
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,689
Now just get on            
     with your life.

413
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,508
No but see that's it,  
         i haven't really       
         given it my best shot.

414
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,094
I mean, yeah,      
             i flirted with her

415
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,963
and i had her       
            up against the wall 
            a couple of times,

416
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,332
but i never really     
         walked up and said,

417
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,984
"rebecca, i care."

418
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,035
Please, sam, i just ate.

419
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:11,971
Maybe that's what  
             she's waiting for.

420
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,407
Maybe she's waiting    
         for some guy

421
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,642
to come up and say, 
            "i care."

422
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,779
Well, i could do that.         
 I think.

423
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,114
Yeah, i--i care.

424
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:23,083
I--i care.

425
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,035
How does that sound?   
 I don't know,

426
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,705
it was drowned out by          
 the sound of                   
 my flesh crawling.

427
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,124
I'll tell you,         
         that--that english guy 
         doesn't care for her.

428
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:33,627
I'll tell you that,    
         i mean she's just      
         another fling to him.

429
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,630
But that's the advantage   
     i have, i can walk         
     right up to her and say--

430
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,031
don't say it again!

431
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,151
Look, if you're gonna do it,   
 just shut up and do it.

432
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,902
Ok? Get it over with.

433
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:44,071
If we're lucky,                
 she'll just say buzz off,

434
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:46,723
and if by some remote,         
 unlikely chance

435
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,158
she cares back,

436
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,026
just don't even bother         
 to chalk it up,

437
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,329
put it right through           
 my heart.

438
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,967
Yeah. Thank you.   
             Thank you, carla.

439
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,536
Ok. Yeah.                   
    All right.

440
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,372
Men aren't pigs.

441
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,174
Pigs are smarter.

442
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:10,114
And, uh,                       
 this is frank's design         
 for the main tower.

443
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:12,482
Oh, it's just beautiful.

444
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,685
And, um, since i have you      
 to thank for it,

445
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,820
i have you                 
     to thank for it.

446
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,975
[Gasps]

447
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:24,411
it's the same building         
 on a necklace.

448
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,646
And all the windows 
            are diamonds.

449
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:29,716
And there are       
            so many windows.

450
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:31,885
Oh!

451
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,639
Oh, you're welcome.

452
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,524
Now, i'll call you             
 when i get back                
 from zurich.

453
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:38,926
Will you miss me?

454
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,761
I'll fax you               
     every day.

455
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:41,712
Oh.

456
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,814
Oh.                     
                     Oh.

457
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:44,981
Excuse me.                     
                    Hello, sam.

458
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:46,684
I see the grenadine 
            came out nicely.

459
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,852
Uh, no, actually,          
     this is, uh, a new shirt,

460
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,554
it just looks like 
             the old one.

461
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,989
Yes. That's, um,               
 uh, very clever.

462
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:59,112
Did you want    
                something, sam?

463
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,280
Uh,

464
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,016
yes. I, uh,

466
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,522
there's something              
 i want to tell you, um...

467
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,041
uh, i'm sorry i haven't        
 told you this sooner,

468
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,445
but i haven't realized this    
 myself until just now,

469
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,080
and if i don't             
     tell you now,

470
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,232
i may miss                 
     the opportunity.

00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,935
[Knock on door]

00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,587
oh, uh, rebecca,

473
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,089
i just wanted to tell you      
 that i care for you

474
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:29,026
very, very deeply.

475

[Exclaiming]

476
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,841
that guy.

477
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,611
Do you know        
             how long i waited

478
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,680
to hear someone 
                say that?

479
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,285
Oh, i'm sorry, sam. 
            Did--did...

480
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,320
you wanted to say  
             something to me.

481
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:58,455
Yes, um,

482
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:01,608
we're out of beer nuts,

483
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,278
and i'm sorry that             
 i didn't tell you sooner.

484
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:08,114
Uh, if i had,                  
 maybe we'd have beer nuts.

485
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,703
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

486
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:16,990
You know, i didn't think    
    men like him still existed.

487
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,759
I mean, he can care 
            about a woman

488
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,261
even when              
         he hasn't gone to...

489
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,215
gone to what?

490
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:27,768
Nothing.

491
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,070
You two haven't gone to...

492
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:31,888
paris or taiwan,

493
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,808
or any other place         
     where young lovers go.

494
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,160
You two haven't                
 gone to bed together.

495
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:40,129
We have, too.      
             Many, many times,

496
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:41,532
and it was fantastic.

     didn't bother you?

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,727
i can't believe this,       
    you didn't go               
    to bed together.

504
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:56,329
Why not?

505
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,898
What's wrong?                  
 Is--is he married?             
                 No.

506

Is he gay?                     
                 No.

You're not going               
 to peel your face off,         
 are you?

508
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,754
I can't believe this.

509
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,391
Of course,                     
 i know why you didn't          
 go to bed with him.

510
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,159
Because everytime you're with  
 mr. Wonderful,                 
 you're thinking,

511
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:12,161
"i should really be        
     with my dream man."

513
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,965
Wrong! The timing  
             just wasn't right.

514
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,285
Yeah, because of me.    
 No, because of circumstance.

 know why, mr. Smarty pants...

you know, isn't it funny how   
 whenever you think of me,

520
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,347
the word "pants"               
 pops out of your mouth?

that he'll leave me!

And then i'll be stuck     
     right back where i was.

 that would be with...
