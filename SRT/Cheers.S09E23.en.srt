2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,000
         Good morning.          

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,800
            Morning.            

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,800
What's with the vegetables?     

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,200
              Same as always--  

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
            they're watching TV.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,500
  Sam, I have changed my diet.  

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,100
    I'm finally eating right    
for the first time in 30 years. 

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,500
            30? What were you   
             doing the other 12?

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,400
    And I feel so good          
         that I thought         

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,800
 we can all work on our diets.  

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,400
        So I'm making up        
  this little vegetable plate.  

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
And I figure if those guys      
 are gonna sit around and eat,  

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,700
    they might as well          
     eat something healthy.     

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
         I don't think          
    they're gonna like this.    

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,000
 Oh, they'll never even notice. 

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,900
         What the hell is this?!

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
            What's wrong?       

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,700
              This <i>thing</i> I found
            in the pretzel bowl.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,200
                Oh, my God,     
                 what are these?

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,600
    They appear to be orange    
    and green sticks.           

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,100
                          CLIFF:
        I know what they are.   
              You know, when you

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
go in a restaurant              

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,100
and you order a nice,           
big, thick, juicy steak         

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,500
and they put this other         
stuff on the plate              
that you shove aside?           

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,700
    Oh, you mean vegetables?    

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,200
                      They can't
                  be vegetables.

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
              There's no batter.

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
        You guys,               

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,900
you're not even                 
giving me a chance.             

31
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,900
Now, you sit around             

32
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,400
and you stuff your faces        
all day long,                   

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,600
so why don't you stuff them     

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,900
with something                  
that's good for you?            

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,300
    Go ahead. Try it.           

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Yeah, it's not bad.             

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,800
                Yeah. No, try   
                the cauliflower.

38
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,000
        It acts like a ladle.   

39
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,000
      (theme song begins)       

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,500
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,800
 Takes everything you've got  

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,400
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,900
 Sure would help a lot         

44
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,800
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,700
   Sometimes you want to go    

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,500
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

47
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,600
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,500
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,900
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,000
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,900
   People are all the same     

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,100
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,000
          Whoa! Sammy.          

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,200
        I see her.              

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
             How do you do that?

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,000
I could tell you, but then      
  I'd have to kill you, Norm.   

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,100
     Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh...

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,500
             Come over here for 
             a second, will you?

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
              I want to pour you
        a glass of champagne.   

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,900
            Interesting thing   
              about this bottle:

63
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,200
          it was presented to me

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,000
        for being the hottest   
        single guy in Boston,   

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,500
        but, you know, until you
    walked through that door,   

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
    I have never found anyone   
      I wanted to share it with.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,700
    I don't drink champagne.    

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,600
                     Thanks.    

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
        Whoo! What just         
      happened here, guys?      

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
                Well, you got   
                 shot down, Sam.

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
     Uh, you know, you read     

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
about those kind of things      

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
      but you never think       
  they're gonna happen to <i>you.</i>  

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,900
                        NORM:   
                 Well, you know,

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,700
                 maybe she's    
            seeing someone else.

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,700
          I don't see           
      how that's relevant.      

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,500
You know, Sammy, maybe          
she's one of these women        

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
who, uh, coaches basketball     
and does her own carpentry,     

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,100
if you know what I mean.        

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,900
      Let's go with that,       
      shall we, gentlemen?      

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,900
        Afternoon, all.         

82
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Hey, how's it going, Dr. Crane? 

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,100
Oh, the usual. The crying,      
the tantrums, the bed-wetting.  

84
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,200
                    Yeah. That's
                    fatherhood. 

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,500
  No, that's my therapy group.  

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,100
    What a bunch of losers.     

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,300
    And I'm sorry. You know,    
 I'm just a bit stressed today. 

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,100
 Lilith and I have been looking 
 for a preschool for Frederick. 

89
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Tomorrow we've got an interview 
    with the administrators     

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
    of the Magic Hours          
        Learning Center.        

91
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,300
                You know, I     
                 don't get that.

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,100
            Now, this is your   
            kid, your money--   

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,900
                why aren't <i>you</i>  
              interviewing <i>them?</i>

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,200
        Well, the beauty        
of private education, Sam,      

95
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,800
is that they're able to weed out
the unacceptable lowlifes.      

96
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,700
I just pray I'm not one of them.

97
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,100
                Wa-wa-wa-wa-wait
                 a second here. 

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,800
        Uh, what's the matter   
        with public school?     

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,300
        I went to public school.

100
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
    I love you, Cliff.          

101
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
    Don't ever change.          

102
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,500
  Until I began eating clean,   
I never realized how good       

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,300
        a nice, dry rice cake   
                    could taste.

104
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
How can you eat                 
those, Miss Howe?               

105
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,800
They don't have                 
any flavor.                     
                      Oh.       

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,500
            If I eat these, I   
            will live longer.   

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, I have a question.        

108
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,000
You know how                    
you're always talking           

109
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,000
 about how you hate your life?  

110
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,400
    How come you want           
    to make it longer?          

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
                 Shut up, Woody.

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,900
        Hello, Frasier.         

113
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,600
            Darling.            

114
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,500
                What's wrong?   
             You look so somber.

115
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
How can you tell?               

116
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
  I took a shot and got lucky.  

117
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,500
Frasier, I have some bad news.  

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,400
This morning-- at 9:00--        

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,200
Whitey passed away.             

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
                     Oh, Lilith.

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,100
              Oh.               

122
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,100
CRANE:                          
I'm so sorry.                   

123
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Just yesterday, he was          
so young, so vital.             

124
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
     This morning               
I walked into the lab           

125
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,500
and found him facedown in       
his nest of cedar shavings.     

126
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,100
                      Excuse me?

127
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
            You see, Whitey     

128
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
        was Lilith's senior,    

129
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
          and most cherished,   
                lab rat.        

130
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
            Aw, gee!            

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
          (grumbling)           

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,300
No, you don't understand.       

133
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,600
Usually we don't get            
attached to the rats,           

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,500
but this one was so special.    

135
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
  We even named him.            

136
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,500
  Everyone in the lab           
  called him Whitey.            

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Are you sure they               
weren't talking to you?         

138
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,700
    No, Carla. They were talking
        about Whitey the rat.   

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,100
Okay, I'll ask again.           

140
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,600
Are you sure they               
weren't talking to you?         

141
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,700
Carla, please!                  

142
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Lilith is mourning the          
loss of a close friend.         

143
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,500
            What's the big deal?

144
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,700
         You go find another rat

145
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,400
                to hook up to   
                your electrodes.

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,500
My research never harmed Whitey 
          in any way.           

147
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,300
        In fact, he had         
  everything a rat could want.  

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,700
  If he needed it,              
  I gave it to him.             

149
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,400
That rat was the envy of others.

150
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,500
 You know, that's true,         
but I got over it.              

151
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
    I miss him so much.         

152
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,400
         (sobs)                 

153
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,200
Let it out, darling.            

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,500
         I am.                  

155
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,700
     Ooh... Here she comes.     

156
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
 Ho-ho. I'm psyched this time.  
          I'm psyched.          

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Hi. Listen, excuse me           
for just a second here.         

158
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,600
I, I didn't mean                
to, you know, imply             

159
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,500
that I was gonna give you       
the champagne to get you drunk. 

160
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,400
I just wanted to...             
get to know you.                

161
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,900
              You'd have to get 
              me drunk for that.

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,500
                            Ooh!

163
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,400
     First that other girl,     
      now her twin sister.      

164
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,500
I don't know what she's         
looking for in life,            

165
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,100
     but, well, if she          
     can't find it here,        

166
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,800
        she's not gonna         
    find it anywhere.           

167
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
        Paul! You ready?        

168
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,400
        Yeah, let's go.         

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,200
             Paul?              

170
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,000
See you later, guys.            

171
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,300
      Don't wait up.            

172
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,200
      You know, this isn't      
    really happening.           

173
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
        No, no, no, no.         

174
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,500
    In a few seconds,           
    I'm gonna wake up           

175
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
in my own bed covered in sweat. 

176
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
    Okay, here we go.           

177
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
    Ooh, this is gonna          
         be a long one.         

178
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,700
         I feel great.          

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,700
     I've been eating clean     
        for 12 hours now        

180
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
     and I feel like I have     
    a whole new body.           

181
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
 I have more energy,            

182
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
and I-I just feel better.       

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
I'm a celebration of life.      

184
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
         Boy, I'll say, Rebecca,

185
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,300
            and what goes better
             with a celebration 

186
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
                than... Ho-Hos? 

187
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,800
Well... Well, Norm,             
I-I can't think                 

188
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
of anything except,             
maybe... Twinkies.              

189
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,100
        Gentlemen,              
    I have one word for you:    

190
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,200
        Snowballs.              

191
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,400
             Snowballs!         
                      Snowballs!

192
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Snowballs are better            
because they're bite-size.      

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,100
            Good evening, all.  

194
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,100
     Sam, Glenlivet rocks.      

195
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,300
Two.                            
        How you feeling         
         there, Lilith?         

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,100
Life goes on, Sam.              

197
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,100
     Ah, that's the spirit.     

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Rather than brood and mourn,    

199
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Frasier and I have              
decided to do something         

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
a little bit more               
life-affirming.                 

201
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
We're going to a theater        
and a late dinner.              

202
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
I think Whitey                  
would approve.                  

203
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
REBECCA:                        
Lilith, your clinic's           

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
 on the phone. I think there's  

205
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,000
          an emergency          
with one of your patients.      

206
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,200
                     You can use
                     the phone  

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,500
             in my office.      
Thank you.                      

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,900
    Well, we-we've got          
        an 8:00 curtain.        

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Tell them to take two Thorazine 
  and call you in the morning.  

210
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
            That'll be $7.50,   
                      Dr. Crane.

211
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Oh, yes, of course.             

212
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600
Oh, gee, I-I've                 
only got big bills.             

213
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,000
      Well, perhaps Lilith      
        has some change.        

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
         Oh, dear God.          

215
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,400
What? What is it?               

216
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,300
    Lilith is carrying          
    a dead rat in her purse.    

217
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,200
                    Oh.         

218
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,500
Why would she be carrying       
    a dead rat in her purse?    

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,400
              Just a wild guess.

220
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,800
                     A snack?   

221
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,800
  This is not healthy at all.   

222
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,000
        My wife has gone        
  completely around the bend.   

223
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
      Perhaps I rushed her      
  through the grieving process  

224
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
              too quickly. Oh...
             Oh, the poor woman.

225
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,700
              I dare you to look
                in the purse.   

226
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,100
Ha! Dare me? Dare you.          

227
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,300
      You know, obviously,      
 I've got to dispose of Whitey  

228
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
      break this fixation,      

229
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,400
then deal with the repercussions
         as they occur.         

230
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,700
         Eww.                   
                        Eww.    

231
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,700
Yeah, I looked first.           

232
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,300
    I bet you won't kiss him.   

233
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
    You two are sick!           

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
             Oh, yeah. We've got
            a big problem.      

235
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,100
Obviously, Lilith               
is having trouble               

236
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,600
breaking this attachment        
on her own.                     

237
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,700
     I've got to be the man     

238
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
        and handle this         
      in a mature fashion.      

239
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,900
    Eww, eww, eww, eww! Eww!    

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
    Is everything all right?    

241
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
      Yes, it was a false alarm.

242
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,700
        So nothing was wrong?   

243
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,700
No. One of my patients          
set off a false alarm,          

244
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,700
but he's a pyromaniac, so,      
for him, this is progress.      

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,300
Oh, Lilith, darling. Hello.     

246
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
I've, I've got your purse.      

247
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,700
Uh, you know, we don't have time
for our drinks, really.         

248
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
    Uh, th-the curtain's        
    in 45 minutes               

249
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
    and you know                
  how I hate to be late.        

250
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
        Yes. It's one of your   
     more endearing compulsions.

251
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,900
        Uh, by the way, uh...   

252
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
             there's something  
             we need to discuss.

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
            You did what?!      

254
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,200
         Darling, I did         
    what I had to do!           

255
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,800
        Shut up! Where is he?   

256
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
     (trash cans rattling)      

257
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
          Apparently,           
     she's still grieving!      

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,100
Well, 26 hours of eating clean. 

259
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,300
                    And 26 hours
            of hearing about it.

260
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,500
    Oh, good morning there.     
      Did you sleep okay?       

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,700
              Not too well, Sam.

262
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,500
      You know, I'd have thought
                that that couch,

263
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,800
        after all the acrobatics
        you've done on it, would
        have a little more give.

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
                But I appreciate
            your hospitality.   

265
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,900
Anytime, Fras.                  

266
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,800
    You know, I guess           
  I ought to freshen up, huh?   

267
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,200
This is what it's come to.      

268
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,600
     Bedding down in a bar,     

269
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,900
    wearing the same clothes    
     for two days in a row.     

270
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,200
                     Yeah, well,
                the trick, Fras,

271
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,700
                 is to take your
    sport coat off like that.   
        Yeah?                   

272
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,500
        and stand directly under
    the air conditioning duct   

273
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,700
                for about, uh...
                    ten minutes.

274
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,400
                Take it from me,
                 if you do that,

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
              you can go another
            couple days easy.   

276
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,300
         Are you saying         
     that you sometimes go      

277
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
    for days at a time          
      in the same clothes?      

278
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,600
        Oh, yeah, you get a look
             that works for you,

279
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,100
              you stick with it.

280
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
    (laughing):                 
    Oh, Paul.                   

281
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
      Why is she laughing?      

282
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
    Paul's not funny.           

283
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
    (laughing)                  

284
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,400
Does anyone know what           
Paul does for a living?         

285
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,200
After all, women are            
attracted to power.             

286
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,600
                Uh, I think he's
          a tollbooth attendant.

287
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,900
        Yep, well, that would   
    explain the quarter tips.   

288
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,900
I think I know what it is.      

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,300
     Paul's a real nice guy     
      and a good listener.      

290
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
He probably shows               
a genuine interest              

291
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
in who she is                   
as a person.                    

292
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,800
Probably treats her             
with respect.                   

293
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
    Well, if that's the case,   
            he's welcome to her.

294
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
  Well, is there anything here  
I can have for breakfast?       

295
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,700
If you'd like something         
that's tasty and nutritious,    

296
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
you could spread                
some of this,                   

297
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,800
     uh, bean curd on these     
fiber-rich bran crackers.       

298
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,900
     I won't eat that crap.     

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Frasier, you're a doctor.       

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
    You should believe          
    in health and nutrition.    

301
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
 Doesn't mean I have to listen  

302
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,900
     to some tree-hugging,      
      dirt-munching Druid.      

303
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,000
    I'm sorry.                  

304
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I'm not exactly what            
you'd call a morning person.    

305
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,700
  Dr. Crane, your wife called.  
I didn't want to wake you.      

306
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,500
  Oh. She called to apologize?  

307
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,800
         Well, sort of.         

308
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,700
Uh, she said for you to meet her
     at Frederick's school.     

309
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,900
You have that interview.        

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
        Oh, I completely forgot.
      Well, she also said       

311
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,900
          to tell you           
     she knew you'd forget      

312
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,700
      because "you're such      
    an uncaring human being.    

313
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
                "But for once   

314
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
         "in your life,         
      think of your child,      

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,100
 "comb your few remaining hairs 

316
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,000
"and wash that canned ham       
        you call a face         

317
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
            and get over there."

318
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,900
You know, now that I reread this

319
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,300
    it sounds less and less     
        like an apology.        

320
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
    Say, uh, Sammy, could I have
             a couple of coffees

321
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,100
    for me and Paula?           

322
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,300
    Paul and Paula?             

323
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
            Yeah.               

324
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,600
    Hey, Paul?                  

325
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,500
             What?              

326
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
         No, the song, you know,
                    "Hey, Paul."

327
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,000
    Hey, what?                  

328
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,400
CLIFF:                          
No, wait a minute.              

329
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,700
You never heard of that old     
song, "Hey, hey, Paul?"         

330
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,200
         Hey, hey, shut up.     

331
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
            No, no, no, come on.

332
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
             We're talking about
         that song from the '60s

333
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,700
              by Paul and Paula,
              "Hey, hey, Paula."

334
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,500
             What?              

335
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,900
Nothing. Never mind.            

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
Forget I brought it up.         

337
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,500
Hey, this has been              
driving me crazy.               

338
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,500
I gotta know                    
something here, Paul.           

339
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,700
            What, Sam?          

340
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, I'll try to put this      
    as delicately as I can,     

341
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,600
    because you're my friend    
        and I like you,         

342
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,300
and I don't want to insult you, 

343
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,800
     but why would any girl     
    be caught dead with you     

344
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
when she could be with me?      

345
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,400
                You thought that
                would offend me?

346
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,100
          I'm serious.          

347
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,300
  I mean, what'd you do, slip   
her a mickey or something?      

348
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
      Well since you asked me so
     nicely, Sam, I'll tell you.

349
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,400
 Paula is what we like to refer 
     to as a chubby-chaser.     

350
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,600
        You're kidding.         

351
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,900
You mean, she likes             
to go out                       

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,200
      with guys who are...      
         who are, uh...         

353
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
                    Portly, Sam.
        The word is "portly."   

354
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,300
    Did you hear that?          

355
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,600
            She only goes out   
        with guys who are heavy.

356
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,300
Well, you'd be                  
surprised, Sam.                 

357
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,000
Women like the                  
oddest things.                  

358
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
     Take me.                   

359
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,400
         Yeah? What do you like?

360
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,200
Nothing. Just take me.          

361
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,600
SAM:                            
This is driving me crazy.       

362
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,900
    I've gotta fin...           

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
    Excuse me. Listen.          

364
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Apparently, you've been,        
you know, shooting me down here 

365
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,300
for the last couple of days     
because of the way I look.      

366
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,100
              So?               

367
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,600
I think it's unfair             

368
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
    that you're not willing     
  to get to know the real me.   

369
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,500
I think if you did, we could be 
      really good friends.      

370
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
    You want to be friends?     

371
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,900
          Yeah, I do.           
                        Yeah?   

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
            Okay, well, maybe   
                  we could start

373
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,500
        by you introducing me   
        to some of your friends.

374
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,800
    Especially that large and   
    lovely one right over there.

375
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,300
    You mean Norm?              

376
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,700
        Yeah. He's a suitful,   
                    isn't he?   

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
         Oh, thank God.         

378
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,400
         I didn't miss          
     the interview, did I?      

379
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
         Yes, you did.          
      I've already had it.      

380
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,900
                 They're outside
        conferring about us now.

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,300
     What did you tell them     
        about me?               

382
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,800
        I described you in terms

383
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,000
        which were positively   
                        glowing,

384
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
    which is the way I'd like   
             to see you in hell.

385
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,300
                So just remember

386
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,600
          when they come back in
                 to pretend that
             we love each other.

387
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,900
          After that, I go right
        back to loathing you.   

388
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,300
I can't believe that you're     
willing to destroy our marriage 

389
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
all because of                  
your childish refusal           

390
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
to accept the death             
of an animal.                   

391
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,700
    The very fact that you think
        of Whitey as "an animal"

392
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,500
              proves that we are
        completely incompatible.

393
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,100
     But he was an animal!      

394
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,800
  Well, what-what-what was he?  

395
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,500
A... a... a vegetable?          
A mineral?                      

396
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,100
Oh, I know, he was the          
CEO of General Motors.          

397
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,900
                    I hate you. 

398
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,700
          I hate you!           

399
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,600
                Hello.          
        Hello.                  

400
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,300
             This is my husband,

401
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
              Dr. Frasier Crane.

402
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,100
He's very sorry he's late,      

403
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
but he's always so              
busy helping people.            

404
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
            Pleased to meet you.

405
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,600
             Won't you sit down?

406
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,400
                And we'd like   
                    to thank you

407
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,800
             for taking the time
              to come down here.

408
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,900
        It's good to see parents
              that care so much.

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
             You know, a program

410
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,900
      like ours requires as much
    of the parents as the child.

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,200
We couldn't agree more.         

412
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Right, dear?                    

413
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,800
        Oh, absolutely, dear.   

414
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,500
Unofficially, I think it's      
a very good possibility         

415
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,200
that we'll be able              
to welcome Frederick            

416
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,700
to the Magic Hours              
Learning Center.                

417
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,200
      Oh, that's wonderful news.

418
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,000
We couldn't be happier.         

419
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,500
          But before you leave--

420
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,900
        would you like to see   
             something precious?

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,600
                      Our Sylvia

422
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
                just had babies.

423
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
             Well, who's Sylvia?

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,800
The school's pet hamster.       

425
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,100
        Oh.                     

426
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,800
  Oh, look at that little one   
         in the corner.         

427
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,800
He looks just like Whitey.      

428
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,400
                Who's Whitey?   

429
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,300
     Oh, he was my favorite     
            dead rat            

430
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,600
     that this bastard took     
    and threw in the trash!     

431
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,100
        Don't mind her.         

432
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,900
She's just overemotional,       

433
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,500
and crazy as a loon!            

434
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
      I suppose you'd like      
      to take one of these      

435
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,800
          and throw it          
      in the garbage, too?      

436
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Here, why don't you just bite   
the heads off these birds       

437
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
while you're at it,             

438
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,400
        Dr. Death?              

439
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,100
        I am not the one        
    who goes walking around     

440
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,900
     with the decomposing corpse
        of a rat in my purse.   

441
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
You're a hateful man.           

442
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,600
         And you are a troubled,
                disturbed woman.

443
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,900
    But a wonderful mother.     

444
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,300
    Well, we'll get back to you.

445
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,100
Well, Sam, I've done it.        

446
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,300
    Blighted my child's hopes   

447
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,800
 of ever getting an education,  

448
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,200
      and probably ruined       
      my marriage as well.      

449
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,100
    I think my life is over.    

450
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
      Yeah, well, life is tough.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
         I just got shot down by
     a chick who likes fat guys.

452
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,000
        Oh, Rebecca, do you have
any more of those rice cakes?   

453
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,200
    Why?                        

454
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
        Well, you were right.   

455
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
    They're the perfect food.   

456
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Yeah, what's the gag?           

457
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
            No, I'm telling you,
             we've been enjoying
            them all day, right?

458
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,100
            You bet.            

459
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,100
    Really?                     
                    Yeah.       

460
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
Well, that's neat.              

461
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm glad I could make you guys, 
you know, feel better.          

462
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,300
Yeah, I've got a whole new bag  
of them right down here.        
                     Great.     

463
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,100
You guys are gonna feel         
so much healthier               
when you eat like this.         

464
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
        I'm not kidding.        
 You'll have a lot more energy. 

465
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,500
 Your bodies will feel lighter. 
 Your reflexes will be sharper. 

466
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,900
    Oh, our reflexes are already
              much, uh, sharper.

467
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
                    Carla, pull.

468
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
                        Pull.   

469
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,800
            Frasier.            

470
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Frasier, I owe you              
an apology.                     

471
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,700
I haven't been myself           
the past couple of days.        

472
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,000
              No, darling.      

473
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,300
    I, I trivialized your grief.

474
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,100
                A husband should
                  be supportive.

475
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,800
         But, please... help me.

476
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,300
                    Help me.    

477
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
                Meet me halfway.

478
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Why were you carrying a moribund
     rodent in your evening bag?

479
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,100
I wasn't going to take          
him on our date.                

480
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,400
But I knew if I left            
him at the lab,                 

481
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,400
they'd have given him to        
the undergraduates to dissect.  

482
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,700
I couldn't let that             
happen to Whitey.               

483
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
I just wanted to give           
him a decent burial.            

484
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,800
              I'm, I'm so sorry.

485
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,500
        How could I have been   
                 so insensitive?

486
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Of course, I overreacted.       

487
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,200
But I think I know why.         

488
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
I was confronted                

489
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
for the first time              

490
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,800
with the death of               
someone close to me.            

491
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,200
             I understand, dear.

492
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,600
     It's what we call a crisis.

493
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,100
I know what we call it,         
Frasier.                        

494
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,300
The upshot is I've never        
been more acutely aware         

495
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,300
of how precious and fragile     
life is for each of us.         

496
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,100
          Well, darling, I think
            everyone would agree

497
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,000
            that existence is   
                tenuous at best.

498
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,700
        Therefore, all we can   
             do is embrace life.

499
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
                  And you and I,
             we're so fortunate.

500
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,000
             We, we have a baby,
 the very symbol of life reborn.

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Frasier, he's no longer a baby. 

502
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,700
    He'll be going to school    
         in September.          

503
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,900
 Oh, yes, if we can successfully
 negotiate a preschool interview

504
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,100
                without slipping
                    into a scene

505
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,600
            from <i>Who's Afraid</i>   
              <i>of Virginia Woolf?</i>

506
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
     But, darling, you're right.

507
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,300
     Frederick is getting older.

508
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
         You know there is a way

509
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
                  we could renew
            ourselves yet again.

510
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,200
How would we do that?           

511
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,700
    We could have another child.

512
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,500
  We could, couldn't we?        

513
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,300
That's a wonderful idea.        

514
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh, Frasier, suddenly,          
I'm filled with a glow.         

515
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Let's start right now.          

516
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,700
      It's all so strange.      

517
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,100
A seemingly insignificant       
creature lives and dies...      

518
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,900
  a marriage is threatened...   

519
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,700
      a child's education       
     is almost destroyed...     

520
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,400
     yet, somehow, someway,     

521
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,300
    I'm getting some action     
        out of it.              

522
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:36,659
