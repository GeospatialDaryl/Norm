    Cheers <i>is filmed before</i>     
     <i>a live studio audience.</i>    

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,800
      Anybody seen my gum?      

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,200
        Left it around          
          here somewhere.       

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,800
                 What'd you take
            your gum out for?   

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,800
    To give my mouth a rest,    
        you know.               

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,300
Dear Diary, today               
it finally happened.            

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
Wood, can I have another... Oh! 

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,700
             Cliff,             

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,200
                 I think I found
                    your gum.   

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,700
This is a new jacket, too, man. 

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
  Well, Norm, might I suggest   
        that you ice it         

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,300
and then try to scrape the bulk 
 of it off with a razor blade,  

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,100
    and maybe that way          
        you can save it.        

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,500
 Oh, no, that's okay, Frasier.  

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,500
    I was about to get          
      a new piece anyway.       

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Sounds like a lot of work,      
     Frasier, I don't know.     

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,200
      Well, alternatively,      
  you could wait several years  

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,500
 for the resins to break down,  

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,900
    the gum to harden           
    and fall off by itself.     

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,400
         I seem to have         
my full range of movement.      

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,100
          I can wait.           

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,900
      (theme song begins)

      in the world today

00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
 Takes everything you've got  

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
         Takin' a break        
    from all your worries      

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,900
 Sure would help a lot         

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,300
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,100
   Sometimes you want to go    

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,000
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,100
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,700
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,500
  You wanna be where everybody 
    knows your name            

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,600
   People are all the same     

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,100
  You wanna go where everybody 
    knows your name.

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
             Whoo!              

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,700
        Boy, did it just        
    get warm in here?           

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
I hate Indian summers.          

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,500
You never know what to wear     
to work in the morning.         

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,100
  I mean, it's gonna get cold,  
      it should stay cold.      

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,200
Then, who am I                  
to question the Lord?           

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
                     What's with
                      the getup?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
    It's Indian summer, Sam.    

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,300
      I need these clothes      
        for protection.         

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
        Protection from what?   

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,300
        The eyes of men.        

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,100
                    What are you
                  talking about?

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,400
Every time I've conceived a kid 
it's been during Indian Summer. 

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,900
That's when I'm at my most      
        fertile, Sammy.         

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,800
 I cannot let any man touch me, 
     talk to me or see me,      

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
  or I'll be shooting out kids  
     like a Pez dispenser.      

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,100
Oh, come on.                    

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,800
                I'm not kidding,
                          Sammy.

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,200
 I've-I've gone over two years  
now without having a kid.       

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,000
  Now that's a record for me.   

58
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
                  I'm not taking
                    any chances.

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,600
          I was gonna stay home,
            turn off the lights,

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,500
             lie down... but the
        cable man's coming over.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Sweetheart, I promise you,      

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
I won't let anybody             
put the moves on you, okay?     

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,300
            Oh, no, you don't   
              understand, Sammy.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
                  It's not them,
                        it's me.

65
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,700
    When the mercury hits 95,   

66
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,300
          I can't be responsible
                 for my actions.

67
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,300
    Oh.                         

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,500
              Oh!               

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,100
  Who is that hunk over there   

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
         in the uniform         
      with the cute buns?       

71
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,400
    Oh, my God, it's Clavin!    

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,600
            Oh, this is, this is
        worse than I thought.   

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,300
            Has he always had   
                  that mustache?

74
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
                Iced coffee will
                cool me down.   

75
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,300
                        REBECCA:
                  Hey, you guys,
                 listen to this.

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,600
 "Rumor has it that the reason  
      jillionaire jailbird      

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,900
"Robin Colcord gave up his      
      fortune and freedom       

78
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
        "was a mystery femme.   

79
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,000
     But so far our little caged
        Robin isn't singing."   

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,300
 Boy, that writer really paints 
     a picture, doesn't he?     

81
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,200
  You know, I can just picture  
     Mister Colcord sitting     

82
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,200
 on his little perch in a cage, 

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
      sharpening his beak       
    on a cuttlebone...          

84
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,500
              Woody. Woody.

Pecking away                    
at a little bell                

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,500
made out                        
of sesame seeds.                

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
    Yeah!                       
                  Sam!          

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,100
        Rebecca, this is kind   
         of a rip-off, isn't it?

89
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,800
    I mean, they don't even     
    mention your name.          

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And don't think                 
I'm not grateful.               

91
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,800
    What do you mean?           

92
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,100
  You could have been famous.   

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,800
        Yeah, s-someday         
I would like to be famous,      

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
  but not because I'm involved  
        with a rich man.        

95
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,300
I mean, I would                 
like to be known                

96
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,700
for some real                   
achievement.                    

97
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,600
    Oh, yeah. How's that cure   
    for leprosy coming along?   

98
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,300
     You know what I mean.      

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,500
  You know how the girlfriends  
      of rich millionaires      

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,800
are treated by the press;       
    like cheap sluts.           

101
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,900
You know, I think it stems      
         from the envy          

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
     that the public feels      
         towards people         

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,700
  who achieve a certain level   
         of notoriety.          

104
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Well, also the fact that most of
  those women have posed nude   

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
  in popular men's magazines.   

106
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
    But, you know, frankly,     

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,800
I wouldn't waste my money       
on publications like that.      

108
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,500
     I mean, those letters      
         are not real.          

109
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
I just hope the rag             
magazines don't find out        

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,800
that I am                       
the mystery woman.              

111
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
Who am I kidding?               

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Those bloodhounds               
will ferret me out              

113
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
the first chance                
they get.                       

114
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,200
But at least I have my dignity. 

115
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,200
         Well, I'm off to change
                  the blue stuff

116
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,500
      in the toilet bowls.      

117
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
            (sighs)             

118
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,700
        What's the matter, Wood?

119
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,300
I don't get <i>The Far Side.</i>       

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
        Woody, come on.         
    Hand it over here.          

121
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,300
            Come on.            
    Let's have a look.          

122
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, Wood, now you see         
here in the first panel,        

123
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,300
the cows are standing           
on their hind legs, right?      

124
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,400
The second panel,               
when the car goes by,           

125
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
they're acting like             
normal cows.                    

126
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,400
          See, the idea here is,
    Wood, that, uh, you know,   

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,300
         cows only act like cows
        when, when we're around.

128
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,300
            Other times they act
                    like people.

129
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
                  Now does that,
              does that help you

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
                     clear it up
        a little bit for you?   

131
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,800
          I just meant          
    I don't get <i>The Far Side</i>    

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
    in my newspaper at home,    

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,700
but thanks for treating me      
      like a one-year-old.      

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,300
Oh, every time we turn on       

135
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,100
 Robert Vaughn's                
 <i>Amazing Discoveries,</i>           

136
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,200
we always get                   
the hair-loss episode.          

137
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
I mean, it's like they,         
they never did any others.      

138
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
     Well, listen, we don't have
        to watch an infomercial.

139
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,300
                We can choose   
                  from any of 60

140
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,400
                 wonderful cable
                  stations here.

141
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,100
At the very least it's....      

142
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,800
  Well, there's Lyle Waggoner   
    talking about impotence.    

143
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,500
     Oh, people trying to whiten
             their yellow teeth.

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
         <i>Singing in the Rain.</i>   

145
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,200
      Oh, how to buy real estate
             with no money down.

146
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,800
Wait, wait, wait,               
you just passed by              

147
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,500
one of the all-time             
classics, Frasier.              

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,000
Put it back on                  
the yellow teeth one.           

149
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,400
                     Wait, wait,
                        go back.

150
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,100
             There was a picture
            of Robin Colcord.   

151
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,900
     Sources have confirmed     
          the identity          

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
  of Colcord's mystery woman.   

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,600
  Oh, God! They found me out!   

154
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,300
     Colcord's secret lover     
        revealed herself        

155
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,300
  in a press conference today   
  to be Jeanne Marie Beaulier,  

156
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,100
    Charges d'Affaires          
for the French Consulate.       

157
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,200
        Miss Beaulier...        
        Excuse me?              

158
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
I thought Robin dumped          

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
that French babe                
for you weeks ago.              

160
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,300
                Well, he did!   

161
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
            The nerve of that   
        cheap slut pretending   

162
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,500
            like Robin turned   
             himself in for her!

163
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,600
                    Don't worry,
                        Rebecca.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,900
        Your friends know who   
         the real cheap slut is.

165
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,700
Thank you, Norm.                

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,300
         Well, Rebecca,         
        don't be upset.         

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,100
     I mean, she's actually     
    doing you a favor.          

168
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,500
      You're off the hook.      

169
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,000
The press is going              
to tear her apart               

170
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
and leave your relationship     
with Robin unsullied.           

171
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,900
        I guess you're right.   

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,900
I mean, the only thing that     
really does matter is that,     

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
that I am Robin's true love.    

174
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
And it actually                 
makes it more romantic          

175
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
because we're                   
the only ones who know.         

176
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
            Yeah, except for us.

177
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,300
And I kind of told my mom       
          in Hanover.           

178
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,600
You know what I mean.           

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,500
It's sort of like               
a secret valentine              

180
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
between me and Robin.           

181
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,700
                    And us.     

182
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,200
    And my mom.                 

183
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,000
            Woody, who cares    
         if your mother knows?  

184
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
          I mean, who is she    
            going to tell?      

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Are you serious?                

186
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,000
She has choir practice tonight. 

187
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,200
Once she gets                   
a cup                           

188
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,400
    of coffee in her,           

189
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
    those old biddies           
will bleed it out of her.       

190
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,900
    For a moist crumb cake,     

191
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
      she'll tell anybody       
    why you never see           

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Uncle Willie and Aunt May       
        in the same room        

193
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,600
    at the same time.           

194
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,900
              Why, uh, why would
                  that be, Wood?

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,200
  I don't see any crumb cake.   

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,600
        (phone ringing)         

197
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,900
            Cheers.             

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,100
          Oh, hi, Mom!          

199
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,900
It's for me.                    

200
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw the news, 

201
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,600
  but don't believe everything  
         you see on TV.         

202
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,000
That French lady, Jeanne Marie, 
was telling a big whopper.      

203
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
    It was really Miss Howe     
    who was having...           

204
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,900
        well, you know,         
      with Mister Colcord.      

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,700
         Oh, all right.         
    I'm sorry. I will.          

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
                    Where're you
                    going, Wood?

207
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,100
    I have to go wash           
    my mouth out with soap.     

208
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,900
          I'm sorry, Woody.     

209
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,400
  Yeah, well, maybe next time   

210
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,000
     you'll think about the     
 consequences of your actions.  

211
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,500
        REPORTER:               
    Looks like no end           
 to the heat wave is in sight.  

212
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,100
    Today may actually break    
        a hundred.              

213
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
            Oh, man!            

214
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,400
  I'd better get the crib out   
         of the garage.         

215
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,900
         Hi, everybody.         
      I brought doughnuts.      

216
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,600
                             Oh!

217
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
     Gee, I haven't dunked      
      a doughnut in years.      

218
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,800
  Wood, give me another beer,   
        will you?               

219
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,400
          Oh, hey, did you see  
         the <i>Midnight Tattler?</i>  

220
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
                        What?   

221
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,100
              Seems that, uh,   
                Jeanne Marie    

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
        sold her love letters   
                from Robin.     

223
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,500
                  Yeah? Whoo-ee!

224
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
                Look at the legs
                 on this chick!!

225
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,300
Hey, hey, guys?                 
Guys, guys.                     

226
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Rebecca's standing              
right here.                     

227
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Try and to be                   
a little more polite.           

228
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,600
              Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
             Thank you very much

229
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,900
              for the doughnuts,
                        Rebecca.

230
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,800
                Look at the legs
                on this babe!   

231
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,100
        Are they continued on   
         the next page or what?!

232
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Don't bother, Sam.              
I've seen the article.          

233
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,100
It's just a stupid,             
pitiable act                    

234
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,500
of a desperate woman.           

235
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Those letters                   
are not real.                   

236
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,900
        They never are.         

237
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,900
Robin did not type              
those letters.                  

238
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
I have seen his typewriter.     

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,400
He doesn't even use             
that font.                      

240
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,400
        (phone ringing)         

241
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,400
                  Cheers.       

242
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,900
            Oh, hi, Mom.        

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,100
              It's for me.      

244
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,700
            Um, yeah, yeah,     
          I-I saw the article.  

245
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,900
             Miss Howe says     
        it's not even his font. 

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
                 What?          

247
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,000
            No, Mom, font       
          isn't a bad word.     

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
            No, it's not...     

249
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,500
            All right. Okay.    

250
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,800
    Thanks a lot, Miss Howe.    

251
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,600
CLIFF:                          
Hey, Sammy, how about           
turning up the sound?           

252
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
         Don't you care         
    about any of this?          

253
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
     I mean, it's got to be     
  bothering you a little bit.   

254
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,500
I wouldn't be human             

255
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
if it didn't bother me          
a little bit.                   

256
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
But, I mean, what does          
it really amount to?            

257
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
I have Robin's love             

258
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,100
and she has a couple of blurbs  
in a cheap tabloid.             

259
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,100
And it's not like she's some    
national celebrity.             

260
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,200
         ARSENIO HALL:          
  Join me tonight as the stage  
     sizzles with my guests     

261
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,400
Michael Caine, M.C. Hammer      

262
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,400
  and the woman Robin Colcord   
        gave it up for,         

263
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,100
  and I mean really gave it up  
  for, Jeanne Marie Beaulieu.   

264
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,900
    Watch her kick it           
 on the next <i>Arsenio Hall Show.</i> 

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,300
              Hey!              

266
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,700
I'm the one who should be       
          kickin' it!           

267
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
    Hey.                        

268
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
This is getting                 
very serious.                   

269
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Thank you for your concern, Sam.

270
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,000
 Do you have any idea how much  
         that TV costs?         

271
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,300
                    What?       

272
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,300
 The corporation owns this bar  
        for three years,        

273
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,400
you don't break anything.       

274
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
I have it for three weeks,      

275
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,800
     you yank my television     
         off the wall.          

276
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,000
        I'm sorry.              
  I shouldn't have done that.   

277
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,200
                  It's just that
                 I didn't expect

278
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,500
          this thing with Jeanne
        Marie to go this far.   

279
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
             Before, nobody even
              took it seriously.

280
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,400
    And all of a sudden she's   
     getting national attention.

281
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
             Tonight she's going
            to be on <i>Arsenio.</i>   

282
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Yeah, I know.                   
And thanks to you,              
I can't watch it.               

283
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,700
  Why hasn't Robin spoken out?  

284
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,500
I mean, why hasn't              
he denied this?                 

285
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,900
What if... what if he really    
does love Jeanne Marie?         

286
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,000
What would I do?                

287
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,800
                    Hey. I know.
    What?                       

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,300
            I'll get my landlady
                to tape <i>Arsenio.</i>

289
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,900
No, Sam.                        
    No, no, no, you're right,   
     you're right, you're right.

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,100
          Then I'd be obligated.

291
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,000
    Sam!                        

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
You're not listening to me.     

293
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
                Well, all right,
            I'm listening. What?

294
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
  I mean I cannot just ask him  
    if he loves Jeanne Marie    

295
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,900
because then he will think      
    that I don't trust him.     

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,900
                     You don't. 

297
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
I know, but I should.           

298
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,400
    But if I ask him,           
  "Do you love Jeanne Marie?"   

299
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
and he says "Yes," I don't think
that I could handle that.       

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,600
And if I ask him if he loved me 
    and he said "Yes,"          

301
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,700
    then he would know          
that I did not trust him.       

302
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,100
  And trusting him is the one   
 thing that I really should do  

303
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
        since he gave up        
     his fortune for me...      

304
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
        if he really did        
    give it up for me,          

305
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,300
     which I can never know     
      because I can't ask.      

306
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,300
             Let me see if I can
    put this in a nutshell...   

307
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,600
                What?           

308
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,200
 Sam, would you ask him for me? 

309
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,100
         No. No, no. No, I don't
                want to do that.

310
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,300
I've never been to prison.      

311
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,800
              Oh, well, it's not
        really a real prison.   

312
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,000
          I...                  
                  No it's like a

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,100
          minimum-security deal.

314
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,400
          It's like summer camp,

315
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,800
         only Robin has to spend
     seven to ten summers there.

316
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,700
    No, really, and when you,   
            when you see him,   

317
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
             don't tell him that
        I told you to ask, okay?

318
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,600
            I mean, just make it
        sound like, you know,   

319
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,100
             you just dropped by
            prison, you know,   

320
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,800
        it's just like a real   
            casual deal for you.

321
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,500
            Uh, no.             
    No, Rebecca, I'm sorry.     

322
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,300
                    Okay.       

323
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,900
                      Forget it.

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,300
        It's just that, um...   

325
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,100
                whenever I think

326
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,300
        that Robin might love   
         Jeanne Marie, you know,

327
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I just get so darned mad,       
        you know?               

328
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,700
 Just feel like I could just... 

329
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,500
  Okay. Okay.                   

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,500
I guess I can...                
swing by the prison,            

331
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,800
on my way to the billiards      
         supply store.          

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
        Carla, uh, watch the bar
            for me, will you?   

333
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,700
             I've got to go down
         to prison for a minute.

334
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,300
                         Prison?

335
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,500
      Isn't that where they keep
        all the bad, lonely men?

336
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,400
Now, come on, Carla.            
Don't.                          

337
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,400
    Oh, Sammy, take me          
    with you, please?           
                             No.

338
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,600
Smuggle me in                   
in your pants.                  
                     No!        

339
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,500
            Please?             
     I need a tattooed man!     

340
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
         Please, Sammy.         

341
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,900
Carla, no!                      

342
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,200
          Ah, yeah, there he is.

343
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,200
             Thanks very much.  

344
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
          Hey, Robin.           

345
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,200
Robin. Hey.                     

346
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,400
        Hey, Sam.               

347
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,600
    What are you doing here?    

348
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,500
             I, uh,             

349
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
     I need to talk to you      
         for a minute.          

350
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,900
      Oh, yeah, certainly.      

351
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,300
         Grab a racket.         

352
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,100
Oh, well, all right.            

353
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
Yes, I'd stop to talk, only...  

354
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,900
I just get three hours          
a week on the court.            

355
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,100
    Prison, you know.           

356
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Excuse me, Sam,                 

357
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
          weren't you           
    a professional athlete?     

358
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,900
  Well, yeah, I was a pitcher   
    for the American League,    

359
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,800
      but I never actually      
      had to hit anything.      

360
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,100
I see, so basically you just did
  what this machine is doing.   

361
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,800
  Yeah, but my arm got tired.   

362
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,900
     So, Sam, what have you     
    got on your mind?           

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,600
     I want to talk to you      
about your ex-girlfriend.       

364
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 Can you be, uh, more specific? 

365
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,700
The one you were running around 
  with behind Rebecca's back.   

366
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,300
Can you be more specific?       

367
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,600
         Jeanne Marie.          

368
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,500
              Oh!               

369
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,000
     Oh, dear Jeanne Marie.     

370
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,700
 Yes, I do hope her little game 
         with the press         

371
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,900
    isn't troubling Rebecca.    

372
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,900
            Yeah, well...       

373
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,200
        Yeah, it is actually.   

374
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,700
              You know this girl
            is running around   

375
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
            getting exploited   
             all over the place,

376
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
                 but we all know
            that it's Rebecca   

377
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,800
                that deserves   
                to be exploited.

378
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,700
  Hey, these things are coming  
          pretty fast.          

379
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
          Can we slow them down?

380
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Oh no, if they went any slower  
they wouldn't remain airborne.  

381
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,300
Yeah, yeah, Sam, look,          

382
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,100
if Rebecca is really            
getting troubled by this,       

383
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
why didn't she make             
mention of it to me?            

384
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,300
             Well, I don't know,
                    actually.   

385
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,800
    She, uh, tried to explain   
        that to me, but I, uh...

386
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,100
Yes, enough said.               

387
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
    Poor Rebecca.               

388
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Her insecurities have finally   
got the better of her.          

389
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,500
Well, perhaps I should, uh,     

390
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,600
make an end of Jeanne           
Marie's little charade          

391
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,300
and go to the press             
and tell them the truth.        

392
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,500
          Do you think          
      that would help her?      

393
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,300
                     Sure, yeah.

394
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
     Say, is your arm sore?     

395
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,400
What?                           
                  My arm's sore.

396
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,900
                  Right here.   
Oh, yes.                        

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, we can take               
a break if you like.            

398
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,400
                      All right.
    Maurice!                    

399
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,100
                Thanks, Maurice.

400
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,200
                    Whoo!       

401
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,300
Hey, Robin.                     

402
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Excuse me, are you through      
with the court yet?             

403
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
              Yes, Sherman.     
             It's all yours.    

404
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,400
    Thanks.                     

405
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,800
                 Maurice!       

406
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,200
      Hey, I voted for that guy.

407
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
          Okay, guys, we got it.

408
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,600
You know, I think               
Rebecca did us a favor          

409
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,900
by breaking that old TV.        

410
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
                    Yeah, I like
                     this new TV

411
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,700
                    a lot better
            than the old one.   

412
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,900
We're not talking TV here.      

413
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,400
    This is the latest          
      in video technology.      

414
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,600
     We've got Dolby sound,     
 black matrix, high resolution. 

415
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,200
     I mean, look at that.      

416
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's almost as if Deputy Dog's 
right in the room with us.      

417
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
        Yeah.                   
                         Yeah.  

418
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,000
            My God.             

419
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,500
It's another scorcher out there.

420
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
      I am sick and tired       

421
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,800
      of peeling patients       
    off of my leather couch.    

422
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,700
         I'll tell you,         
    the ones in shorts          

423
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,700
scream like banshees            
when I get them up fast.        

424
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,200
    Well, fortunately,          
I'm a trained psychiatrist      

425
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,900
  and I've learned to tune out  
        cries for help.         

426
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,100
      Say, where's Carla?       

427
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,800
    She asked us to lock her    
         in the office          

428
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,400
  until the heat wave breaks.   

429
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,100
      For goodness sakes.       

430
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
    I mean this has gone on     
          long enough.          

431
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,500
 The human female doesn't have  
    an estrous cycle.           

432
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
 Someone is gonna have to tell  
      her that the weather      

433
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,500
cannot affect human beings      
        this way.               

434
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,800
    Carla! May I have a word    
    with you, please?           

435
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,600
              Oh!               

436
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,300
    How is she, Fras?           

437
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,400
        Be afraid.              

438
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,200
        Be very afraid.         

439
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Has anyone seen                 
an afternoon paper?             

440
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
                Uh, what are you
                    looking for?

441
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,600
Well, because                   
Robin's statement               

442
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,400
         about me being his true
                love is supposed

443
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
to be in the late edition.      

444
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
I sent Woody out                
for it hours ago.               

445
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
 You, you sent Woody out there? 

446
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
    It's a hundred degrees.     

447
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,300
     I'm sorry, Miss Howe.      

448
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,500
 I would have been here sooner, 

449
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,400
but I think I passed out between
    the newsstand and here.     

450
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,800
Woody, man,                     
are you all right?              

451
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,600
            Yes, he's all right.

452
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,100
I bet I'm on the cover.         

453
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,800
                      Heat wave,
                    heat wave...

454
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
                      heat wave.

455
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,600
         children in sprinklers,
            heat wave...        

456
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,400
So it's a little warm out.      

457
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
                  Grandma?      

458
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,400
        Is that you, Grandma?   

459
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,100
             Thank you, Grandma.

460
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,300
                 Here it is.    

461
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,100
"Millionaire Robin Colcord says 

462
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,900
     that his true love         
is some Boston bar manager."    

463
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
         What?                  

464
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
        That's it?!             

465
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,100
  I thought I was gonna         
    be big news.                

466
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
     Such is the transitory     
        nature of fame.         

467
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,700
        You have missed         
    your moment in the sun.     

468
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,500
 I had three hours in the sun.  

469
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,300
Would somebody shut him up?     

470
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,600
        This just isn't fair.   

471
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
    Robin gave it up for me.    

472
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,100
     Me, not Jeanne Marie.      

473
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Well, hey,                      

474
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
             I wouldn't worry so
        much about Jeanne Marie.

475
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
                    She's washed
                        up, too.

476
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
         Look where they put her
        on <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>   

477
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,500
                  Center bottom.

478
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
                  Nobody's gonna
              call on her there.

479
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,200
             She might as well  
                be a Gabor.     

480
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,600
              MAN:              
I'll take Robin Colcord's       
        lover to block.         

481
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,900
             No, no, whoa, whoa!

482
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
                  Come on, guys,
             switch the channel.

483
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,300
  Put a game on or something.   

484
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm trying, Sammy.              

485
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
How do you work                 
this damned remote?             

486
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
         Oh, wait, you need this
        one to work that one.   

487
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,300
      Damn!                     
                Relax. Relax.   

488
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,300
No, it was my turn, Sam!        

489
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,000
Everybody in the world was      
    supposed to know that...    

490
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
    that I was Robin's          
         mystery femme.         

491
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,900
  I was supposed to be famous.  

492
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
            You know, that's not
        what you said before.   

493
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
         You said the only thing
                that mattered   

494
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
    was that Robin loves you.   

495
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,800
Yeah, yeah, well...             

496
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,700
that was back when              
I thought Jeanne Marie          

497
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,200
was gonna be laughed at.        

498
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
But now, I didn't know          
that she was gonna become       

499
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
America's little sweetheart     
and I was gonna become          

500
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,900
America's little                
stupid idiot nobody.            

501
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
         Honey, listen, from the
      outside, fame looks great.

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,100
        But when you actually   
              have it, it's not,

503
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,000
            it's not all that   
          it's cracked up to be.

504
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,300
    Oh, how would you know?     

505
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Well, I had a little bit        
of fame, once upon a time.      

506
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,300
  Oh, yeah, right, that time you
almost got hit by that truck.   

507
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,600
        No.                     

508
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
No, no, no, come on.            

509
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,500
When I was pitching             
for the Sox.                    

510
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, sure,                     

511
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,400
      fame has its perks.       

512
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,800
I mean, you don't have to stand 
    in line at restaurants.     

513
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,900
    That's very nice.           

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,300
And cops let you slide          
on a few traffic tickets.       

515
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,400
  That's... that's very nice.   

516
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,700
Autographs, I mean, that's cool 
        and all of that.        

517
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,100
        But, basically,         
      it's just a hassle.       

518
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
            Really?             

519
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,100
          Yeah, sure.           

520
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
        Not being famous        
      is ten times better.      

521
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,600
            Really?             
Yeah.                           

522
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,600
Yeah, you get treated           
just like everybody else.       

523
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
You can go to the               
supermarket in peace.           

524
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Nobody crowds around you.       

525
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,800
As a matter of fact,            

526
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,300
they don't pay any              
attention to you at all.        

527
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
No, they certainly don't        
let you cut ahead of them       

528
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
in the ten-items-or-less line.  

529
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
    No, no, no, no, no, no.     

530
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
    You have to wait behind     
      all the old ladies.       

531
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,500
    Some of them have           
     way beyond ten items.      

532
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,200
'Cause believe me, you've got   
all the time in the world       

533
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,000
to count every little can,      
  every little loaf of bread.   

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
             Sam...             

535
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
By the time you get to the front
          of the line,          

536
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,000
     they're only too happy     
  to cut up your credit cards   

537
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,800
  right in front of your face   
    because you're nothing!     

538
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
                          Sam...

539
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,600
         Sam, are you all right?

540
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,900
I miss it so much, Rebecca.     

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
        Oh...                   

542
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,700
                  I know you do.

543
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,900
        But we're both better   
            off without it, Sam.

544
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
Do you remember, remember       
all the attention I got         

545
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,100
when that truck almost hit me?  

546
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,700
     Well, there's no break     
    in this heat wave.          

547
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,900
 As a matter of fact, tomorrow  
  is going to be even hotter.   

548
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,400
         Let's look now         
      at the satellite...       

549
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,600
        (rumbling)              

550
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,400
          Oh, my God!           

551
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
     Clear out, everybody!      

552
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,900
    She's gonna blow!           

553
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,700
        (rumbling)              

554
