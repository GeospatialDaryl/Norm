00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,589
Not again.

Every day this week!

00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:11,392
If I find out who
this N.R.P. creep is,

5
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:12,994
I'm really gonna
let him have it.

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:13,979
Hurry up, Norm.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,680
Sammy's getting
a lot faster at this.

8
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,181
Got it.

9
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,201
Hey, Norm.

10
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,270
Listen, I uh...

11
00:00:22,337 --> 00:00:24,706
I know the N.P.
Stands for Norm Peterson.

12
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,034
What's the "R" stand for?

13
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,341
Resourceful.

CLIFF:
Well, I'll be darned.

23
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,045
Yeah, what's that?

24
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:21,780
Well, it says here if you walk

25
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:24,449
with a quarter wedged
between your knees

26
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:28,053
your, your posture
will be a lot better.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,255
Hey, give me a couple of bits
here, Norm, I want to try it.

28
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,293
Tell you what, Cliff...

29
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,462
here's a buck
to not try it, okay?

30
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:41,132
Fair enough.

31
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,401
(groans)

32
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,036
What's the matter?

33
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,706
It's from Lilith.

34
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,944
Oh, that's awful.

35
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:55,730
What? What's awful?

36
00:01:55,797 --> 00:02:01,552
"Dear Frasier, life in
the Eco-pod is wonderful.

37
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,404
"Googie and I are happier

00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,991

Made in heaven?

42
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,770
"Our marriage
is over."

43
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,473
That burns my hide- Lilith
sending that Mail-gram.

44
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,225
Well, thank you, Cliff.

45
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:27,545
Well, all of a sudden
a first class stamp isn't any good anymore?

46
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,798
I mean, people,

47
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,166
I've been telling you,
I mean, our success rate

48
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,301
is almost 50%!

49
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:36,538
Well, you know,
unless it's raining,

50
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,573
'cause then the tires...

51
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,591
I'm sorry to hear that.

52
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,960
Sorry.

53
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,428
Oh, thank you, Sam.

54
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,365
Divorce, Lilith
wants a divorce.

55
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:50,368
You know, I, I know
we've been separated

56
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,603
and I've been saying
some pretty bitter things,

57
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:55,573
but... I guess deep down
in my heart of hearts,

58
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,543
I'd always hoped for some
sort of a reconciliation.

59
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:02,130
Now I just don't
know how to feel.

60
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:03,497
Hey, you know, Fras,

61
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:05,633
I went through this same
thing when Nick left me.

62
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:09,037
And the way I look at it,
here's what you can do.

63
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:12,706
You can get angry and bitter,
learn to hate the world,

64
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:14,475
snap at people.

65
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:15,643
Or?

66
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,711
Or what?

67
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:25,487
You want to talk about it, make
yourself feel a little better?

68
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:27,964
Oh, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Sam,

69
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,092
but, uh, I think I'd just, uh,

70
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,960
rather be alone right now.

71
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,050
Try to figure out how
I'm gonna carry on now that,

72
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:43,021
I know that Lilith
is never coming back.

73
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:49,794
Boy, oh boy.

74
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,529
That must be rough, huh?

75
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,031
I've never been married,

76
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,368
but, uh, I remember
how depressed I was when Ma left me.

77
00:03:57,369 --> 00:04:01,589
You referring to the time your
mother moved to Florida

78
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,491
when you were 37 years old?

79
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,643
It still hurt.

80
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,080
Poor Fras.

81
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,916
Boy, I'm never seen him so sad.

82
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,183
And it's too bad.

83
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,569
You know, he's always
there for us.

84
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,636
He's always helping us out.

85
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:17,471
What can we do to cheer him up?

86
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,589
I don't know.

87
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,957
Oh, I've got it.

88
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,659
Oh! We'll throw
him a party.

89
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:22,777
What?

90
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,962
A divorce party.

91
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,064
You know, then that way he'll
know that all his friends

92
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,317
support him and, and maybe it'll
brighten his day a little bit.

93
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,836
We'll, we'll have it
for him tomorrow when he usually comes in.

94
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,772
I don't know, you know,
a party for a guy

95
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,273
whose wife just left him...

96
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,175
uh... it seems
kind of strange.

97
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:39,611
Makes perfect sense to me.

98
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,251
Look out, everybody,
here he comes.

99
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:48,953
Okay, what do we yell
when he comes in?

100
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,538
Just yell, "Surprise!"

101
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:54,959
Surprise, surprise, surprise...

102
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,227
okay, I think I've got it.

103
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,413
ALL:
Surprise!

104
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:02,099
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

105
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,968
♪ For he's
a jolly good fellow ♪

106
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:07,255
♪ For he's a jolly good
fellow... ♪

107
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,674
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

108
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:12,677
(cheering)

109
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,512
Is this for me?

110
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,280
Yes, I thought it would help
you get over Lilith.

111
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,349
Do you like it?
Oh, very much. Thank you.

112
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,584
Well, it was my idea.

113
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,686
The guys fought me
at every turn.

114
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:24,189
Okay, everybody,
let's lift our glasses here

115
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,890
and toast Frasier's
new-found freedom!

116
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,024
Yeah!
Yeah!

117
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,460
Woody, you having a beer?

118
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,529
Why not?

119
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,397
I'm a grown man, I'm an adult.

120
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,133
I can handle my alcohol.

121
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,891
Plus we're out
of chocolate milk.

122
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,254
(glass clinking)

123
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,141
I want to make the
first toast to Frasier.

124
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,043
Lilith stinks!

125
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,611
ALL:
Lilith stinks!

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,014
Profoundly put.

127
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,032
But I really don't want
this to degenerate

128
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:56,437
into a "bash Lilith" party, so,
look, what's done is done.

129
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:58,339
It's about time I got over it.

130
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,908
Oh, well, then you're
not going to like

131
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,242
what we did to the dart board.

132
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,577
Dah!

133
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:06,948
Well, maybe just one throw.

134
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,321
(cheering)

135
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,157
Nice shot!
All right, Frasier!

136
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:17,959
Well, I've got one at home.

137
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,551
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

138
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,368
Woody, uh, exactly
how many beers

139
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,137
have you had there,
young fellow?

140
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:34,542
Just one... Mom.

141
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,979
Wood, you got to be
careful there, buddy.

142
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,482
You never know how liquor's
going to affect you, you know?

143
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,183
Sometimes you
can get depressed.

144
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,985
Sometimes you get giddy.

145
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:47,254
So, Norm, when're you gonna get
off your butt and get a job?

146
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:50,291
Sometimes you just
get brutally honest.

147
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:53,077
Frasier, you know
how I feel about you.

148
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,511
But I'm not
any good with words,

149
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:57,181
so I'm gonna let this
do the talking for me.

150
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,749
(tawdry trumpet riff)

151
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,022
(strip tease music playing)

152
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,024
(patrons hooting and hollering)

153
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,595
Oh, Lordy, look at that!

154
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,315
Yeah!
Cake!

155
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,737
All right, huh? The world
of the exotic dancer.

156
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,739
A little sleazy if you ask me.

157
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,143
Almost as sleazy as the types
who frequent those joints.

158
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,878
Oh, hey! It's Cliff!

159
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,652
Hey, uh, I must
look like a Cliff.

160
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:40,024
Uh, excuse me, miss,
could you move the veil,

161
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,493
you're blocking
the mocha creme, here.

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,861
You're kidding, right?

163
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:46,046
No, you see, uh, sweetheart,

164
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,715
over the years
our priorities change.

165
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:49,550
Yeah? How so?

166
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:54,856
Hey there, Miss Krapence.

167
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,657
That's Mr. Krapence.

168
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:59,143
That's not what I heard.

169
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:02,647
Say, Woody, why
don't you sit down

170
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,381
right here for a
while, all right?

171
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,051
What's with this
"Miss Krapence" stuff?

172
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,869
I mean, who's been
making cracks?

173
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,023
I've got an ex-wife,
you know.

174
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,392
Whoa, what-what-what
are you doin' man?

175
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,050
Why, why, why are you taking
shots at, at Paul, huh?

176
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,229
Well, come on, Sam,

177
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,947
use your head.

178
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:22,049
The guy's in his 40s,
he's not married.

179
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,885
He's always braggin'
about his sex life

180
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:25,086
and yet he's always here.

181
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,255
It all adds up, Sam.

182
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:30,792
Or should I say, Samantha?

183
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,485
Would you guys do
something with him?

184
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,894
Look at that, Norm.
He's fast asleep.

185
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,729
Hmm?

186
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,463
Oop!

187
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,500
Oop! Look at this legs-
they're twitching.

188
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,987
I bet you he's dreaming
he's chasing rabbits.

189
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,040
Don't be ridiculous, Cliff.

190
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,275
Only dogs dream about
chasing rabbits.

191
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,126
(barking)

192
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,520
Frasier, are you
enjoying your party?

193
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,615
Yes, I am, very much.

194
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,518
Uh, friends,

195
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,487
uh, I just wanted
to say thanks.

196
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:17,821
Really, thank you very much.

197
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,757
Aw.
Okay.

198
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,593
It's just terrific you
guys tried to cheer me up

199
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,197
and, uh, I just think it's time
I was shoving off now, okay?

200
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,182
Frasier, you're going home?

201
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,768
Well, yes, and, uh,
thank you again, Rebecca,

202
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,004
for putting all this together.

203
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,690
Frasier, are you going
to be all right?

204
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:40,427
I, I just get a little emotional
when I, when I drink too much.

205
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:43,330
(laughing):
Look at me.

206
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:44,281
Fras, you know what?

207
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:45,616
I think I'm gonna
drive you home.

208
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,918
Oh, I would really
appreciate that, Rebecca.

209
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,555
I sent Frederick
to his grandmother's,

210
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:53,291
and I just don't want to go
home to that house alone.

211
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,759
Frasier for what it's worth,

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,328
I think that Lilith
made a big mistake. Well, thank you.

213
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,528
And for what it's worth,

214
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,564
I think that Evan Drake
made a big mistake, too.

215
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,766
Thank you, Frasier.

216
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,334
And, well, uh,
while we're at it,

217
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,670
so did Sam, and, uh,
Martin Teal,

218
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,538
and Robin Colcord and that...

219
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:11,041
that cousin of Woody's
that used to play the piano,

220
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,344
and Mark Newberger.

221
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,279
And those are just
the ones you know about.

222
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,781
Ah.

223
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,440
I hope you didn't mind my
pouring my guts out to you.

224
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,542
I didn't mind a bit.
I was glad to help.

225
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,061
So I'll see you
tomorrow at work?

226
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,714
Uh, Rebecca, why don't
you come on in for a bit?

227
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:34,615
I'll make some coffee.

228
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:36,417
Sure. Okay.
Great.

229
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:37,624
All I've got's instant.

230
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,102
Oh, instant's fine.

231
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,904
You know, come
to think of it, Fras,

232
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:42,440
you have a really hard job.

233
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,343
You listen to other people tell
you their problems all day long

234
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,178
and you never really have a
chance to talk about yourself.

235
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,747
You're a very sympathetic
person, Rebecca.

236
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:50,948
Thanks again.

237
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,283
Frasier, would you
quit thanking me?

238
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,352
That's what friends do,
they help each other.

239
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,070
You really are
my friend, aren't you?

240
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:59,039
Well, of course I am.

241
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,821
Fras, I think I better go.

242
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,656
Oh, oh, God.

243
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:18,158
Rebecca,
I'm-I'm so sorry.

244
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:23,831
Uh, this... this is
entirely unintentional.

245
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,033
I-It wasn't premeditated
or anything.

246
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,735
I, uh, oh, God, uh...

247
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,603
Frasier, I understand what
you're trying to say.

248
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,204
Let's just forget
it ever happened, okay?

249
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:32,406
Rebecca, wait, wait.

250
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,374
I've always found you,
you know, rather attractive.

251
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,875
Well, very attractive really.

252
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:37,779
Well, thank you very much.
That's sweet of you to say,

253
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,313
but I really think
I'd better be go...

254
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,799
It's just that seeing you
now in my home,

255
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,534
looking into
your beautiful eyes,

256
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,153
I just wanted to,

257
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:48,005
I had to...

258
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,494
Oh, God, what am I doing?!

259
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:58,799
This is not romantic,
this is just weird!

260
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,335
Frasier, y-you're my friend!

261
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:03,137
I've known you for years!

262
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,106
First Sam, now you.
Who's next- Cliff?

263
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,007
Oh, God!

264
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:10,110
Oh, Rebecca, you, you have
to admit,

265
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:13,346
there's always been some
sexual tension between us.

266
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:15,099
There has?

267
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,935
Yes. It started the first day
you came into the bar.

268
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,838
I heard your sexy, smoky voice.

269
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,573
I, I looked up and I thought,

270
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,091
"My God!
Who is that woman?"

271
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:25,108
Really?!

272
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:28,245
Really.

273
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,047
Your turn.

274
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:31,882
What did you think
when you saw me?

275
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,220
I thought...

276
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:41,726
Well, you know, Fras, I met
so many people that day.

277
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,312
Well, I mean, through the years

278
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,182
you must have at least found me
a, a little attractive.

279
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,569
Well, I, uh...

280
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,071
Oh, come on!

281
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:57,758
I mean, surely
for as long as we've known each other,

282
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,026
there has to be some
sexual tension!

283
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,261
Why?!

284
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:02,362
Well it's been proven
in scientific journals!

285
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,598
People who spend any amount
of time with each other

286
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:07,101
do experience some sort of
subconscious sexual attraction!

287
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:08,235
Are you sure?

288
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:10,054
Do you want me
to get the book?!

289
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,255
No, no, no, Frasier,
Frasier, Frasier,

290
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,422
Frasier, forget the book!

291
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:15,592
Frasier,
listen to me. I...

292
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,745
You are a very attractive man.

293
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:22,483
And you're funny, you're witty,
and you're very charming.

294
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,385
And one time,

295
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,338
you came in the bar
and you had on these pants,

296
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,774
and they made your buns
look really cute.

297
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:31,992
What colour were they?

298
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,594
I could go put them on.

299
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:36,413
No, Fras...

300
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,883
Fras, you don't need to put
those pants on.

301
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,687
My, my point here is that, for
all the years I've known you,

302
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,755
you have been married.

303
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,424
So, uh, I just, I never
really took notice.

304
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,944
Well, I'm not married now.

305
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:52,713
No, you're not.

306
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,154
Yeah, he's still out cold,
Normie.

307
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,640
Mm.
Think we ought to wake him?

308
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,474
Well, we could.

309
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,243
You know, we could take him
over to his house

310
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:08,414
and, uh, get him undressed,
put him in bed,

311
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,447
let him sleep it off
in peace and quiet.

312
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,683
Yeah, we could do that.

313
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:19,457
But we're not going to, are we?

314
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,192
No, sir, my good friend,
we are not.

315
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,878
What we are going
to do, though,

316
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,413
is, uh, get a pan
of warm water,

317
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,715
put his hand in it,

318
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,351
and, uh, step back
and watch the hilarity ensue.

319
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,948
Guys, am I the only one here
who's concerned about Frasier?

320
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:39,643
I think so.

321
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:40,911
You know, this could be

322
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:43,848
a depressing night for him,
you know?

323
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,382
We're his friends,
and here we are

324
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,250
just playing stupid camp games
with Woody.

325
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,585
Wait a minute.

326
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:53,057
The hand in the pan of warm
water a stupid camp game?

327
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,926
I don't even know who you are,
Sam Malone.

328
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:58,028
I'm serious.

329
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,763
Remember the last time
he got this upset?

330
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,565
He ended up on a ledge.

331
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,667
Yeah, you're right about that.

332
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,052
All I'm saying is maybe he
shouldn't be alone.

333
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,420
Yeah, yeah, maybe

334
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,772
we ought to go over there with
some chips and a pizza.

335
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,207
Thank you.

336
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:13,410
Yeah. I'll get some videos
or something, right?

337
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,746
Well, yeah, it feels good
to do something nice

338
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,147
for somebody sometimes, yeah?

339
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,482
Yeah.
This is Cheers, right?

340
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:19,863
We, we stick with each other.

341
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:21,952
NORM:
That's right. We take care of our own.

342
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,587
Hey, guys,
you'd better take an umbrella.

343
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,668
It's starting to mist.

344
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:27,975
Mist?

345
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:29,409
Oh, man, that, uh,

346
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:33,130
that really messes up my hair.

347
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:34,465
It's not gonna help the tickle

348
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,999
in the back
of my throat either.

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,685
And this, uh, sweater
is sure to pill.

350
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:41,455
Well, now what are we gonna do?

351
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,993
I'll get the pan.
You heat up the water.

352
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:02,043
Now, Rebecca, you're,
you're sure you're okay with this?

353
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,811
Because I wouldn't want
to do anything

354
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:05,813
to compromise our friendship,

355
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,549
and I know you're in a very
delicate state right now.

356
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,051
You ready to hit the sack?

357
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:11,802
Right upstairs.

358
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,123
You get some champagne

359
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:17,791
and I'll go upstairs
and get ready.

360
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,159
Right. Okay.

361
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,195
Take your time.

362
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,030
This is not a drill.

363
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,486
This is not a drill!

364
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:34,407
(humming)

365
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,046
(doorbell rings)

366
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:40,497
Damn!

367
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,686
Hey!
There you are!

368
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,144
(laughs) I didn't want you

369
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:50,891
to be alone and depressed
on a night like this.

370
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,260
So what I did was
I brought over

371
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,962
some Three Stooges
tapes we can watch.

372
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,564
Whoo! Gloomy in here.
There you go!

373
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,132
Listen, Sam, uh...

374
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,734
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

375
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,988
My hair's all frizzy.
But what the heck?

376
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,988
You're worth it, buddy.

377
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,290
Sam...

378
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,391
You know, I was thinking
about not coming here.

379
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:10,644
Then I thought about how,
you know,

380
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,880
how you'd feel to see
a friendly face around,

381
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:13,881
so here I am.

382
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:14,882
(both chuckle)

383
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:17,117
Sam, uh...
Yeah?

384
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:21,121
I, I appreciate all
this, but, you know,

385
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:23,490
that you're here in
my hour of need and all,

386
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:24,958
and I just want to tell you

387
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,493
I think I'm okay with it now.

388
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,995
I think I'm just
gonna head upstairs

389
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:30,564
and you know... (yawns)

390
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,132
put my head down, you know?

391
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,667
I, I...

392
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:34,735
Hi, Fras.

393
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,002
Carla!
Hey!

394
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, Fras, sorry about your wife,
blah, blah, blah.

395
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,808
Well, brought some pizza.

396
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm just gonna dig right in.

397
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,228
Give me a piece, there,
will you?

398
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:48,916
Uh, Sam, this is such
a wonderful gesture.

399
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,584
It shows a sensitivity that I...

400
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,486
(Sam and Carla laugh)

401
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:56,857
Geez, doesn't that
hurt Curly's nose?

402
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,525
Well, of course it does.

403
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,694
That's what makes it funny.

404
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:01,962
(laughs)

405
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,766
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

406
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:06,834
Woo-oo-oo-oo!
Woo-oo-oo-oo!

407
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,769
You got anything
to wash this down with?

408
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,070
Yeah. How about
some napkins?

409
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:12,006
Um, sure.
I'll, I'll get some.

410
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,140
They're, they're upstairs.

411
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,675
That's where we keep them.

412
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:19,546
I'll be, I'll be back in, oh,
15 minutes or so.

413
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:21,515
(doorbell rings)

414
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,834
Are you guys expecting anyone?

415
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,652
Uh, yeah, Norm and Cliff.

416
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,459
Aha! Tell him what
he's won, Bob!

417
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:35,128
Whoa! Pizza!

418
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:36,196
Beer.

419
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:38,098
Norm, Norm brought beer! Well.

420
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,867
No, no, no, I need a beer.
I'm a little thirsty.

421
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,505
Sure.
I'll, uh, I'll get you one.

422
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,054
It's, uh, it's upstairs.

423
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,622
You keep your beer upstairs?

424
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:46,857
Uh, yeah, in the bedroom.

425
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:47,941
You, too?

426
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,962
(doorbell rings)

427
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:56,333
Paul! (chuckles)

428
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,970
Are you, uh, alone or did you
bring some friends, Paul?

429
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,309
What's that supposed to mean?

430
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,677
Well...

431
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:10,080
Nothing.

432
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,148
Come on in.

433
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,349
Thanks for cheering me up.

434
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,017
I didn't come here
to cheer you up.

435
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,752
I, I came to say something.

436
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,139
Everybody, there's, there's
something I've got to say.

437
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,741
Uh, Woody made some comments
earlier,

438
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,577
and at first I was angry,
but then I got to thinking.

439
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,275
I took a long hard
look at myself.

440
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,782
I'm 45 years old, my mother's
dead, what am I waiting for?

441
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,951
I, I guess what I'm trying
to say is "World..."

442
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,454
Hey, Paul,

443
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,623
this is Frasier's night.
Do you mind?

444
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,863
You're right, Sammy.
I'm sorry.

445
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,453
Is there any pizza left?

446
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:52,139
I don't think so, Paul.

447
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,978
Just, uh, make yourself
at home, Paul.

448
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,514
Say, my God, is it
still raining outside?

449
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:02,583
You know, I'm, I'm gonna
go upstairs

450
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,817
and close those windows.

451
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,386
Okay? I'll probably be
a little while.

452
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,120
Oh, no, no!
Hold on!

453
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:08,822
Whoa, no, you don't, buddy.

454
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:11,357
You're not gonna go up there and
brood and be all alone by yourself.

455
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:12,759
No way. No way.

456
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,295
We're here to make sure
that you enjoy yourself.

457
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:18,832
Well, then let me
go upstairs and close the windows!

458
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,267
I beg of you!

459
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,402
It's been a long time
since I've closed the windows!

460
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,937
They're wide open!

461
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,957
Don't you be silly, you big lug.

462
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,292
Hey, look what we did here.

463
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,660
We made a little space
for you on the sofa.

464
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,579
Yeah, you can be the meat

465
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,982
in our best friend sandwich.

466
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:40,904
Hey, Fras, we got six hours
of The Stooges for you, man.

467
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,657
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

468
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,075
Oh, God, look at that, fellows.

469
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,777
You big lug,
you got a tear in your eye.

470
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,401
FRASIER:
Okay, guys...

471
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:56,603
SAM:
Take care, buddy.

472
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,404
Thanks again.
Good night.

473
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:59,472
CLIFF:
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

474
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:00,907
Yes, yes,
nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

475
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:02,575
SAM:
We'll watch these again some other time.

476
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,026
Okay, bye-bye.
(door shuts)

477
00:21:04,078 --> 00:21:05,578
(quick footsteps on stairs)

478
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,529
Oh, Frasier, I'm sorry.

479
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:24,230
I must have fallen asleep.

480
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:25,348
What time is it?

481
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,167
Well, it's pretty late.

482
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:31,371
Uh, I guess I'll go
downstairs and, uh, sleep on the couch.

483
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:32,518
Maybe I should just go.

484
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:35,909
No, no, you don't
have to go home.

485
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,311
You don't have
to sleep on the couch.

486
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:42,348
Just a second.

487
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:51,125
(door opens, shuts)

488
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:52,392
Frasier, what was that?

489
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:53,494
What was what?

490
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,130
I thought I heard a door slam.

491
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,399
You don't think those guys
are back, do you?

492
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,466
No, no impossible.

493
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,734
I locked and dead bolted it.

494
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,303
They'd need a key to get in.

495
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:05,672
Now where were we?

496
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,998
Let's make this a night
we'll never forget.

497
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,534
(door opens)

498
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:24,775
Frasier?

499
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,060
Lilith!

500
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,798
Rebecca?!

501
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,451
Lilith.

502
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,241
Am I the only one
who feels awkward here?
