1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,749
Alright, locking it up.
Who needs a ride home?

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,873
Come on, who needs a ride home?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,992
l guess we're all sober enough
to drive ourselves tonight.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,873
Looks like you get to go
straight home for a change.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,197
l've never driven straight home.
l wouldn't know how to do it.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,711
- OK, Coach. You can take me.
- What a prince.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,354
- Thanks, l owe you one.
- Any time.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,152
Goodnight now.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,713
Drop me off at Kenmore Square.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,638
l can catch a cab
to take me back here to my car.

11
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,676
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,677
Just having a little late-night fun.

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,633
Listen, pencil neck,
you're starting to get on my nerves.

14
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,910
Please don't call me pencil neck.
l am not a pencil neck.

15
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,155
l'm sorry.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,158
l didn't mean to call you
pencil neck, gozzlehead.

17
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,668
Name calling.
The last refuge of the monosyllabic.

18
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,958
l don't know what that means
but l heard slob in there.

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,836
Hey, come on, Diane, Carla,
you go at each other every night.

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,838
We're getting scouts in here
from the roller derby.

21
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,157
Listen, l mean it. Do something
about this, or l'm gonna...

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,276
l'm gonna think
about personnel changes.

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,358
What choice do we have, Sam?
We don't like each other.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
No, Carla, Sam's... Carla.

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,432
Sam's making good sense.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,117
You could knock me over
with a feather, but he is.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,471
We need to sit down together
and talk this out.

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,750
That's nuts.
What's there to talk about?

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,190
Listen. l want you to sit down
and settle this, or else.

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,959
We'll do it.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,956
Carla

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,475
Do it.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,714
- Can we use this table?
- Oh, you mean here? No.

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,391
l was thinking more along the lines
of your homes or a coffee shop.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,877
Down by the docks, maybe.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,189
Sam. We'll lock up, don't worry about
it.

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,709
Now is the time. This is the place.

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,274
Unchecked rage
is like a festering wound.

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,472
Laughs aplenty tonight.

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,074
Look. You expect me to l leave the
two of you here without a referee?

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,191
Come on. What could happen?

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,594
Nothing.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,790
Two women left alone,
who hate each other,

44
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,718
in a room filled
with glass and alcohol. Silly.

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,352
- This was your idea. Bye.
- Alright. Check the locks twice, OK?

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,799
Aye, aye, captain.

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,832
And make sure the lights over the bar
are out.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,554
Lights over the bar. Right.
Goodnight.

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,478
Maybe check the thermostat.

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,912
We'll do that, yes.
Thank you, goodnight and goodbye.

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,232
l have no life insurance.
Just this place.

52
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,553
Goodnight.

53
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,108
OK, let's sit down, relax and open
the lines of communication.

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,518
l want a drink.

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,200
Wonderful.
Let's have a bottle of wine.

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,993
l think we've got your favourite.
ChÃ¢teau Guam.

57
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,516
l'm talking a drink. l'll make it.

58
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,631
Wonderful. OK.

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,910
You're gonna like this.

60
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,594
And then we use...

61
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,395
l only do it for special occasions.

62
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,193
Well, Carla, thank you. l'm honoured.

63
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,357
You're really getting
into the spirit of this thing.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,357
- What's the drink?
- A family recipe.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,153
We call it Leap lnto An Open Grave.

66
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,391
You're kidding.

67
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,638
My Uncle Joe stumbled across it
when he was making a car bomb.

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,711
You're kidding, right? Carla?

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,871
One for good luck.

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,870
Nice touch.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,198
Keep the glasses moving so the fumes
don't burn a hole in the ceiling.

72
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,518
Delicious.

73
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,711
And it goes right to your head.

74
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,593
No one in my family lives past 43.

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,198
OK, let's chat.

76
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,470
l don't know what we're talking for.

77
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,478
We're different people.
We'll never get along.

78
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,879
- We're not totally different.
- Name one similarity.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,118
Well, we...

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,035
We're both women.

81
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,832
Why do l get the feeling
that we're jerking our chain, here?

82
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,315
No, there's more.
We both share the same job.

83
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,117
Of course,
l'm not as good at it as you are.

84
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,595
lt doesn't take a genius to notice.

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,839
But thank you.

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,474
You know, Carla, l particularly
admire the way you handle passes.

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,872
A guy in the back room tonight
asked me

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,630
if l wanted to play something called
The Shepherdess And The Hun.

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,429
Which part did he want you to play?

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,313
This is fun, isn't it?

92
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,437
Easy give-and-take
between two working gals.

93
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,597
You know,
l think we're coming together.

94
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,472
That's the Open Grave.

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,149
Give it another 1 5 minutes, you'll be
French-kissing the sump pump.

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,189
No, seriously. We're connecting,
l'm certain of it.

97
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,108
Yeah. People need people.

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,231
l'm a people person. l can be there
for you, l wanna be there for you.

99
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,238
Please, benefit from my depth.

100
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,908
This stuff. Great.

101
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,718
You would do that for me?
You'd listen to me?

102
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,275
With all my heart, mind and soul.

103
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,832
You know,... Thank you.

104
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,872
There are moments when l wanna spill
my guts, know what l mean?

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,194
Yes.

106
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,794
l've got things,

107
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,876
one thing in particular,

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,788
that l've been carrying around
inside of me for a long time.

109
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,559
Tell me.

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,912
l barely know you.

111
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,870
Well, Carla, you brought it up.
You obviously want to get it out.

112
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,675
Maybe l do, but...

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,037
Carla, l swear,
l'll keep my mouth shut. l swear.

114
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,190
About five years ago...

115
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,549
..Sam threw a party here.

116
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,272
The big guy was still on the sauce

117
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,597
so every night
was an excuse for a big bash.

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,158
Anyway, this one time
he was too tanked to drive home.

119
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,518
So l took him.

120
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,759
l helped him upstairs....

121
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,438
..to his bedroom.

122
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,112
One thing led to another.

123
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,714
Nine months later, Gino was born.

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,633
- Gino?
- Sam's son.

125
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,917
Carla, l don't believe this.

126
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,429
Me neither, you're gonna die.

127
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,991
Sam.

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,232
Sam did this?

129
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,072
He's a beast.

130
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,396
No. Sam's been really good about it.

131
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,956
l mean,
he's always helped out with the kid.

132
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,196
l've never blamed him for anything.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,911
lt's as much my fault as his.

134
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,759
But you bore the child,
you're raising the child.

135
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,348
You plucky little soldier, you.

136
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,755
Sam and l are the only ones
that know, understand?

137
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,154
Carla, l...
l just wanna hug you right now.

138
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,270
l feel kinda close to you, too.

139
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,792
<i>People</i>

140
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,632
<i>People who need people</i>

141
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,919
Good God.

142
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,350
Carla, my gumba.

143
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,438
l like somebody who knows
when she's had enough.

144
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,631
Hi. Sorry l'm back,
l forgot my bubblegum.

145
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,879
l know that sounds crazy...

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,877
Oh, my God, Carla, you killed her.

147
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,514
Don't get your hopes up, Sam.
l just mixed her a drink.

148
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,871
Carla, you made her an Open Grave.

149
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,594
Yeah. And she leaped right in.

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,109
She's out cold.
This is irresponsible.

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,389
- l tried to slow her down.
- l'm gonna take her home.

152
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,398
- Will you get her things for me?
- Sure.

153
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,591
Did you straighten things out?

154
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,870
Yeah. You know, it was great.

155
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,319
She got sickening,

156
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,149
l told the biggest lie l could
think of and she started to sing.

157
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,949
- Why did you do that?
- She brings out the devil in me.

158
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,677
l dunno. l was
getting a buzz on feeling loose.

159
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,711
l decided to have some fun with her.

160
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,432
What did you tell her?

161
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,835
Sam, it's something l told Diane.

162
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,111
She swore she would never tell
another living soul.

163
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,037
She'll tell you tomorrow.

164
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,913
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm.

165
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,589
- How's it going?
- Daddy's rich, Mamma's good-lookin'!

166
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,395
Good evening.

167
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,479
Hi, Diane. How are you?

168
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,951
Hey, Sis,
how's my buddy feeling today?

169
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,069
Well,...

170
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,789
..l got up this morning,
washed my face.

171
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,196
l shaved my tongue.

172
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,519
l came right in.

173
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,196
However,

174
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,833
no regrets.

175
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,633
Evenings like that
come seldom in a lifetime.

176
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,430
- How are you, Carla?
- Fine, thanks.

177
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,636
How is poor little Gino?

178
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,032
A little hung over, are we?

179
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,993
l can't keep anything from you.

180
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,475
You know,
l know something to stop hangovers.

181
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,952
Thank God. What is it?

182
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,752
Don't drink so much.

183
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,438
Thank you.

184
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,229
But thank you, Sam. Truly.

185
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,038
For getting Carla and l together
at last.

186
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,718
You're welcome.

187
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,593
She really is a wonderful woman,
isn't she?

188
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,029
Yeah. She's alright.

189
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,550
And her children
are truly wonderful, too.

190
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,638
Yeah,
if you like chainsaws with feet.

191
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,275
But l understand that Gino is
an extraordinarily fine young man.

192
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,039
Which one's he?

193
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,349
He's... who he is.

194
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,673
- Sam, where's my bourbon and ginger?
- Coming right up.

195
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,950
You're slipping, sweetheart.

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,116
- You're staring at me.
- Oh, was l?

197
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,912
Right through me, in fact.

198
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,235
l've got to get home
to the little lady.

199
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,909
- lt's my tenth wedding anniversary.
- Congratulations.

200
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,349
- Big plans, huh?
- The biggest.

201
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,110
We're going out for a pizza. lt gets
me back here about ten o'clock.

202
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,194
A whole quarter.
l'm gonna name the Ferrari after you.

203
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,959
- Now look here, miss...
- No, you look...

204
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,119
- My office now.
- lt's a whole dollar below insult.

205
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,390
- Carla, right now.
- Sam.

206
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,876
lt wasn't her fault.
She was deliberately snubbed.

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,638
Diane, she's my employee.

208
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,354
This is none of your business.
Stay out of it.

209
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,916
Coach,
Sam just called Carla ''an employee''.

210
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,112
No kidding. How did Carla take it?

211
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,072
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Nothing. Bawl her out a little.

212
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,159
How dare he chastise her?
She can barely scrape out a living.

213
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,510
How much suffering
does she have to do?

214
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,189
She's raising four children, not
to mention one of them is Sam's...

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,470
One of Carla's kids is Sam's kid?

216
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,797
- No. l didn't say that.
- Let me figure this out, now.

217
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,316
Sam knows Carla five years, right?

218
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,398
Carla's youngest kid, Gino,
is seven and a half.

219
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,590
That's it. lt works out.

220
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,395
Wait a minute.

221
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,758
- Gino is seven and a half years old?
- Yeah.

222
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,031
And Sam and Carla have
only known each other five years?

223
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,630
Right, but who would ever figure
that Gino was Sam's kid?

224
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,555
She lied.

225
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,511
She deliberately lied.

226
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,909
You mean that Gino's not Sam's kid?

227
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,995
No.

228
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,829
Holy mackerel! This is gonna break
Sam's heart when he hears this.

229
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,271
l reached out to her.

230
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,719
That weasel.

231
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,350
Coach,

232
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,473
what do you do when you are so
furious you have to do something?

233
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,196
Well, l know you'll think it's crazy,
but l bang my head on the bar.

234
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,393
Doesn't sound crazy to me.
lt might do me good right now.

235
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,033
Well, OK.

236
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,520
- No, don't. Stop that, please.
- You feel better?

237
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,156
Yes. Thank you.

238
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,918
- How about you?
- l feel fine.

239
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,235
To me, it's kind of a picker-upper.

240
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,870
Hello. My name is Carla.
l'll be your slave for the evening.

241
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,959
No, l won't do it.
l won't give her the satisfaction.

242
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,993
She's just waiting for me
to break her confidence.

243
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,157
She can play me for the fool,
but she will not tarnish my dignity.

244
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,998
This is none of your concern.

245
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,159
Hello, my friend,
my dearest confidante.

246
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,475
How's your rotten,
lying little mouth?

247
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,836
Got you.

248
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,714
''One thing led to another,
and then Gino was born.''

249
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,637
l knew it. l knew you'd tell.

250
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,194
You had to tell somebody
our secret to find out.

251
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,151
- That's beside the point.
- lt isn't.

252
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,829
l knew you couldn't keep it. You hold
your secrets like your booze.

253
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,797
Telling me that story
was reprehensible.

254
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,196
Lighten up.
You wanna be my friend?

255
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,629
You wanna get along?
Let your hair down.

256
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,797
How about l take your hair
and scour the sink with it?

257
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,075
ls that a Brillo shot?

258
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,038
Only if it offends you.

259
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,469
You sound like a lady
who is getting tired of her teeth.

260
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,269
l'm tired of your teeth
and all the vermicelli in between.

261
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,198
ln my office.

262
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,272
Be quiet!

263
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,868
l think Sammy can handle that one,
huh, Coach?

264
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,238
l hate to see that kind of thing
between women.

265
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,956
l know what you mean, Coach.
Women fighting is very unladylike.

266
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,470
Unless, of course,
they're wallowing around in mudpits.

267
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,675
Now, somebody,
please, tell me what's going on.

268
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,959
Last night,
out of the goodness of my heart,

269
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,958
l reached out to this little twerp.

270
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,432
And she deliberately duped me
into believing

271
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,711
that you were
the father of one of her children.

272
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,391
- Me?
- Yes. She referred to it as a joke.

273
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,838
Snicker, snicker.

274
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,748
l told her we fooled around once
and Gino was the result.

275
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,355
Gino?

276
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,117
You told her that you and...?

277
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,037
You thought that she and l...?

278
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,673
Gino?

279
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,833
Your Gino?

280
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,428
You should have seen her face.
Her chin was in her lap.

281
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,110
Of course, laugh at the fool.
Laugh at my expense.

282
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,708
- Show her a picture of Gino.
- Yeah, OK.

283
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,471
You think he's funny-looking. You
wanna see what makes Gino laugh?

284
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,795
- His real dad.
- Let me see.

285
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,556
Look, Whitey, l'm sorry.

286
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,434
l know l can be a real pain
sometimes.

287
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,676
And l know that l take things
a little too seriously at times.

288
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,677
l guess
l need to be reminded of that.

289
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,360
Well, l'll always be there for you.

290
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,072
Listen,
l want you two to shake hands.

291
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,153
You're alright.

292
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,395
Maybe we can go to a movie one night.

293
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,112
Fine. When?

294
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,470
l'll get back to you.

295
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,673
l'm proud of you, l really am,
for holding your own with Carla.

296
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,756
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

297
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,712
Sam, could l ask
a little off-the-cuff question?

298
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,512
Sure.

299
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,029
Who took me home last night?
You or Carla?

300
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,913
You don't remember?

301
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,675
No.

302
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,352
We both did.

303
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,795
Who put my pyjamas on?

304
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,118
- Carla did.
- You'd already left by that time?

305
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,073
No. l was still there.

306
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,079
You mean watching?

307
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,034
No. l was in the other room,
minding my own business.

308
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,551
On my good behaviour.

309
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,671
Trying on your lingerie.

310
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,235
