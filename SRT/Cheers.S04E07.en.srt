1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,590
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,799
Oh, let me help you with that, Sam.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,275
That's okay, Woody.
I'm not as old as I look.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,714
Really?

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,832
Sam, I don't know if this would interest
you, but I have an extra ticket tonight,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,151
Jacques Brel Is Alive
and Well and Living in Paris.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,392
He's not doing that underwater
stuff anymore?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,959
Jacques Brel was a Belgian balladeer
who wrote songs

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,509
of great passion and power
in the '50s and '60s.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,519
You mean like "Who Put the Bop in
the Bop Sh-bop Sh-bop"?

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,358
So you're busy.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,354
"Who Put the Bop"?

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,596
Yeah, you remember that?
The great old song,

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,194
- right up there with "Yakety Yak."
- "Yakety Yak"?

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,918
Oh, come on, you remember
the Coasters, don't you?

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,718
- No.
- You're kidding.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,633
How about the Shirelles
or the Platters or Dixie Cups?

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,349
Sorry.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,275
You don't remember any
of those old groups?

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,671
Oh, old groups. You mean like Devo.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,994
Maybe you better take this.

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,116
Off to class, huh?
What do you got today?

23
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,995
Sissy French Painters
of the 1 7th Century.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,076
As a matter of fact, I'm on my way
to my Beginning Mime class.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,556
- "Meem"?
- Most people pronounce it mime.

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,113
Mime?

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,192
Yeah, you know, Woody, those guys
with white paint all over their faces

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,318
so bouncy and happy you just
wanna strangle them.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,908
You're not serious.

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,640
- Everyone loves a mime.
- No, everybody loves a clown.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,394
Everybody hates a mime.

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,993
That's simply not true.

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,674
Well, you know, I saw this guy
on the Common one day.

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,353
Did an amazing performance.

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,990
He-- He did a crane, a mother crane,
feeding its young.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,596
Turns out the guy was actually
choking on a piece of gum.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,359
But I was moved, frankly.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,154
Yeah, well, you know, Norm, you can
make light of it all you want,

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,799
but it is an ancient art form.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,635
It has been around since the times
of Caesar Augustine.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,429
Yeah? So have those socks
you're wearing. Who cares?

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,434
Well, you know, it is the purest form
of communication.

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,831
Diane, why don't you give us
a little exhibition here.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,472
Oh, I couldn't. I'm really just a novice.
I've only had three lessons. All right.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,072
Oh, all right, ladies and gentlemen,
Diane, the "mimette."

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,991
All right, she's starting off here with
your basic cop directing traffic.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,035
And segueing into a waiter carrying
a heavy tray of dishes.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,355
Yes, good. And completing it with
the midget imitating Judy Garland.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,597
Very nice, bravo, bravo!

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,959
Very good.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,475
It was a person trapped
in a shrinking box.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,316
I'd say you'd better scurry off to class.
You got a lot of practicing to do.

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,596
Now, that I know.

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,196
- Hey, Sammy, mail in?
- Yeah, there you go.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,949
- You expecting something special?
- Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,315
It's too depressing.

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,311
Oh, come on.
We're your buddies here.

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,796
Yeah, you don't wanna keep
that stuff inside, Carla. It'll eat you up.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,399
Oh, yeah, it's just what I need.

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,835
You chowderheads trying
to solve my problems.

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,031
Come on now, I'd say that four brains

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,431
plus whatever Cliffy has
are better than one.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,756
Come on. We wanna help.
Let us help.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,997
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, try this one for size.

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,312
In case you haven't noticed, my luck
with men hasn't been so great lately.

66
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,233
In fact, all my dates fall
into two categories:

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,676
geeks and those studying
to enter the geekhood.

68
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,828
So in order to increase my odds,
I decided to enlist the full resources

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,518
of the media. I put this ad in
the personals of Boston Scene.

70
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,831
So it's been two weeks,
and no one has answered.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,831
Can you help with that?

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,194
- Well, all right.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,352
Give us a second here.
All right, guys?

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,640
- Hey.
- Yeah, what? What do you got?

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,678
You got a crack in
the ceiling there, Sammy.

76
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,359
Just what I thought. Thanks, guys.

77
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,158
Oh, come on, come on
back here, would you?

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,629
We're just kidding now.
Now we're gonna really help.

79
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,432
Hey, why would he write you
here anyway?

80
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,596
Well, you think I want some
sex-starved creep

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,230
camped out on my doorstep? One
of my neighbours might get him first.

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,391
Just let me-- Let me see the ad.
Which one is it?

83
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,597
Right there. Right after
"speed eater seeks same."

84
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,432
All right, all right.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,994
"Divorced female, warm, witty
and ltalian in every way except fat."

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,236
- Well, sounds good so far.
- Yeah.

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,472
"Thirty-three, 5-foot
and a quarter inch,

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,111
dark brown hair, brown eyes,
no visible scars, tattoos or birthmarks.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,878
Seeking possible serious relationship.

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,871
Note, I have six children.
This is not a misprint. Six."

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,555
Oh, my, I can't believe not
one guy has answered this.

92
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,036
Carla, my dear, you're forgetting,
like, the basic principle of advertising.

93
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,998
Lying.

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,948
Oh, sure, I could tell him
I got no kids, right?

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,635
- Right. Right.
- I could tell him that I'm 21, 5'9",

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,552
- Right.
- gorgeous green eyes,

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,190
flaming red hair
and ta-tas till Tuesday.

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,033
But how am I gonna explain the way
I really look when he sees me?

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,559
Stress?

100
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,878
Hey, all right, next time I spill my guts,
remind me to do it in front of friends.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,878
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- I am in no mood to be cheered up.

102
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,794
Next guy tries to cheer me up
is gonna get open-face surgery.

103
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,594
I don't get it. She's got ta-tas
till Monday afternoon at least.

104
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,634
Boy, she's really bad off.
Come on, come on, listen,

105
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,512
we gotta think here now.
All right, come on,

106
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,071
put ourselves in her place. What would
I do if I couldn't get a date?

107
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,719
Who am I kidding?

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,071
- Well, why don't one of us write her?
- You wanna date her?

109
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,869
No, no, no. No, I think he means,
why don't we make up a guy?

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,479
I don't know, man. Make up a guy,
it's just too risky. Too risky.

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,433
Yeah, she'd suspect something
the minute she met him.

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,557
No, no, no, we wouldn't have
to let it go that far.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,792
In the meantime, we're giving her hope,
a little confidence. The more confident

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,838
she is, the more attractive she'll feel.
That'll make her more attractive

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,718
to some real guy.
Or something like that.

116
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,279
- Sounds good.
- All right, I'm in.

117
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,795
- Okay?
- Yep, we got two.

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,678
All for one, one for all, huh?

119
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,395
Gee, Mr Clavin, your hands
are soft like a girl's.

120
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,551
My feet have got calluses on them,
just like every other part of my body.

121
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,871
Woody, get me some paper there.
Hey, Carla's gonna love this,

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,838
don't you think? I hope she realizes
what great friends she has here.

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,918
You bet. She will. And if she doesn't,
what do you say we just have

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,911
- this guy dump all over her?
- Good idea.

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,793
- We don't have any with lines.
- That's okay, I'll be careful.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,194
Okay, before we start writing,

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,635
I suggest we just figure out
who exactly this guy is.

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,189
No, we're making him up.
He can be anybody we want him to be.

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,349
Doctor, ski instructor--

130
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,159
No, that's the point. If the guy's too
fabulous, she'll be on to us.

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,476
All right, it's gotta be
somebody, though, who's not

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,039
in her league usually.

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,390
We could make him a postman.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,833
- No, no, too much.
- No, no.

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,430
Boy, you guys, we're sunk already.
She asked for a picture.

136
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,473
Yeah? Now, wait-- Wait a second.
Here, we're back afloat here.

137
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,756
Check this out.
How's this for your basic stud?

138
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,599
- Oh, oh, nice.
- Oh, nice, great. Who is he?

139
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,598
No idea. Just came with the wallet.

140
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,634
Hey, look at this.
Letter for Carla Tortelli.

141
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,354
- What?
- My goodness.

142
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,308
- Let me see. Come on, come on!
- What's the magic word?

143
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,755
- Gelding.
- That's the one.

144
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,308
What is it, Carla?

145
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,519
Someone or thing had the nerve
to answer my ad.

146
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,998
Okay, everybody, gather around
for a good laugh.

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,192
"My dearest Carla,

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,592
I was intrigued by your warm,
honest ad.

149
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,708
I'll be candid as well.
I was married myself,

150
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,190
but, sadly, it failed.

151
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,909
I'm not much for bars
or the singles scene.

152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,516
I prefer a quiet night, a warm fire
and pleasant company."

153
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,992
- Very sensitive, very sensitive.
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,311
"I'd love to meet you soon,
but unfortunately my job

155
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,948
as an international airline pilot

156
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,393
keeps me real busy flying places
most people only dream about."

157
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,200
- Talking adventuresome.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,318
"For the moment, then, we'll have to
depend on the U.S. Postal Service."

159
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,192
No trouble there.

160
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,353
"Sincerely, Mitch Wainwright.

161
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,399
- P.S., I love kids."
- Oh, no, you're kidding me. Boy.

162
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,393
You really hit the mother lode
there, didn't you?

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,795
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

164
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,188
What do you want?

165
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,399
Well, I guess he does sound
kind of great.

166
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,272
- You bet he does.
- Yeah.

167
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,399
Carla, you have no way of knowing
if this man is telling the truth

168
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,711
- about himself.
- Don't you think I've thought of that?

169
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,997
But if this guy is only half as good
as he sounds, he's twice as good

170
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,720
as any of the dirtbags I've ever dated.

171
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,189
- I just wish he'd sent a picture.
- He did.

172
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,197
- What?
- Probably. He probably did.

173
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,755
- Yeah.
- Check in the envelope there. Check.

174
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,632
- There is a picture.
- You're kidding.

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,109
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey.

176
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,353
- Come to Mama.
- Oh, look at that guy.

177
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,879
- Handsome.
- Oh, yeah.

178
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,555
Hey, how about that?
Good times, huh?

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,790
- Yeah.
- There's something suspicious

180
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,669
- about this whole situation.
- No, there's nothing suspicious here.

181
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,473
- How do you know?
- I know. I know.

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,596
Sam, is this your handiwork?

183
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,714
I can't believe you did something
this stupid.

184
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,354
She was depressed. We were
trying to help her out. That's all.

185
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,155
Nothing's going to top the depression
of going after the man of her dreams

186
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,995
and finding you there. Believe me,
I know whereof I speak.

187
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,073
There's no way she's gonna find out.

188
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,477
Hey, this guy looks familiar.

189
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,510
- Where have I seen this face before?
- Probably the airport.

190
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,999
- Yeah.
- Pilots hang out there.

191
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,720
- All the time.
- I got it.

192
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,269
He's in a frame I just bought
at Woolworth's.

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,154
You're kidding.

194
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,599
Oh, my God. He's a model too.

195
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,829
Is that right?

196
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,156
So did Carla get the latest edition
of the Mitch Gazette yet?

197
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,351
Yeah, she's in the back reading
it right now.

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,395
Have you noticed how Carla is
kind of perking up lately?

199
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,394
I'll admit she's much less repulsive.

200
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,070
Bordering on sufferable, but that
doesn't make what you're doing right.

201
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,708
Oh, come on, give her her moment
in the sun there.

202
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,798
I mean, after all,
you had yours with me.

203
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,794
You're not referring to that
nanosecond under a penlight are you?

204
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,991
Oh, no, what--?

205
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,958
- What is that?
- A little surprise I have for you, Sam.

206
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,636
I hate surprises. And you know
what else I hate.

207
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,512
Bravo!

208
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,875
Sam, I'd like you to meet
Lev Agajanian,

209
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,271
better known as Sotto the Mime.
Sotto, this is Sam Malone.

210
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,991
Oh, hi. Oh, that's very funny,
very funny.

211
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,074
- Get him out of here, please.
- Sam, be nice.

212
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,471
Sotto is our mime-in-residence at
the college and a visitor to this country.

213
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,633
- Whatever.
- Hi! My name's Woody Boyd!

214
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,958
- Woody, you don't have to shout.
- Oh, he's a lip-reader.

215
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,749
Sam, what would you say if I told you
that Sotto has generously offered

216
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,433
to entertain your customers?

217
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,397
- No.
- Oh, please.

218
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,198
- No.
- I predict that by the end

219
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,591
of the evening you'll have
fallen in love with this art form,

220
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,797
and Sotto will have picked up
a lot of spare change.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,197
See, this is the stuff I hate.

222
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,877
Sam, this is his art.

223
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,510
- Well, just keep his art out of my face.
- Thank you, Sam.

224
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,148
Hey, would you please get off
my bar there?

225
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,673
You won't regret this.

226
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,109
Oh, so where's your flyboy
off to this time, Carla?

227
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,273
Cairo. He's gonna buzz the Sphinx
for me in his 747.

228
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,992
Good Lord.

229
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,795
Even the stick's jealous. I just can't
wait to meet this guy face to face.

230
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,269
Although I am gonna play hard to get.

231
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,830
I intend to meet him
with all my clothes on.

232
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,234
Carla, since you mentioned it,

233
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,277
when are you going to meet
this Mitch fellow?

234
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,635
Well, he's doing the Paris
to Bombay flight now.

235
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,712
I have to wait until they switch him
back to the domestic route.

236
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
- You know, life's funny.
- Why is that?

237
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,634
I mean, today I'm with Mitch
on top of the world.

238
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,439
And just a couple of weeks ago,
I'd have settled for fish bait

239
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,036
- like Vinnie Claussen.
- Who's Vinnie Claussen?

240
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,596
Some loser who had the nerve
to answer my ad.

241
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,756
Carla? Yeah, wait, wait,
hold on a second here.

242
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,878
Listen, maybe you should
reconsider this.

243
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,395
- You know, Mitch is out of town a lot.
- Yeah.

244
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,154
Maybe you might like this Vinnie guy.

245
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,351
Yeah, there's nothing wrong
with playing the field.

246
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,636
Except with someone
who's grazing in it.

247
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,950
- What are you talking about?
- Look at this guy.

248
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,599
Fetch.

249
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,635
Really, take a look at him.
He's not that bad-looking.

250
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,712
Yeah, but next to Mitch
he looks like a weasel.

251
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,677
But looks aren't everything, Carla.

252
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,394
I mean, Vinnie, I bet he's got
a lot of stuff going for him.

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,472
Oh, I don't know about you, but being
a funeral director seems darn near

254
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,598
- as thrilling as aviation to me.
- Yeah, they got flowers, limousines.

255
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,958
Hey, forget it, forget it, all right?
I'm through with bozos like that.

256
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,078
I'm at the University of Mitch now.

257
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,076
Well, I hope you're all
proud of yourselves.

258
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,312
Carla is now turning down living,
breathing human beings

259
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,277
for your mythical aviator.

260
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,790
Guys, how come we didn't see
this one coming?

261
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,995
Oh, this from a group who every year
fails to see winter coming.

262
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,588
Thanks for reminding me, Diane.
I gotta take those screens down.

263
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,115
Hey, Sam, what time does
the floor show end?

264
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,157
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

265
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,993
Hey, come here, come here,
come here.

266
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,789
Listen, Sotto, we gotta talk.

267
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,436
Yeah, all right, all right.
Now, don't do this.

268
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,195
Listen, the whole--

269
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,669
That's very clever, yeah.

270
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,389
Listen, you've been here three hours.
This is just not working out.

271
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,551
I'm gonna start losing customers here.

272
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,234
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

273
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,431
Now, I want you to beat it.

274
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,238
Oh, God, don't tempt me, man.
Don't...

275
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,470
- Sam, is there a problem?
- Yeah, get him out of here

276
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,074
before there's clown white
all over the walls.

277
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,469
- Yeah.
- Sotto.

278
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,994
I think my attempt at enlightening
Sam has failed.

279
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,673
I'm afraid you're going to have to go.

280
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,759
So I'll see you tomorrow.

281
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,312
I know. I know
what will win them over.

282
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,790
Do your robot that winds down.

283
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,389
Wonderful. You're a master.
What control.

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,990
Mime putting.

285
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,236
Same time tomorrow?

286
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,590
He spoke! It's a miracle!

287
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,671
Yeah, okay, all right.

288
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,913
From now on nobody works in this bar
that wears more makeup than you do.

289
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,678
All right.

290
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,518
Excuse me.
My name is Vinnie Claussen.

291
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,798
How do you do?
Well, you don't look like a weasel.

292
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,715
Thank you. Neither do you.

293
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,991
- Is Carla Tortelli here?
- Oh, just a minute.

294
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,312
Hey, Carla?

295
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,758
- Vinnie Claussen is here to see you.
- What's he doing here?

296
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,516
You better not watch this, kid.

297
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,993
You're about to see a guy's dreams
dashed on the rocks of Tortelli Point.

298
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,434
- Carla?
- Yeah.

299
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,717
- I'm Vinnie Claussen.
- Yeah, I know, I got your letter.

300
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,319
Already?

301
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,914
Oh, I was hoping to meet you
before you got it.

302
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,469
I don't express myself very well
on paper,

303
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,159
and it's not the best picture of me--

304
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,113
Look, Vinnie, Vinnie, I really-- I don't
wanna see you making a fool

305
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,111
of yourself in front of all these people.

306
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,874
The fact of the matter is
someone beat you to me.

307
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,272
Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that.

308
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,670
Especially now that I've met you.

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,236
Well, I'd offer her as a consolation
prize, but you're probably sick

310
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,359
- of dealing with stiffs.
- Well, I guess I'll be leaving then.

311
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,278
- Yeah, better luck next time.
- Sam.

312
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,558
Vinnie, let me buy you a drink here,
would you? Take care of him.

313
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,718
- Carla, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yep.

314
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,237
So how long you been interested
in dead guys?

315
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,671
Listen, before I start,
do me a favour, will you?

316
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,633
Stick your hands in your pockets
and keep them there till I'm finished.

317
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,671
- What's going on?
- Just humour me, will you?

318
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,237
Okay, but don't start in on me about
going out with this Claussen guy.

319
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,277
I mean, he's all right,
but he's no Mitch.

320
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,436
Listen to me.

321
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,388
Mitch doesn't exist.
The guys and I made him up.

322
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,996
- You what?
- Well, you were so depressed

323
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,754
we figured we had to do something,
so we made the guy up,

324
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,435
wrote the letters and rented a post
office box for you to write to him.

325
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,230
Oh, damn.

326
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,954
- Damn, I forgot the feet.
- You are scum.

327
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,476
You are the scum that scum
scrapes off the bottom of their shoes.

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,389
You're always looking at
the negative side to everything.

329
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,354
I hate your guts. I hate every one
of you. I mean, why did you do this?

330
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,512
What, was it some big laugh, huh? You
wanted to see me get all moony-eyed

331
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,830
and then yank the rug out.
Was that it, get a big laugh?

332
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,070
- No, sweetheart.
- No? Then what did you do it for?

333
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,832
What did you think was gonna
come of this?

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Well, we had that covered.
We weren't gonna let you get hurt.

335
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,154
When it came time to meet the guy,
we were gonna have the plane

336
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,470
go down in the South Pacific.

337
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,838
Damn!

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,754
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Hey, just drop dead twice.

339
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,875
Carla, wait. Wait. Now, there's
something you don't understand.

340
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,595
What they did was imbecilic, moronic
and ill-conceived.

341
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,870
Oh, that's the way, sugarcoat it.

342
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,314
But it was not done to make you
the butt of a joke.

343
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,392
It was done because your friends saw
their dear friend hurting.

344
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,439
And they wanted to help.

345
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,678
Now, you can either walk out
of here angrily,

346
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,638
or you can trust your friends
and forgive them.

347
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,150
And take advantage of the opportunity
seated at the bar.

348
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,195
Come on, why don't you give
the guy a chance?

349
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,955
I mean, he answered your ad.
He's dying to date you.

350
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,559
Hey, where do you think you're going?

351
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,837
- Oh, I finished my drink.
- Sit down!

352
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,432
Nice touch, nice touch.

353
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,512
Does this--? Does this mean
you're gonna go out with him?

354
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,797
- I'm thinking about it.
- All right, okay, okay.

355
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,508
Actually,

356
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,798
in a dimly lit bar he's not
the worst thing I've ever seen.

357
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,670
Writes a good letter.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,834
I'd probably give him as big a thrill
as this Mitch guy was giving me.

359
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,511
Get out of here.

360
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,871
Honey, what do you say?

361
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,352
Oh, all right, you're off the hook.
Just tell me one thing.

362
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,112
Who wrote all those lovey parts?

363
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,992
Oh, that was my department.

364
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,352
You did a real good job.

365
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,275
Well, I'm sorry if I got carried away
there. But with you, it's kind of easy.

366
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,990
So they say.

367
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,999
So how do you feel about girls
on the rebound?

368
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,630
Oh, I've dated a few. Mostly widows.

369
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,838
Yeah. Let's get out of here, huh?

370
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,833
Oh, I know this real nice restaurant.

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,515
Great, great. So you like kids, huh?

372
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,037
Like them? I love them.
I got seven of my own.

373
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,275
- Carla. Carla.
- I'm joking. I'm only joking.

374
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,354
Hey, Vinnie, could you
do me a favour?

375
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,116
I mean, just for tonight, could you
pretend that your name is Mitch

376
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,271
and that you're an airline pilot?

377
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,078
Well, I guess.

378
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,199
If you'll call yourself Raven and
pretend you're a Vegas showgirl.

379
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,835
You're weird. I like that.
