1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,636
OK. Closing time. Everybody out.

2
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:11,550
Harry, how did you get in here?

3
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:13,094
I came in the back door.

4
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:14,971
I don't have a back door.

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,394
Well, then, it's my secret.

6
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,145
I've been serving him all night.

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,530
Diane, you know I don't like
this flimflam man in my bar.

8
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,824
Sam, that's a bit unfair, isn't it?

9
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:33,750
Anyone with half a brain can see
through his petty scams and tricks.

10
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,041
You're too kind. Thanks.

11
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,720
I hope he doesn't try
to pull anything on you.

12
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:43,216
Me? It is to laugh.

13
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:48,853
Diane, I like you, you're smart.
Let me help you clean up.

14
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:52,397
You gotta keep the cover
on this table,

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,576
because the heat from the lights
will crack the felt.

16
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:58,113
Take care of it.

17
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:03,501
Harry, I'll take care of it.
You can leave.

18
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,413
Let me save you a couple of steps
with the check. I'll pay Sam.

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,546
Thanks.

20
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,133
Take care of that table.

21
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:16,676
Men can't make beds, either.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,185
OK, Sam. Thanks a lot. Goodnight.

23
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,357
Harry, the bill.

24
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,773
- It's OK, I paid Diane.
- I don't trust you.

25
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:29,159
Diane,
will you tell Sam it's covered?

26
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,281
It's covered.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

28
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,574
Sorry I'm late,
but wait till you hear what I did.

29
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,241
This afternoon,
I spent five entire hours

30
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,497
in a sensory deprivation tank.

31
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:09,000
Your room?

32
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:11,707
I'm telling you, it was incredible.

33
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:15,177
Never have I felt more aware
of what's going on around me.

34
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,345
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

35
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:22,601
The whole idea is that there's
a total lack of sensory input.

36
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,269
What the hell's going on here?

37
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:27,981
A book promotion party.

38
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:31,032
How can that be
in a place where no one can read?

39
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:35,661
My old roommate, Tom Kenderson,

40
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,164
wrote his autobiography,
and I'm in it.

41
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:46,387
So, it's a press conference for
yet another thick-headed jock epic?

42
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:50,885
There must be confetti
all over the Library of Congress.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,431
For your information,

44
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:55,934
this one's different.
It's got a lot of good stuff in it.

45
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,521
- Like what?
- Well, I haven't read it, actually.

46
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,700
- No, no.
- Didn't want to wear out your lips?

47
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:09,669
I meant to read it last night,
but an emergency came up.

48
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:13,841
- And what was her name?
- Sherry. That's not the point.

49
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:19,308
Tom's book should be really exciting
due to the times we had together.

50
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:22,554
It's about how we handled
the pressures of baseball.

51
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,645
Guys handle it differently.

52
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,728
Some guys turn to the bottle,
some guys chase chicks.

53
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:30,103
Tom and I couldn't make up our minds.

54
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,647
- So you did both?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:37,951
OK, well,
let me speed-read this sucker.

56
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:41,251
And then we can talk.

57
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:46,207
- How long is that gonna take?
- I'm on chapter four.

58
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:51,803
I always loved that kid Tommy.

59
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,427
Just a riot.
He was always pulling something.

60
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:55,560
Is that right?

61
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,226
He put my toothbrush
in his sweaty socks,

62
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:01,402
left dead animals in my locker.

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,156
One time, him and some guys held me
down and shaved my whole body.

64
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,364
You just let him do that to you?

65
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:14,041
No, Cliff. He was trying
to cram me into a clothes dryer.

66
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,045
I pulled his socks
right over his spikes.

67
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:19,170
Good one, Coach.

68
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:23,256
What a laugh the guys got. I could
see them through that little window.

69
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,054
They were laughing.

70
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:26,849
Mayday.

71
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,238
- What a to-do.
- How about this?

72
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,362
Sam.

73
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:38,741
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Carla Tortelli, Tom Kenderson.

74
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,199
Carla, nice to meet you.

75
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,079
I love you, Tom Kenderson.

76
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:48,924
Look, here's my number and
a couple of quotes from past lovers.

77
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,011
- Thank you.
- Come here, sweetheart.

78
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,684
Sam, he breathed on me.
I'm a whole woman.

79
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:58,055
Coach, get her a seltzer.

80
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:03,649
- Sam, did you read my book?
- No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

81
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,739
I really wish you had.

82
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,944
Did you put in that flight
to Kansas City

83
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,081
when we jumped in the garment bag
with two stewardesses?

84
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,782
- Yeah, but...
- Then I'll die happy.

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,088
- Listen, let's get you famous.
- You don't understand...

86
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,673
Tommy, good to see you.

87
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,214
- How you doing?
- Great.

88
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,891
Remember the time you put
the analgesic balm in my jockstrap?

89
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,301
Yeah.

90
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:29,396
I think of you when I get the itch.

91
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:32,776
- lt's good to be remembered, Coach.
- My God.

92
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:35,111
Mr Kenderson, can we begin?

93
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,990
Yeah, let's start. Let's do it.

94
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:43,749
Before we start,
Sam Malone, come up here.

95
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:49,884
You all remember Sam, and if you
don't, chapters seven through nine.

96
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,425
No, I'm a businessman now. I keep
my clothes on, most of the time.

97
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:57,346
So, you two were real close?

98
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,394
For three years we did everything
together. We were never apart.

99
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:06,569
It must've been a shock when Tom
wrote about coming out of the closet.

100
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,494
You mean in Detroit?

101
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:17,248
I was with the waitress, and he
came out of the closet wearing a...

102
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:19,713
That's not it, is it?

103
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,919
Yikes.

104
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,893
Is this some kind of joke?

105
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:32,059
I wanted you to read the book, Sam.

106
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:35,609
It's still hard for me
to tell people from the old days.

107
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:39,904
Sam, you said you two
used to do everything together?

108
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:42,610
No, you misunderstood that.

109
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:46,249
No. As a matter of fact,
people used to come up to me and say,

110
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:50,128
"You two are best friends,
yet you're completely different."

111
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:54,553
Sam, there's an emergency
in the back room.

112
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:59,178
- What?
- I found holes in the pool table.

113
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,558
Yeah.

114
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,101
Will you excuse me?

115
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,189
Some chick wants to see me.
I can't get rid of 'em.

116
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,445
You guys know how it is.

117
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:12,572
So, honey, you can't go
in the back room without me?

118
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,745
Shut up.

119
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,168
Say it ain't so, Tom.
Say it ain't so.

120
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:23,043
Thanks for getting me out
before I made an ass of myself.

121
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,752
I was fast but you were faster.

122
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,428
It wasn't my fault.
He should've told me.

123
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,134
Sam, he told you to read the book.

124
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:32,435
Yeah, but...

125
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,602
He should've known that
you'd have been with a woman

126
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,489
who thinks <i>Candide</i>
is a toenail polish.

127
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,742
I just can't believe it.

128
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,741
The guy was a hound.
He had women everywhere.

129
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,748
We'd go into hotel lobbies,

130
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,712
there'd be three or four women
holding up kids.

131
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,006
He covers that.

132
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:58,511
- Where?
- Here, in this paragraph.

133
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,931
- Want me to read it?
- No, I'll read it.

134
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,972
- Right there?
- Yes.

135
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:06,856
"From the outside, my days
in baseball seemed glorious,

136
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:10,439
but the greater my fear
became of my true sexuality,

137
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:15,784
the more I compensated
with typical Don Juan promiscuity."

138
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:18,122
- Does that explain it?
- I don't know.

139
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,161
I've only read it once.

140
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,676
He was denying who he was.
He's no longer doing that.

141
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,595
I should've known.

142
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:36,190
I remember sitting in a piano bar
and he requested a show tune.

143
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,279
Sam, I do understand
why you're upset.

144
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:50,085
You're afraid that now,
people will think you're...

145
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:52,251
No, I'm not upset.

146
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:57,630
It's just that guys should be guys,
Diane. That's all.

147
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,479
Sam, look.

148
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,847
Your friend Tom's out there.

149
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:09,684
He needs your support now
more than ever before.

150
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:12,527
He really hasn't changed.

151
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:16,953
He's still the same guy you used to
tinkle off balconies with.

152
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,505
Boy, the world
was a lot simpler then.

153
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:30,797
Sam, I'm sorry about all this.

154
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,306
I thought you'd read the book
and it was cool.

155
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:37,186
I don't wanna cause you any more
problems, so I'm gonna take off.

156
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,531
Damn it.

157
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:52,872
Thanks a lot, everybody.
It was nice talking to you all again.

158
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:54,831
So long, Tommy.

159
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:57,007
Tom?

160
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,134
You still a gin-and-tonic man?

161
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,348
Way to go, Mayday.

162
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:08,607
I make 'em the way you like 'em.
On the house. Coach.

163
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:17,153
- Thanks a lot, Sam.
- Can we get more shots of you guys?

164
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,782
Yeah, sure. You bet.

165
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,241
I appreciate this, Sam. I really do.

166
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:26,131
You didn't dump me
when I had a drinking problem.

167
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:29,923
I sure did.
You were passed out at the time.

168
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,134
Where are these photos gonna run?

169
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,762
I don't know. Mostly local papers.

170
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:42,277
What's the matter?

171
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:46,189
Same thing will happen at Cheers
that happened at Vito's Pub.

172
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,512
Sam looks as terrific in
black and white as he does in colour.

173
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,763
Looking at Tom breaks my heart.

174
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,347
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi, Sam.

175
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:13,934
We were looking at your kisser
in the morning rag here, Sam.

176
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:15,649
Yeah, I saw that.

177
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,532
Every time I look at this,
I feel so proud of you.

178
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:21,988
I'm kinda glad I did that now.

179
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:26,039
You're taking real strides
in your development as a human being.

180
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,579
A couple of other chicks
said so, too.

181
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:32,300
This human-being image will get me
more action than cheap wine.

182
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,841
Always the high road.

183
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,104
Norm?

184
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:44,192
What was that you said yesterday,

185
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,358
when they were taking pictures,
about Vito's Pub?

186
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:51,193
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
- Talk to me, Norm.

187
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,082
Norm, it's best he hears it from us.

188
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,080
Well, go ahead, tell him the story.

189
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:01,547
- You heard of Vito's Pub?
- It's a gay bar, right?

190
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:05,842
Didn't used to be. It used to be
a great bar. I hung out there myself.

191
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,134
What a story, Norm.

192
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,984
- I'm not finished.
- There's more?

193
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:18,568
One night Vito lets a gay group
hold a meeting in the back room.

194
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,571
Gays For The Metric System,
or something.

195
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:25,707
Story got in the newspaper.
Gets a lot of attention.

196
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:30,794
Next thing you know,
Vito's Pub turns into Vito's Pub.

197
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,383
All the regulars left, Sammy.

198
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,678
Out went the oars and the moose
heads, in came plants and ferns.

199
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,222
Ferns.

200
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:43,850
I just don't want that to happen
at Cheers.

201
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,855
I don't believe it.
Bars don't turn gay overnight.

202
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:50,488
You don't have to believe me.
I have scientific proof. Cliff?

203
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,029
- It happened.
- See?

204
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,324
Excuse me.

205
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,995
You're talking about them
like they're ogres.

206
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,545
The fact is, there are gay people
in this bar all the time.

207
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,716
No way. I haven't seen
a gay guy in here in ages.

208
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,768
- So you can spot a gay person?
- A mile away.

209
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:15,561
And there are none
in here right now?

210
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:19,731
Nope. Looks like
a straight crowd to me.

211
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,365
Too ugly to be gay.

212
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,867
Too ugly to be out.

213
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:35,712
I wasn't going to say anything,
but you've proved you're open-minded.

214
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:40,260
There are two homosexual gentlemen
in this bar at this moment.

215
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,517
Come on. Get outta here.

216
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:46,266
They told me they were gay,
and they appreciated what Sam did.

217
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:50,650
That's right. They're here right now
and you don't even know who they are.

218
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:56,783
Nah, she's kidding.
Everybody here checks out alright.

219
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,203
Well, I don't know.

220
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:06,218
It occurs to me that... Cliff
hasn't had a date in quite some time.

221
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:08,137
He's right.

222
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:13,889
Yeah? How come we've never seen this
Vera you're allegedly married to?

223
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,937
Could we have a couple of beers,
please?

224
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,481
You bet.

225
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,359
Patty-cake alert.

226
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:26,278
- You're Sam Malone.
- Right.

227
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:29,618
- I saw your picture in the paper.
- That's good.

228
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:32,041
Can't wait to read that book.

229
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:35,672
I'm not much of a baseball fan,
but it sounds interesting.

230
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,136
- It should be pretty good.
- Could we have light beers?

231
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,304
Light beer.

232
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:46,436
- There you go.
- Thanks.

233
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,517
Sam, those guys look OK to me.

234
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:52,865
They are OK, Coach.

235
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:56,159
Maybe we are a little off base, Norm.

236
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:58,657
Let's test them out.

237
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,499
I got an idea.

238
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,960
Look at the bagonzas on that babe.

239
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,636
This is medieval.

240
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:12,884
I never knew
Lorne Greene had bagonzas.

241
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:18,475
Say, Jack, change channel.
It's time for the Benito-Venito bout.

242
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,483
Should be a blood match.

243
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:24,813
They're not watching.
Let's string 'em up.

244
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:30,700
What are we gonna do
about these guys?

245
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:35,250
Carla, you're not
prejudiced against gays, are you?

246
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:38,217
I'm not exactly crazy about them.

247
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:42,010
I mean,
I get enough competition from women.

248
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,679
If guys keep
coming out of the closet,

249
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,804
there won't be anybody left to date,

250
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:49,395
and I'll have to start
going out with girls.

251
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:57,401
Don't worry about me. I like
my dates more masculine than you.

252
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:59,529
Not much, but a little.

253
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:05,461
I can't believe you're making
such a fuss over two guys in a bar.

254
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:11,136
- Patty-cake.
- It's an orgy.

255
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,015
Ferns, Sammy. We're talking ferns.

256
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:18,013
Come on. I've seen you guys hug.

257
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,354
- Yeah, but we hate it.
- Right.

258
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:26,610
Cliff, I haven't been to Clancy's
in ages. ls it still a nice place?

259
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:29,234
I don't know.
I haven't been there for a while.

260
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,660
- Let's go on over there.
- Good idea.

261
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,365
Clancy's? Give me a break.
You're kidding?

262
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:39,166
We'll check in in a few weeks and see
if Cheers is still the kind of bar

263
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,386
where a single woman
can be assured of being harassed.

264
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:44,969
Get back here, all of you, right now.

265
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:50,140
You mean to tell me
you guys are baling out on me?

266
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:53,608
I'm telling you, within a month
there'll be wild music

267
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:56,655
and guys dancing
and exchanging phone numbers.

268
00:17:56,782 --> 00:18:00,616
You know, Sam, you've got
some really great friends here.

269
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,035
You've gone out of your way
to make a bar

270
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,666
where customers can feel
like they belong, part of a family.

271
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:10,747
- Now they're walking out on you.
- We don't want them.

272
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,340
Quiet.

273
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:21,229
Perhaps we should
step into the back room.

274
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:25,819
Anyone having something
intelligent to say can follow me.

275
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,403
Fine. Anyone with a two-bit opinion.

276
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:33,080
Alright. I'll tell you.

277
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:47,551
Sammy, I've got a simple solution
to this whole problem.

278
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:50,805
You just go up to the guys
and politely ask them to leave,

279
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,727
and everything is back to normal.

280
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,896
Sam would never do that.
Would you, Sam?

281
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,112
No.

282
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:05,124
I'm not sure.
These guys are my regulars.

283
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:07,041
If I lose them, I lose my bar.

284
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:12,331
If single women stop coming in here,
I have no reason to live.

285
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,968
No emotional appeal here, Sam. This
is a purely intellectual argument.

286
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,274
You let this bar go gay, you are
gonna have to hire male waitresses.

287
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,024
Right?
That means I'm out on the street,

288
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:32,735
and I'm not gonna be able to feed
little Sammy Tortelli.

289
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,414
He kicked.

290
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,375
What?
What's that he's trying to say there?

291
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:45,797
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

292
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:50,015
Please don't let Sammy do this to us.

293
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:53,390
Thanks for
keeping emotions out of it.

294
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,607
I think it's a trick, Sam.

295
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,400
- Sit down.
- We're all agreed, then.

296
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,781
Sammy tells these guys to leave,
we don't go to Clancy's.

297
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,455
- Alright.
- Sam.

298
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,667
Just leave me alone.
I'm running a business here.

299
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,455
What do you think
I should say to them?

300
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:17,046
It's very simple.

301
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,558
You just say, "Hello,
we're a group of snivelling bigots

302
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,012
and we don't care for your kind."

303
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,891
That's good. I like that.

304
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,370
Hi, fellas.

305
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:43,248
Hi, Sam. What's going on?

306
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,004
I've got a problem.
Maybe you can help me out.

307
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:48,212
See, I'm the own of this bar.

308
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:51,432
Yeah, we know. We read the article
in the newspaper.

309
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,970
Right.

310
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:55,808
- That took a lot of guts.
- It really did.

311
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,814
Yeah.

312
00:20:57,943 --> 00:20:59,852
So what's your problem?

313
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:03,106
As a matter of fact,
I don't have a problem.

314
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,160
Coach, get these guys
a beer on the house.

315
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,031
Right, Sam.

316
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,957
Chickening out on us?

317
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:13,750
Yeah, Sammy, I thought
you had more character.

318
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:17,251
Those guys are staying.
Anyone else wants to leave, fine.

319
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,545
You know what kind of bar
this could be?

320
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,347
Not the kind
that I have to throw people out of.

321
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:26,265
That was the noblest preposition
you ever dangled.

322
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,896
Thank you.

323
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:35,315
- Now, let me say this.
- No.

324
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:36,911
Fine.

325
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,157
Alright, gentlemen.

326
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,043
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

327
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,577
What are you gonna do?

328
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:46,707
Coach, last call.

329
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:50,128
What are you talking about?
It's quarter to seven.

330
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:55,425
No time. The glasses have to be
off the tables by seven.

331
00:21:56,313 --> 00:22:00,312
Excuse me. This bar closes at seven?

332
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:06,069
Only on the first Thursday of every
month. <i>Vive la Différence</i> evening.

333
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:11,707
We go home to our wives, girlfriends,
work benches, power tools...

334
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:15,253
This is the weirdest bar
I've ever been in.

335
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,674
Coach, what the hell are you doing?

336
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:22,211
This is <i>Vive la Diff</i>é<i>rence</i> night.

337
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:25,184
- Where the hell did the month go?
- What?

338
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,514
Your regulars
just tricked those guys out.

339
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,644
How?

340
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:38,863
Let's have a round here, Sammy.

341
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:43,204
- What's going on here?
- We got rid of your friends.

342
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,372
It was Norm's idea.
The man's a genius.

343
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,083
Way to go.

344
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:53,464
Norman, there's something
you should know about those guys.

345
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,009
They're not gay.

346
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,301
In fact,
one of them tried to hit on me.

347
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:59,763
What? You said they were.

348
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:04,147
I said there were two gay men here.
I didn't say who they were.

349
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,732
They, along with myself,
have had a wonderful time

350
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:11,284
watching you
make complete idiots of yourselves.

351
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:15,332
Yeah, the guys
I was talking about are still here.

352
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,838
- Right, guys?
- Right.

353
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,510
Better than Vera.

354
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:33,432
