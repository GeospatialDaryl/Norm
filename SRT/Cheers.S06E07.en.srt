                 Yeah.

                  We have a boy.

             No, no, wait, wait.
             It's a girl.       

6
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:17,565
            It's a boy again.   
            This is weird.      

7
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:19,450
 All right, maybe it's a girl.  
             I-I...

00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:22,220

out what Carla is, huh?

00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:28,876
No, Cliff, we're trying to find 
  out what sex my babies are.   

10
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:31,813
See, if the ring goes back      
     and forth, it's a boy.     

11
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:34,416
    If it goes around           
in a circle, it's a girl.       

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,053
 And if it just dangles there   
 doing nothing, it's a Clavin.  

13
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,988
I can tell you                  
something                       

14
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:44,426
we used to, uh,                 
do on the farm.                 

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,294
            We'd take a fresh   
            laid chicken egg    

16
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,962
         and we'd put on a spoon

17
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,031
            and hold it over    
            the woman's stomach.

18
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,567
If it dipped down,              
it was female, if not,          

19
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,269
             male.              

20
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:57,272
  So how often did you predict  
     the sex of the babies?     

21
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,907
Never. This was to predict      
    the sex of the chicken.     

22
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:03,612
All right,                      
you take a spoon, right?

00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,508
        Somebody's already      
        using the pool table.

The lady in question.           

127
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:34,549
Sam, Sam, find out              
where she went to college.      

128
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,616
    Yeah, okay.                 

129
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,717
        Afternoon, Sam.

        Hey, boss.

How's business today?           
        Oh, pretty slow.        

132
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:41,856
        Me and the guys         
      just sitting around       

133
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,758
 talking about where everybody  
      went to... college.       

134
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,096
        You were?               

135
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,463
     Well, I was wondering      
     what it would be like      

136
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:51,833
      to go to... college.      

137
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,536
    Well,                       

138
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,303
        picture a place         
    with 20,000 people          

139
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,039
all acting the way you do.      

140
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,207
Sounds like fun.                

141
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:02,911
Listen, uh,                     
where did you go to...          

142
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,913
            college?            

143
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,882
         The University         
    of... Connecticut.

        ( <i>all laughing</i> )        

145
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,639
  Am I missing something here?  

146
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:16,624
                 No, no, no, no,

      Don't you just love       
  this Yorkshire pudding, Ma?   

153
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,997
    That's a <i>real</i> delicacy.     

154
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,166
  The English didn't think so.  

155
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,519
  Actually, Yorkshire pudding   
 was invented in the late 1770s 

156
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:47,038
    during a beef shortage.     

157
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,024
    A person could be given     
      a little bit of beef      

158
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,527
     and soak up the gravy      
    with the pudding,           

159
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:56,264
  thereby fooling his stomach   
         into thinking

 he was having a fuller dinner  
     than he actually was.      

161
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:03,620
And you wonder why nobody       
      asks us out anymore.

00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,006
      So how was your day?

 If we don't stop these people,

probably about time             

177
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,504
    we got out of this

of a better term, grew up.

I think it's time somebody      
    looked at the scrapbook.

 Yes, Clifford, the scrapbook.

So tall and strong.

raising him from a sapling, Ma. 

225
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:40,477

            out of his branches.

227

when the leaves fell.

      do that, would they?

a little bit silly              

245

and all, Ma, but, uh...         

246
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:40,588
     I'm gonna go out there     
      and sit in my tree.

interestingly enough,           

250
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:59,307
Yorkshire pudding               
was invented in the 1700s       

251
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,042
during a beef shortage.         

252
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:03,511
  All right, stop everything.   

253
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:05,178
  I've got a major news flash.  

254
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,080
I just had lunch                
with Miss Howe's                

255
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:08,516
former college classmate        

256
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,886
and it seems that she           
had a nickname at UConn.        

257
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,253
          Give, give.           

258
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,705
Well, he wasn't sure            
how she came by                 

259
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,941
this appellation,               
but it seems that at some point 

260
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:18,508
during her little               
sojourn there,                  

261
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,796
she became known                
as "Backseat Becky."

             What do you

00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:33,724
                 What that means
                 is when Miss...

00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:34,992
         Cliff, Cliff.          
         Why don't you          

268
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,195
    let someone who's           
      been there, tell it?

              where I come from,

274
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,906
        we used to say something
        about girls like that.  

275
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:49,740
             What?

      about nicknames, you know.

                Did you ever    
                have a nickname?

As a matter of fact, no.

293
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:26,844
        fits her personality.

        Kinda dignified.        

296

      Kinda businesslike.       

297

        Kinda reserved.

         Let me think. Oh, yeah.

     uh, that works for me.     

303
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,988
    I kind of like "Bubba."     

304

Oh, God.                        

305
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,576

the whole sordid story.

Well, actually, no.             

307
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,580
Well, that's because            
there isn't one.

     Don't worry about that.

            I'm looking         
            to buy a new car,   

311
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,953

a Ford lately?

 I guess she gives new meaning  
to the term "four on the floor."

     All right, all right.

    on an explanation,

325
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:43,821
     so my friends thought      
     it would be a huge gas     

326
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,489
  to call me "Backseat Becky."

329
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,479

      to believe it, fine,

        All right,              
     here's the real truth.     

336
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:13,851
     I was very aggressive      
 in college, a real go-getter.  

337
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,254
    I never took a backseat     
        to anyone.              

338
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:21,475
          No. No, no.

00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,998
        No, Mr. Cronin,         
    I'm not listening.

                  any offers,   

342
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,702
and that's final.

I'm sorry if I've               
upset you, Mrs. Clavin.

tell this gentleman, please,    

345

won't listen.                   

349
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,882
Well, that's because            
she has got more sense          

350
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,384
in her bony little frame        

351

than you have                   
in your little finger.

to run the Clavins off our land.

     by marriage, Clifford.

to buy the place back?

enough money for a down payment.

369

Wait a minute.

Can either of you guys          
lend me $50,000?                

371

          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

372
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,379
        I'm sorry, Cliff, you   
        never paid me back      

373
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:50,080
                that million    
                from last week. 

374
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,315
                Well, it's been 
                a pleasure      

375
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,150
        doing business          
        with you, Mrs. Clavin.  

376
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,185
Thank you.                      

377
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,987
                     Uh... uh...

378
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,122
                          There!

379
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,489
             There!             

380
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:02,059
 Now what are you going to do?  

381
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,427
Well, first I'm going           

382
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:06,096
     to take this contract      
      down to the office,       

383
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,497
    and then I'm going          

384
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,333
        to call my wife         
 and ask her what I'm supposed  

385
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,734
to pick up at the grocery store.

386
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,622
Ah, Ma,                         

387
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,607
          but after all we've   
          been through together.

388
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,076
Just last night you were saying 

389
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,644
how much the house meant to you.

390
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,646
Last night I was poor.          

391
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,148
Tonight I'm not.                

392
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,650
I never thought                 
I'd have the chance,            

393
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,618
but now                         
I can go to Florida.            

394
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,721
                Florida? Oh, for
                crying out loud.

395
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:33,590
         Who'd ever want to live
         in that stinkhole?     

396
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,193
Clifford,                       
I'm doing this                  

397
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,729
as much for you                 
as I am for myself.             

398
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,297
You're 39 years old.            

399
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,798
It's time to cut the cord.      

400
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,967
             Ma, I am not       
             leaving that house!

401
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,136
Clifford...                     

402
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,471
                I am not leaving
                that house!     

403
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,175
Well, I'm afraid                
you're going to have to.        

404
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,210
      Oh! Oh, yeah, fine.       

405
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,279
      Go off by yourself.       

406
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:56,813
      See how you like it.      

407
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,649
    After a week of cooking     
        your own meals,         

408
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,484
     doing your own dishes,     
     washing your own hair,     

409
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,718
        you'll be back.         

410
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:15,782
        Oh, well, well, well,   

411
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:19,186
if it isn't the ultimate        
driving machine.                

412
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,488
     Okay, okay, I give up.     

413
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,891
      Look, I'll tell you       
        the real story,         

414
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,025
                but it's kind   
                of personal     

415
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,627
            so can we do this   
            in private?         

416
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:27,794
Sure, you bet.                  
You bet.                        

417
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,631
Say, if you're                  
too embarrassed                 
to say something,               

418
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:31,998
feel free                       
to act it out.                  

419
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,872
    I was living in a           
    women's dorm on campus...   

420
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:38,873
Mm-hmm.                         

421
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,474
            ...and one night    
            a fire broke out.   

422
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:41,709
    Ah.                         

423
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,243
        Well, I didn't have time
        to change my clothes,   

424
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,644
             so I had to run out
             to the parking lot 

425
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,879
        wearing only a teddy;   

426
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:48,883
                black,          
                but see-through.

427
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,735
                All of a sudden,
                I was caught    

428
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,386
        in this fire engine's   
        headlights.             

429
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,005
    I didn't know what to do.   

430
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,057
            I looked all around,
            and suddenly,       

431
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,993
            I spotted this      
            open convertible.   

432
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,595
                I climbed in,   
                and I slunk down

433
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,263
                to the backseat.

434
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:06,600
                 Suddenly, this 
                 hulking fireman

435
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,669
        was standing over me.   

436
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:10,738
             He was magnificent.

437
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:14,808
        I looked in his eyes.   

438
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,760
          I knew what he wanted,

439
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,161
        and I wanted it, too.   

440
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:23,734
          I peeled off his black
          rubber raincoat.      

441
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:26,703
         He ripped off my teddy.

442
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:32,492
            I can still feel the
            heat on my flesh.   

443
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,364
        But it wasn't the fire--

444
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,499
                it was us.      

445
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:41,535
            When it was over,   

446
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:42,836
            I opened my eyes,   

447
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,322
            and I noticed       
            we weren't alone.   

448
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:49,276
            Others had watched  
            and not said a word.

449
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:55,098
        And that's why I'm known
        as "Backseat Becky."    

450
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,267
                Satisfied?      

451
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:11,615
                  Thanks for the
                  story, Carla. 

452
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:14,184
          Here's your ten bucks.

453
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,458
Yeah, the $20 one               
would have killed him.          

454
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,061
So wait a minute.               
Wait a minute.                  

455
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:26,663
Why do they call you            
"Backseat Becky."               

456
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,699
                  That will cost
                  you a hundred.

457
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:32,235
Hey, you know,                  
you're kind of a pig.           

458
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:35,238
Maybe we can be friends.        

459
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:38,976
        Excuse me.              

460
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,345
I've got to find                
Norm Peterson.                  

461
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,548
          Does Mr. Peterson know
          what this is about?   

462
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,050
Never mind.                     
There he is.                    

463
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,752
    Norman.                     
                    Hi.         

464
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:49,987
You got to help me.             

465
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,188
I'm desperate.                  
                    What?       

466
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,457
Cliff's locked himself          
in the house.                   

467
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,959
No, I've tried everything.      

468
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,126
He won't budge.                 

469
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,795
Ours is the last house          
on the block                    

470
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,464
scheduled for demolition,       
and that's today.               

471
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:01,665
I'm at my wit's end.            

472
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,866
You got to help me.             

473
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,868
            I'll talk to him.   

474
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,320
         I'll see what I can do.

475
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,520
            Oh, thank you, Norm.

476
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:09,689
             I hope he doesn't  
             try anything crazy.

477
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:11,825
    The last thing on Earth     
         I want to see          

478
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,661
is my son's face                
on the 11:00 news.              

479
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:18,047
 There's a whole city out there 
      that agrees with ya.      

480
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,556
( <i>machinery clattering loudly</i> ) 

481
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:34,765
( <i>machinery clattering loudly</i> ) 

482
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:39,352
    ( <i>clattering continues</i> )    

483
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,730
( <i>machinery clattering loudly</i> ) 

484
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:53,233
    ( <i>clattering continues</i> )    

485
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,740
    ( <i>clattering continues</i> )    

486
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,877
    ( <i>whistle blows</i> )           

487
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,578
      ( <i>machinery stops</i> )       

488
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,148
  ...the world's biggest ass!   

489
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:10,600
                    Clifford,   

490
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:13,003
          now take off          
     those silly handcuffs.     

491
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,938
            I can't.            

492
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,190
    I flushed the key.          

493
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,258
                         Norman,

494
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,878
    go outside and see          
if you can find some tin snips. 

495
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:21,895
                Ask for Biff.   

496
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,030
  He loaned us the hard hats.   

497
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:30,654
         Clifford, sometimes I  
         really worry about you.

498
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:32,739
Look what they did to Elmer.    

499
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:40,346
        I'm sorry, dear,        
      but what can we do?       

500
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,015
Come on, Ma,                    
you're the one who taught me    

501
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,349
that if you believe             
in something,                   

502
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:44,517
if you really want it,          

503
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,552
then you're just going          
to have to fight for it.        

504
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,438
    The house is sold.          

505
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,907
 They're going to tear it down. 

506
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,592
Well, then I am going           
down with it.                   

507
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:55,712
        Clifford,               

508
00:21:55,746 --> 00:22:00,333
  does this house really mean   
    that much to you?           

509
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:01,634
        Yeah, Ma.               

510
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:03,837
     Yeah, it really does.      

511
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:11,778
      ( <i>voice breaking</i> ):       
    Then it means that much     
          to me, too.           

512
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:15,598
  I don't know what we'll do.   

513
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,833
      We'll find a lawyer.      

514
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,553
            We're going to      
            fight this together.

515
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,187
            We'll save our home.

516
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,323
Oh, Ma, together?               
Really?                         

517
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:25,826
                    Really, son.

518
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:28,778
                        Oh!

going to with that thing?       

521
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:34,334
Cut your handcuffs off.         

522
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:36,603
    Yeah? Well, that's          
    a little bit dangerous!     

523
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:38,956
What? No, no. I'm wearing       
     a hard hat. It's okay.     

524
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,507
          A hard hat?           
  Get that thing away from me!  

525
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,109
         Cut the post!          

526
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,345
  Isn't that a little drastic?  

527
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:47,714
  No, Ma, I think we're going   
  to remodel in here anyway.
