1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,473
- What a great day. Cliff.
- Sammy.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,953
How you doing?

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,434
Something funny?

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,189
A salesman came by this morning
with these new napkins.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,311
Read that one. It's terrific.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,113
- This isn't funny.
- That's not the funniest.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,231
Read some of the others.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,078
- What others?
- Here.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,873
I bought 30 gross. Take your pick.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,668
30 gross of two hunters saying,
"Did I hear a buck snort?"

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,839
No. They're all different, Sam.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,072
Well, I'll be darned.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,072
That salesman.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,831
But two bucks snorting
is funny every time.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,750
You should've asked me first.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,954
Sorry. I was sure you'd love 'em.
These are real conversation starters.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,275
No, this is not
a conversation starter.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,868
- Seen these awful napkins?
- Yeah. They stink.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,074
See what I mean?
The place is a-buzz.

20
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,951
<i>The Sox need a rally, they have</i>
<i>two out in the bottom of the ninth.</i>

21
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,914
<i>The Yanks may have it sewn up</i>,
<i>as they lead 5-0. The pitch.</i>

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,512
- Here's your drinks. Go, Red Sox!
- Miss, which drink is which here?

23
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,677
What does this look like,
the Pepsi Challenge?

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,750
Carla's getting her drinks mixed up

25
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,110
because she's watching
that silly game.

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,231
Snitch face!

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,351
If you'd tried that
at St Clete's School for Girls,

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,597
we'd have given you a pink belly
that glowed in the dark.

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,951
I'd kinda like to see that.

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,790
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm.

31
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,480
- Norman.
- How you doing, Norm?

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,795
Cut the small talk
and give me a beer.

33
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,793
How come you're late?

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,151
The boss kept me after.
I got chewed out a bit.

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,793
Yeah? What for?

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,912
I don't know.
Guess he doesn't have a dog.

37
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,476
Alright. Our prayers are answered.
Normie, babe.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,434
- Yastrzemski's up with a man on.
- The fountain of youth. C'mon.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,393
- Now we'll get something going!
- C'mon now.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,073
- You and me, Yaz. My hero. My man.
- Popped it up! Sox lose again.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,077
You old fossil!

42
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,758
That's it. That does it.

43
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,509
May I have your attention?
I have an announcement to make.

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,112
As of right now, Carla Tortelli
is no longer a Red Sox fan.

45
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,835
No, really, I mean it this time.

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,797
Now stop that, OK?

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,277
Have I said that before?

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,270
Give everybody a drink on me, Sam.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,395
- What's the occasion, Fred?
- My sister, Louise, died.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,919
Congratulations.
Just in the nick of time.

51
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,679
Yeah, I was getting
pretty low on funds.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,791
What's going on?

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,230
Fred here is the youngest
of 12 brothers and sisters

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,557
- of a very wealthy family.
- I never cared for any of 'em.

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,958
Every time one of them dies,
Fred here inherits their money.

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,392
I think that's ghoulish.

57
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,829
So did we,
the first six or seven times.

58
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,194
Remember the night two of 'em
drove off the cliff in the fog?

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,675
- Talk about a party.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,199
OK, how we doing here?

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,357
Yeah, another one, Sam,
but hold the napkin.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,034
What do we have here?
A Red Sox bar?

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,392
Sorry about that, fans.
Another tough one in the loss column.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,394
We're closed.

65
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,150
I just came from a classic massacre
of Boston by the Yankees.

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,955
Tonight on the news,
you can watch the lowlights.

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,513
You know, I can't see
why you people are such bad losers.

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,154
You've had so much experience.

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,390
- Who do you like, the Yankees?
- Another swift Bostonian.

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,112
Yeah, I'm a Yankee fan.

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,959
Back in the real city,
they call me Big Eddie.

72
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,513
Pig Eddie?

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,873
You made good time getting here.
I still hear the TV tubes cooling.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,278
I left right after the Red Sox fans
had their seventh-inning wretch.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,275
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, gimme a draught.

76
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,313
You know, Big Ed,
the Sox are doing OK.

77
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,790
Yeah? Since 1918, the Yankees
have won 23 world championships.

78
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,115
And the Sox, zip.

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,950
Want to talk about major poets from
New England as opposed to New York?

80
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,356
Want to talk about
Nobel Prize winners in medicine?

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,232
No.

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,192
Philistines.

83
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,472
- Fred, another round for everybody?
- No, Louise didn't have much money.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,794
But I'll be back.

85
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,832
My 90-year-old brother, Bob,
is so wired up,

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,679
you can get the Super Station on him.

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,758
- Alright.
- So long, Freddie!

88
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,350
We'll be thinking of him
during the next electrical storm.

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,077
- Bye.
- Night, Freddie.

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,029
- You homesick for the Bronx?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,798
Here.

92
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,190
You'll have to forgive Carla,
she gets overemotional at times.

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,995
But bear in mind,
you are in an alien camp.

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,396
Tact is perhaps
your wisest recourse.

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,512
What did you get,
a vocabulary for Christmas?

96
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,269
How'd you like to take a flying leap
up a knuckle sandwich?

97
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,030
You gather my inference.

98
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,317
C'mon, everybody, take it easy.
We're trying to run a friendly bar.

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,876
Everybody sit back, relax.
Read a napkin.

100
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,913
Great shot, kid.

101
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,759
Well, you must admit,
the man's a jackal.

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,831
I know you.

103
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,996
- What's your name?
- Sam Malone.

104
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,675
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, I usually get it right.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,595
You used to be a relief pitcher
for the Boston Red Sox.

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,518
- That's right.
- Hey, you didn't stink.

107
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,789
Thanks.

108
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,992
As I recall,
you had a darned good hard slider.

109
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,031
And you're schlepping drinks?

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,469
The great Sam "Maybe" Malone.

111
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,953
That is "Mayday".

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,110
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, thanks.

113
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,152
I didn't mean all that stuff.
C'mon, have a drink.

114
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,397
- I don't drink.
- A ball player that don't drink?

115
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,590
He doesn't drink any more.

116
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,637
That's what happened.
And I thought you just lost it.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,039
He licked his booze problem
three years ago.

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,709
What was it like pitching
at two guys at the same time?

119
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,516
What was it like coming in
with bases loaded, and so were you?

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,029
- Easy. I got her.
- It's OK, everybody, I'm fine.

121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,159
Sammy, you get a minute,
you wanna put a head on this here?

122
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,311
- You alright?
- I'd better get this looked at.

123
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,876
Right. There's a doctor
lives right near here.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,788
No, I was thinking
more on the lines of an attorney.

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,592
Here's a guy, he's excellent.

126
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,312
Coach.

127
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,557
No, thanks, I got my own,
and he's damn good.

128
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,514
You're legally responsible
for the actions of your employees.

129
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,599
- You know that?
- It was a stupid mistake. I'm sorry.

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,871
Mistake? That was an assault
in front of witnesses.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,515
I didn't see anything. I still don't.

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,436
Sam, I ain't got nothing
against you, you run a clean bar.

133
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,199
Fire her
and I'll forget the whole thing.

134
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,232
There must be
some other way to settle this.

135
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,510
Yeah? What d'you suggest?

136
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,272
Well, certainly,
an apology's in order. Carla.

137
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,356
I'm willing to listen.

138
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,149
Listen, Sam, you fire her,
or I'm gonna take everything you got.

139
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,598
Well, that's it, happy hour is over.

140
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,151
- What you did was reprehensible.
- You do what you can.

141
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,756
- You talked to your lawyer?
- Yeah, I finally got through.

142
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,235
- What did he say?
- If he's worth a dime,

143
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,670
he said by statute and precedence
this would be a tort.

144
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,712
And there is substantial grounds
for cause of action.

145
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,793
- How did you know that?
- Well, I picked it up in pre-law.

146
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,036
I thought you were an English major?

147
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,438
That was after art
and before psychology.

148
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,348
Is there anything
you weren't in college?

149
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,277
Blonde.

150
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,477
- Check the yearbook, Carla.
- Don't. Just stop.

151
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,158
Sam.

152
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,071
Look, I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
I promise it won't happen again.

153
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,475
How am supposed to I believe that?

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,830
You've flown off the handle
too often.

155
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,313
When?

156
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,036
You don't remember throwing a man's
change at him from across the bar?

157
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,116
The correct change.

158
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,760
Carla, look,
you have a history of being...

159
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,350
- ...abusive with customers.
- I'll handle this.

160
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,230
A history of being
abusive with customers.

161
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,991
Sam, he was insulting you.

162
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,793
You don't know
when you're being insulted?

163
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,710
I appreciate you defending me,
but I'm used to people riding me.

164
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,310
In Yankee Stadium
I had to face 50,000 Eddies.

165
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,876
I can defend myself without
having to call in Spider Lady.

166
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,758
I did make a couple of nice moves.
Like when I...

167
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,872
Carla, sit down. Look.

168
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,435
I'm your friend and I like you.

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,035
But I'm also a businessman, and
as such I don't like what you did.

170
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,314
Look, I could get tough. My lawyer
wants me to do what Eddie asked.

171
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,998
Fire me?

172
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,349
C'mon. That's crazy.

173
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,995
Carla, I could lose the bar.

174
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,479
Sam, you can't fire me.
I need this job. Think of my kids.

175
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,434
If I didn't have this job,
I'd have to stay home with them.

176
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,997
Sam, you're not actually
thinking about it, are you?

177
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,999
- This is Carla we're talking about.
- I know it's Carla!

178
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,112
Excuse me.
May I make a suggestion?

179
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,151
Sure, honey, go ahead. What?

180
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,114
Well, I have a close friend
who is a clinical psychologist.

181
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,550
- That could work.
- What could work?

182
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,911
Well, I don't know,
give the kid a chance to talk.

183
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,955
This friend mentioned to me one time
that he has a therapy group

184
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,356
for people who,
I hope you'll forgive me,

185
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,040
for people who can't control
their tempers.

186
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,312
- You think I'm wacko.
- Nobody used the word "wacko".

187
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,069
You don't have to be wacko
to see a psychologist.

188
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,637
Perfectly normal, happy people
consult psychologists.

189
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,990
In fact, get ready to laugh,

190
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,192
I have consulted him
professionally myself.

191
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,108
Are you one of his better jobs?

192
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,631
I'm trying to help you.

193
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,035
Carla, it might do you a lot of good.

194
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,071
Now you think I'm crazy.

195
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,158
I think you're a person
with a lot of anger inside.

196
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,236
Yeah? Well, stick it!

197
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,910
C'mon, would you?

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,398
Look, I grew up on Federal Hill
with six older brothers and sisters.

199
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,555
I mean, I worked all my life
to get this mean.

200
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,399
Now you're telling me
I have to learn nice?

201
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,318
I'm giving you one more chance.
Take it.

202
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,311
OK.

203
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,276
Look, if I go see Whitey's shrink,
will you let me stay on?

204
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,909
Show me you're serious,
get some help, and I'll keep you on.

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,598
Thanks, Sam.

206
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,469
- Come on, let's go home.
- This is great!

207
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,673
Just great. A minute ago,
everything seemed so hopeless.

208
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,394
We were gonna lose Carla forever.

209
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,954
It's all turned around.
I feel wonderful.

210
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,913
All we need worry about now
is Eddie taking my bar.

211
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,996
That didn't last long.

212
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,710
I'm sorry, pre-law was after
literature and before psycho...

213
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,355
No, wait. Indian studies
totally slipped my mind.

214
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,278
How could I forget that?
It changed my life.

215
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,953
Fine, Eddie. Yeah.
See you in 15 minutes.

216
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,193
- So, Ed's coming over?
- Yeah, he's on his way.

217
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,311
When was he last here, Sam?

218
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,714
Three weeks.

219
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,788
Gee, then he's seen the napkins.

220
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,393
Ed?

221
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,432
You mean that swineherd Ed
that's suing you?

222
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,993
Yeah, that's the one.

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,911
I see what you're doing.

224
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,998
You're taking advantage
of Carla's day off

225
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,910
to bring Ed in and fool him
into thinking you've fired Carla.

226
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,598
It's a crass ploy.

227
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,993
I'm gonna tell him Carla's in therapy
and ask him to understand.

228
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,678
My way's better.

229
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,309
That Ed is not my favourite person.

230
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,718
He's a big pansy making
a big fuss over some intense pain.

231
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,831
How many times did you play hurt?

232
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,555
- Now and then.
- I must've got hit by 100 fastballs.

233
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,800
- In fact, it was my specialty.
- You specialised in getting hit?

234
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,799
- Yeah.
- He led the league in HBPs twice.

235
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,717
Hit By Pitches.

236
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,549
I perfected it
when I was with the St Louis Browns.

237
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,353
I could get to first base
on any pitch.

238
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,190
What I'd do was, I'd get up there
and lean my body into the pitch.

239
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,993
Sometimes I took one
right in the old melon.

240
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,430
But I really
made a science out of it.

241
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,278
I became a master.

242
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,436
Here, try to miss me.

243
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,874
Diane, stand there.

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,709
Now, I got the batter's box
marked off back there

245
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,831
at exactly 50 feet, six inches.

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,520
You ready? OK, here we go.

247
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,478
- Has he done this before?
- Lots.

248
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,754
Diane, in those days, we didn't wear
batting helmets either.

249
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,673
This is ridiculous.

250
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,553
He'll stay there all night
unless you throw.

251
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,319
OK, honey, I'm ready. Let her rip!

252
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,115
- Come on, baby.
- Alright!

253
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,630
- I won't get it anywhere near him.
- That's the whole point.

254
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,916
I'm on my way to first.

255
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,151
Way to hum, girl.
Right on the old honeydew.

256
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,114
I really had to dive for that one,
but I still got the old touch.

257
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,193
Hi, everybody.

258
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,039
Carla. Hi.

259
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,469
It's Carla. And Ed's on his way over.

260
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,676
Thanks for reminding me.

261
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,679
Carla. What the hell are you
doing here on your day off?

262
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,113
I brought my shrink to meet you all.
He wanted to put names with faces.

263
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,958
Dr Graham, this is my boss, Sam.

264
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,479
- How do you do?
- Hi.

265
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,311
- And this is Coach Pantusso.
- Hi. So you're a psychologist?

266
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,237
Our jobs are a lot alike.

267
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,432
Because we both listen
to people's problems all day?

268
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,630
Well, there's that, too.

269
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,830
It's really nice to meet you, Doctor.

270
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,157
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Diane. How are you?

271
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,398
- In what sense?
- Pardon me?

272
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,069
You mean, "How are you?",
not "How are you?"

273
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,998
- If that's what you meant, I'm fine.
- Good.

274
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,430
It's good to see you,
but I should get back to work.

275
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,597
Nothing personal,
I'm just a hard worker.

276
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,713
- Not that I'm obsessed with work.
- Diane, get some pretzels.

277
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,393
Hi, Sam.

278
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,438
What's she doing here?

279
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,111
Ed, why don't you sit down
way over there?

280
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,554
Listen, I asked you over here
to talk about Carla tonight.

281
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,272
She's still working here.

282
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,393
I thought my attorney
made my position clear on that.

283
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,317
Well, yes, he did.

284
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,192
Table for one. Sit down.

285
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,433
See, Carla is seeing a therapist.
She's trying to work things out.

286
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,270
She wants to be the kind of waitress
that you'd enjoy being waited on by.

287
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,589
You just ended that sentence
with two prepositions.

288
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,109
Don't you have customers
to deal with?

289
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,435
That ended with a preposition, too.

290
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,030
Don't you have customers
to deal with, mullet-head?

291
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,393
Look...

292
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,357
So, you're in therapy?

293
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,438
Yes.

294
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,917
I've come a long way, though.

295
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,156
Well, I don't believe it,
and I want you outta here.

296
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,273
Ed? It's a long process.

297
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,628
- Sometimes...
- Sam?

298
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,878
Ed, gimme a break.

299
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,350
I've been working damn hard
and I'm better.

300
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,119
- Yeah?
- Yes.

301
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,039
Boston... stinks.

302
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,598
- This bar stinks.
- No, it's alright.

303
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,711
You're a crummy waitress.

304
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,478
- Wait a minute.
- Let it go.

305
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,239
- You're doing wonderfully.
- Hang in there.

306
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,996
You're short.

307
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,755
You're obnoxious.

308
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,270
- You're a terrible dresser!
- That's low.

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,675
Sam Malone was a terrible pitcher!

310
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,432
Ted Williams was overrated!

311
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,715
- Bobby Orr was a wimp!
- Eddie, I'd stay away from hockey.

312
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,110
I hit a soft spot, huh?

313
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,639
OK.

314
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:05,039
The Bruins are a bunch
of ugly, stupid sissies!

315
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,599
C'mon, Ed,
how much more do you need?

316
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,558
OK, Sam.
I'm gonna drop the whole thing.

317
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,598
Working here is punishment enough.

318
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,280
I wish you hadn't said that
about the Bruins.

319
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,118
Why, you a Bruins fan?

320
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,390
No.

321
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,829
I'm a Bruin.

322
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,711
Let me walk you to your car.

323
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,032
I wanna show you some of those
sissy things I got suspended for.

324
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,511
Alright!

325
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,918
- Carla, that was wonderful.
- I'm so proud of you.

326
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,474
- A new woman.
- My psychologist...

327
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,397
Carla, how did you do it?

328
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,069
Nothing to it. I've been working
on this, haven't I, Doc?

329
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,796
We had some great sessions. I just
used this trick Dr Graham taught me.

330
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,230
I imagined a small point
way off in the distance...

331
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,114
- Carla. Where's that beer?
- Shut up! We're celebrating!

332
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,472
I just kept thinking of that point.
He never fazed me, I'm telling you.

333
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,909
With a little deep breathing...
