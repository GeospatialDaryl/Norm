00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,840
THE BELLES OF ST. CLETES

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,629
- Morning, Sammy.
- Norm. What brings you in this time?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,315
- Same thing that always does.
- A little early for a beer.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,835
So float a cornflake in it.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,189
Beer it is.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,719
Seriously,
how come you're here this early?

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,635
My supervisor had to go home early.
So he left me in charge of the office.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,950
So l closed it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,949
Thought l'd stop by, have a few beers
and figure out what to do with the day.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,238
After all, l have 24 golden hours
to spend on Norm Peterson.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,431
- Any suggestions?
- l'd be out there sailing.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,036
Perfect weather,
the waters won't be crowded.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,192
l get seasick, though. l don't know.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,512
Well, you can always go to the driving
range and work on your slice.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,433
No, l don't have my clubs with me.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,479
How about checking out that gym
you've been putting off joining?

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,790
l'm not in the mood for sweat.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,949
- Set up that workshop in your garage.
- l'd have to clean it all out first.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,908
You could sit here all day shooting down
my ideas and drinking beer.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,150
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,910
l think we're onto something. Let's
hear some more of those suggestions.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,834
- Let's see, how about skydiving?
- Nah, mess up my hair.

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,629
There's a lovely young thing.
Perhaps l should just go make my move.

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,314
Yeah, go ahead and faint.

25
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,514
Yeah, all right.
Some of you have gotten the impression

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,240
that l'm inexperienced
in the ways of love.

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,598
How many women do l have to conquer
to lay to rest this misconception?

28
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,796
One.

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,079
All right. l wasn't going do this, but
look what l got in the mail this morning.

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,630
- What does that say?
- ''lnflatable Surprises Catalogue.''

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,954
My mother sent away for it.
She likes to play tricks on the cat.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,629
This is the one l was looking for.
What's the name on there?

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,110
Lanette Cahill.
The Orange Blossom Motel.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,236
Cliffy, who's this?

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,997
Some damsel in Florida who l had
a delightful affair with while visiting.

36
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,869
Poor thing. She just keeps begging me
to come back to her.

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,508
We're not falling for any of this.

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,150
Why don't you believe
that Cliff had an affair in Florida?

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,356
- What?
- l believe him.

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,513
l mean she could have been drunk,
blind, just out prison...

41
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,475
- Thank you.
- Carla, you got a customer.

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,392
Thanks.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,430
Honey, what is it? ls it the baby?

44
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,309
- Baby, hot water, Sam.
- What's going' on?

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,871
- What? What happened?
- lt's her. lt's the Evil One.

46
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,713
- Where? What?
- Over there at table five.

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,231
- The little old lady?
- Drusilla Dimeglio.

48
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,592
She was the principal
at St. Clete's School for Wayward Girls.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,229
We all hated her guts. She used
to do these mean, spiteful things to us.

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,234
l swore vengeance but
she retired before l could do anything.

51
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,470
20 years later, there she is.

52
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,949
lt's been 20 years.
Are you sure it's her?

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,237
There's one way to make sure.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,358
She has my teeth mark on her left ankle.

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,633
- Go check it out, Sam.
- OK, all right.

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,955
- What am l going for?
- l can't do it.

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,671
She'll recognise me and then l'll lose her.
Come on, you got do this for me.

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,876
Why don't l just ask her name?

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,033
That would arouse suspicion.
Crawl over there and look at her ankle.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,115
Much better. No, l am not going
anywhere. Go wait on her yourself.

61
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,236
All right, l will.

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,518
You all just watch and see what happens
when she gets a look at me.

63
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,512
- What will you have?
- l'll have gin and grapefruit juice.

64
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,953
She doesn't recognise me.

65
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,954
That means that l can take my time
and work out my plan for revenge.

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,033
- She did have a mark on her ankle?
- Mark, schmark. lt must have healed.

67
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,555
l'll think of something slow and hideous.

68
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,029
- l have a suggestion.
- What?

69
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,430
- Do nothing.
- With the body?

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,956
No, l'm telling you
to turn the other cheek.

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,271
Mooning her isn't enough.
l want to hurt her.

72
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,998
We haven't had any heat for hours.

73
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,630
What can you recommend
that's nice and hot?

74
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,950
Speaking.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,152
Must you inject sex into even
the simplest of conversations?

76
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,313
l didn't want you to go without it
while you were in Europe.

77
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,831
- l want for nothing in Europe.
- l'm sure that's what you're getting.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,956
You know what l mean.

79
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,468
ln fact, l think l see my shushing hunk
skiing down the mountain right now.

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,237
Yes, that's Frasier. He's able to ski right
down to the back door of our chalet.

81
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,756
Sam, l have to go.
l'll call you right back.

82
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,992
- Thank you, good people of the Alps.
- Bravo, bravo.

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,517
Thank you. Give me a minute here.
That's quite a hill, isn't it?

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,753
- You were magnificent. Magnificent.
- That was exhilarating.

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,668
lt worries me.
These risks you're taking.

86
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,995
Some men live their lives avoiding
danger. Frasier W. Crane seeks it.

87
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,314
Frasier, let me put these away
for you so we can both get off our feet.

88
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,837
You just relax
and make yourself comfortable.

89
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,030
Tonight is your night.

90
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,996
That's the spirit.

91
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,632
The capper of all time was when we
glued Sister Scholastica to the radiator.

92
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,075
Who could forget the Frying Nun?

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,517
Those were the good old days.
Life was simple then.

94
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,468
You two started packing it away
at lunch when l said l was paying.

95
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,553
Me and the kid was just trying to keep up
with her quadruplets.

96
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,632
l've already got
six more than l can handle.

97
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,509
- You have only five kids.
- l'm including my husband, Al.

98
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,955
Who, if he touches me again, is dead.

99
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,669
Four mugs and a pitcher for me
and my pals from St. Clete's.

100
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,116
You know something? l envy all of you.

101
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,239
Sure, l'm the one with the education,
the money and the career,

102
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,392
but l'd trade my electrolysis license
in for a family.

103
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,516
Mine's available.

104
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,878
By the way, l can get rid of that little
<i>Fu Manchu</i> you're starting there.

105
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,195
Man of my dreams.

106
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,909
- Sorry, l can't take them anywhere.
- lt's all right.

107
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,640
Four beers for the lynch mob.

108
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,635
Sorry. l didn't mean to ruin
your wonderful surprise there.

109
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,518
Don't go away.

110
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,070
Casanova, any new letters
from your Florida conquest?

111
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,836
Well, as a matter of fact,
l did receive one today.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,356
Each one gets more heart-rendering
than the last.

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,592
She tells me
she'd give it all up just for my kiss.

114
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,751
She must mean her lunch.

115
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,237
- All right, wise guy.
- Come on, let's go shoot some pool.

116
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,152
Good idea, Normie.

117
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,872
You're lucky l used up my aggressive
male hormones with frequent sex.

118
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,510
OK. We're all here. Now
you can tell us what this is about.

119
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,913
l am glad you're sitting down because
you are not going to believe this.

120
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,275
l didn't believe it myself.

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,310
l've found Dimeglio.

122
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,598
- Our principal from St. Clete's?
- l heard she passed away.

123
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,398
Hell wouldn't take her.

124
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,193
She comes in every night at seven, sits
at this table and has a gin and grapefruit.

125
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,516
- And she will be here again tonight.
- So what?

126
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,516
So what?

127
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,389
This is our chance to pay her back
for all those things she did to us.

128
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,473
Carla, that was 20 years ago.
We were just girls.

129
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,076
But we took an oath that we'd get her.
Don't you remember?

130
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,631
She's coming. Get behind the bar.

131
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,837
- Carla, come on.
- Get behind the bar.

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,916
Don't worry. All the hate's going to come
back as soon as you look at her.

133
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,913
- Hey, ladies.
- Get down.

134
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,632
- Hi.
- Hello.

135
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,598
Would you take this table?
That one's taken.

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,875
- What are you going to have?
- Gin and grapefruit juice.

137
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,600
- One gin and grapefruit.
- Coming up.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,754
He liked your order
and l'm going to get it.

139
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,516
What do you think?

140
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,236
That's not her. She was a lot taller.

141
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,191
We were shorter.

142
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,875
l don't think so either.
She was two times as big as that.

143
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,552
She lost weight. She's wearing contacts
instead of glasses. That's her. l swear it.

144
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,837
lt's been a long time,
but l don't think it's her either.

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,515
- So what if it is? Who cares?
- Get down! l care.

146
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,956
lf you don't want to help me,
l'll get her without you.

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,237
- Fine. 'Cause l don't want any part of it.
- Desert me.

148
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,756
Just stay there
because l don't want her to see you.

149
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,198
- What are we supposed to do here?
- Find some way of amusing yourselves.

150
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,792
OK.

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,838
Carla's been moping around 'cause none
of her chums will back her up on this.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,312
She's got so much anger bottled up,
l'm afraid she's going to hurt someone.

153
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,948
And without you here, l'm next in line.

154
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,715
Sam, it would never come to that.

155
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,477
Carla has a means of dealing
with anger that's very effective.

156
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,636
She vents it in small doses to prevent
a build-up that might erupt in violence.

157
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,397
lt's a technique that many hot-tempered,
uneducated people evolve instinctively

158
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,315
and though it's primitive it is as effective
as more sophisticated techniques

159
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,349
cultivated by better-educated
people with gentler tempers...

160
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,829
Stop that, damn it.

161
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,395
Please, just until l'm finished.

162
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,674
Certainly, dearest heart.

163
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,070
Thank you, love of my life.

164
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,070
l'm sorry. What was l saying?

165
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,151
You don't know either?

166
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,199
We must have a rule. When you speak
at least one of us has to be listening.

167
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,114
- Give my best to Frasier. Bye.
- Bye.

168
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,958
Well, may l proceed with my labour

169
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,513
or would my precious like to perform
the task of getting heat in this place?

170
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,070
No, please finish, my reason for living.

171
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,950
You spoiled little conniving...

172
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,875
...treasure.

173
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,630
Two beers, please.
One for me and one for my buddy, Cliff.

174
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,236
Cliff, the fella who's in the john
without this.

175
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,834
The latest letter from his Florida flame.
lt fell out of his pocket.

176
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,391
What a shame. We should get
that back to him as soon as possible.

177
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,156
And indeed we will, Sammy.
Just as soon as he gets out here.

178
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,438
ln the meantime, l think it's imperative
that we hold the letter thusly.

179
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,753
Why?

180
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,119
Because if you were to hold it the other
way, it's an accident waiting to happen.

181
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,316
Witness.

182
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,316
l think we got a problem here.

183
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,715
The trick is going to be to get that letter
into this envelope without reading it.

184
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,110
- l'm game.
- Yeah, why don't you?

185
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,278
- lt no longer fits, Sam.
- No.

186
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,236
Going to have to read this.

187
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,713
''Dear Mr Clavin,
this letter's the last one.

188
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,759
''lf you don't respond, l will turn
the matter over to my attorney.

189
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,516
''l will wait one week for you to pay for
or return the motel towels,

190
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,435
''ashtrays, light bulbs and
shower curtain assembly, including rod,

191
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,513
''missing from your room. Lanette Cahill.''

192
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,673
- The poor guy.
- l was hoping he wasn't blowing hot air.

193
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,195
lnteresting reading?

194
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,037
- l'm sorry.
- l'm more sorry.

195
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,274
Guys, Norm has the letter.
Hey, Steve. Larry, Norm has the letter.

196
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,750
- Just knock it off.
- ls it as hot as Cliff says?

197
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,151
- Let's read it.
- We're not minors here.

198
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,790
My dearest Cliff...

199
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,068
Well, if you must.

200
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,996
l want you.

201
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,116
l want you.

202
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,236
l want you.

203
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,760
You are burning in my heart like...

204
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,588
- Like?
- l can't make this out. Can you, Sam?

205
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,320
- lt's volcano.
- Volcano.

206
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,679
l think of you at night when l go to bed
and in the morning when l wake up.

207
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,515
And l dream about you
in between when l'm sleeping.

208
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,878
Admittedly when most people dream.

209
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,629
You're quite a man, all right.
And that's for darned sure.

210
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,629
And you satisfy every hunger
that l have as a woman.

211
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,636
Respectfully yours,

212
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,838
Lanette Cahill.

213
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,036
Read them the P.S. where she talks
about my sexual prowess in detail.

214
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,158
- Can't make that part out.
- Read it.

215
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,551
l'll help you.
This word here is gargantuan.

216
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,518
All right, Cliff. We've seen quite enough.

217
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,640
- Good night, you guys.
- Good night.

218
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,919
l don't know how to thank you.

219
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,038
l'm just sorry l opened it
in the first place.

220
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,640
- l'll buy you a burger.
- Listen...

221
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,836
- Good night.
- Good night, Sammy.

222
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,992
- There's a way to make it up to me.
- What's that?

223
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,630
Read me the letter again.
You know, the spicy part.

224
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,433
My dearest Cliffie, l want you...

225
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,436
You OK?

226
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,913
l can't believe they didn't recognise her.
l didn't think anybody could forget her.

227
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,317
Face facts, Carla. Nobody recognised
her because that's not the woman.

228
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,836
- But...
- She didn't have scars on her ankles.

229
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,834
That doesn't mean anything.
Criminals have their ankles altered.

230
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,195
- Jeez...
- So they can wear shorts.

231
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,230
You're ranting. You're sounding
irrational. You're beginning to scare me.

232
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,109
l think you have to take
a serious look at yourself.

233
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,034
Yeah, maybe you're right.

234
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,919
What were you going to do
if it had been her?

235
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,993
l had this storybook fantasy
when l was a little girl

236
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,039
about someday coming up behind her
and shaving her head.

237
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,157
l'm glad it turned out
to be somebody else.

238
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,392
- l guess.
- Look at that, will you?

239
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,910
- l'm late.
- You got a date?

240
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,868
- Yeah.
- Go ahead. l'll clean up.

241
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,510
Thank you, Carla.
l thank you and Debbie thanks you.

242
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,597
You're going out
with Janet tonight, bean brain.

243
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,832
Well then Janet really thanks you.

244
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,114
l wanted her as much as you did.

245
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,236
- Good. Someone's here.
- lt's her.

246
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,272
- Can l help you?
- l think l dropped my wallet here.

247
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,795
Well, let me find it for you.

248
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,394
Let me see. l got it.

249
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,757
- Thank you.
- Not so fast.

250
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,754
l have to be absolutely sure
about this, you know.

251
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,117
- What's your name?
- Drusilla Dimeglio.

252
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,076
Thank you.

253
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,596
Do you believe in fate,
Drusilla Dimeglio?

254
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,237
Well, l never thought about it.

255
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,951
Well, why don't you sit down
and we'll have a little talk about it?

256
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,830
- l think you'll find it interesting.
- l'm kind of in a hurry.

257
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,560
One chair. No waiting.

258
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,430
Who's back there?

259
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,989
Sam, is that you?

260
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,835
l was driving by
and saw the lights still on.

261
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,116
- You won't believe this.
- What?

262
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,751
After you left, l was sitting here all by
myself and guess who should walk in?

263
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,751
Drusie.

264
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,230
- Drusie?
- Yeah, Drusilla Dimeglio.

265
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,471
- Carla, bring me another beer.
- Coming up, Drus.

266
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,990
- She's back there?
- We've been playing pool all night.

267
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,233
- We're tight, Sam.
- So it is her?

268
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,359
Yeah, it's her all right.
But you know something, Sam?

269
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,958
After l told her l hated her, she explained
to me why she was so tough on me.

270
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,908
She was just doing her job.
And maybe l'm a better person for it.

271
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,074
- Anyway, we're pals now.
- l can't believe this. l'm so proud of you.

272
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,231
- This is a turning point.
- Yeah.

273
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,154
Maybe we've seen the last of that
Tasmanian devil of a waitress.

274
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,313
- Bring some more pretzels, too.
- All right, right away.

275
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,472
That's the woman
whose head you were about to shave.

276
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,397
l almost went through with it, too. l came
that close and l could have done it easy.

277
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,430
l mean, she's not as young
as she used to be. But l stopped.

278
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,637
God was testing me, Sam. And l passed.

279
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,397
- Hello there. Come on, it's your turn.
- Yeah, l'll be right with you.

280
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,998
l didn't say l got an ''A'', Sammy.
l just said l passed.

281
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,190
Rack them up.
