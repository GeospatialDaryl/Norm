     <i>a live studio audience.</i>

00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:07,688
    Congratulate the doctor.    

3
00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:10,025
    I'm doing a piece on the    
  psychological ramifications   

4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:13,194
of Ingmar Bergman's later works 
    for <i>American Film.</i>          

5
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,179
        Oh, that's great, Fras. 

6
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:15,597
I'd like to read it to you      

7
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:16,898
to see if it's still accessible 
to the layman.                  

8
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:18,633
    May I have your opinion?    

9
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:22,537
Sure. Buy a new suit,           
get a haircut and stay home.    

10
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:25,290
    Thank you, Carla.           

11
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,859
Now, I call the piece           

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,896
"Ingmar Bergman:                
Poet of the Subconscious."      

13
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,698
The films of Ingmar Bergman...  

14
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:35,867
         Who could forget her in
             <i>Casablanca,</i> huh?   

15
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:39,253
    No, no...                   

16
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:40,922
No, you're thinking             
of <i>Ingrid</i> Bergman.              

17
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:42,857
I'm talking                     
about <i>Ingmar</i> Bergman.           

18
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,059
Ingmar Bergman, the boxer?      

19
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:48,796
      No, Woody, you're thinking
            of Ingmar Johansson.

20
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,632
You mean the guy who            
knocked out Floyd Patterson?    

21
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,567
    No, no, no-- Sonny Liston   
    knocked out Patterson.      

22
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:54,669
Well, then who                  
knocked out Johansson?          

23
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:55,686
                      Patterson.

24
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:56,521
         Before Liston?         

25
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,206
              No, no, Johansson 
             knocked out Liston.

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,440
                 Who knocked out
                      Patterson?

27
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:00,458
     Was it <i>Ingrid</i> Bergman?     

28
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:05,180
No, <i>Ingrid</i> Bergman...           

29
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:06,148
Shut up! Shut up!               

30
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,284
Not one more word.              

31
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,519
I came in here                  
to discuss Ingmar Bergman,      

32
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:15,090
not start an Abbott             
and Costello routine.           

33
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:19,094
             Actually, I thought
         it was more like Martin
        and Lewis, wasn't it?   

34
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:21,396
You mean Joe Louis?             

35
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,466
                Oh, he's the one
                who knocked out 
                Floyd Patterson.

36
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,402
      Then who knocked out      
         Lou Costello?          

37
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:30,271
Apparently, Ingrid Bergman.     

38
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:37,745
      Boy, she was tougher      
        than she looked.        

39
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,735

00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:52,560
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

43
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,963
 Sure would help a lot         

44
00:01:55,997 --> 00:02:01,068
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

45
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:03,838
   Sometimes you want to go    

46
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:09,244
     Where everybody knows     
          your name            

47
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:13,781
 And they're always glad       
        you came               

48
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,084
         You want to be        
      where you can see

 You want to be where everybody
    knows your name

                        all day.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah, she must be really trying 
to impress a biggie.

            that in mind, Cliff,

It's not that easy, pal.

You got to take a test.

alert Sammy?

         Ah, he knows.

He can sense these things.      

75

     I'm going to give him,

    He's slowing down,          
     but he's still got it.

 Hey, give me a break, will ya?

try it someday.                 

124
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,707
         All right, for the sake
            of argument, I will.

125
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,941
        Yeah.                   

126
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,009
                All right, here.

127
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,849
                      Excuse me.
              Would you consider
              going out with me?

128
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,885
I really don't think so.        

129
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,852
                    Oh, yeah?   

130
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,554
        Well, what if I told you
        you could punch that guy

131
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,789
                     right there
                 in the stomach?

132
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,043
            ( <i>speaking quietly</i> )

133
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,146
     Oh, yeah, right, Sam--     
           <i>my</i> stomach.          

134
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,549
          What do you           
      think I am, stupid?       

135
00:05:55,654 --> 00:06:00,358
        Well, everyone,         
  you are looking at a winner.  

136
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,092
You were the best kisser-upper? 

137
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,445
      Gee, what does that       
    trophy look like?           

138
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,397
    I did not kiss up.          

139
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,832
      I gave an interview.      

140
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,000
I gave one hell of an interview.

141
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,872
 I was tough, I was insightful, 
          I was witty.          

142
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,774
Meryl Streep will play me       
         in the movie.          

143
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:18,676
     You know, I gave them      

144
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:20,628
    a million and one ideas     
    to promote Cheers.          

145
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,063
    My marketing major          
     really paid off today.     

146
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:28,018
 They couldn't take their eyes  
            off me.             

147
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,222
Were you writing something down 
before you went in there?       

148
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,441
Yes, I jotted down a few notes. 

149
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,144
 Were you using a fountain pen? 

150
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:39,096
     My lucky fountain pen.     

151
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:43,100
            Make that your      
            leaky fountain...   

152
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,936
              Oh.               

153
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,838
        I don't believe this!   

154
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,773
    And I thought they were     
    really impressed with me,   

155
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:49,908
      and they were just staring

156
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,910
                at this big, old
                stupid ink blot.

157
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,678
              It's not that bad,
              Miss Howe.        

158
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,246
    It's kind of decorative.    

159
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,248
  It looks like, uh, a bunny.   

160
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,085
                No, no, it looks
                 like a spider. 

161
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,587
Or a butterfly.                 

162
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,822
    It looks like my parents    
  having a screaming argument   

163
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:05,856
      on my third birthday      

164
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,675
        when I pretended        
    to be asleep but wasn't.    

165
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,500
        Or a butterfly.         

166
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,272
     Afternoon, everybody.      

167
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,525
        Yo-ho.                  
                        ALL:    
                        Norm!   

168
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,792
Beer, Norm?                     

169
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:25,910
Have I gotten that predictable? 

170
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,779
             Good.              

171
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:30,347
Hey, weren't you supposed to    
have a painting job today?      

172
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,983
                  You're right, 
                 Cliffie, I did,

173
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:33,301
            but I screwed it up.

174
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,653
    Turns out I was supposed    
     to show up yesterday.      

175
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:38,055
  So they went ahead and hired  
         somebody else.         

176
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:41,793
  Like they couldn't open the   
  restaurant a damn day later.  

177
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,260
Well, you know,                 
you might be                    

178
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,029
the world's greatest            
house painter--                 

179
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,697
although who would know         
the difference?                 

180
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,366
But, you know,                  
as a businessman,               

181
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,519
you really leave a lot          
to be desired, you know.        

182
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,488
You haven't had a job           
in three months.                

183
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:56,290
                Cliff, you're   
            absolutely right.   

184
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,142
I could do something about that.

185
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,244
Or I could sit right here       
and feel sorry for myself       

186
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,912
  and nurse this beer all day.  

187
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,698
 And since I'm already here...  

188
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,402
Wait a minute.                  

189
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:09,536
Here we have a man              

190
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:12,706
who doesn't know how            
to promote his business.        

191
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,176
And here we have a woman        
who knows everything            
about promotion,                

192
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,711
but has never really            
been given a chance.            

193
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,948
    Now, if I can turn          
     a beer-guzzling nobody     

194
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:23,167
into a successful               
businessman,                    

195
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,302
      then those guys down there
        at corporate will see   

196
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:26,503
         that I can do anything.

197
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,841
 Uh, much as I love your pitch, 
        Rebecca...              

198
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,376
    uh, I'm not comfortable     
     working with friends.      

199
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,660
Oh, forget about friends.       

200
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,379
In the cold light               
of reason,                      

201
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,964
         consider this:         

202
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,666
    Please, please, please,     
        for Becky?              

203
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,886
            Nah, nah, I'd rather
                 work by myself.

204
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,137
    Fine, Norm, fine.           

205
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:44,238
    I'll just go back           

206
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,023
to what I was doing--           

207
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,926
        going over these        
    delinquent bar accounts.    

208
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,763
             Whoa.              

209
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,286
 Now there's a rather huge one  
      in the "P" section.       

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,288
Welcome to Team Peterson.       

211
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,977
Nothing like bicycling          

212
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,946
to clean the garbage            
out of your system.             

213
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,648
Coffee, Woody.                  

214
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:11,849
                      How do you
                want it, Sam?   

215
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,785
Uh, straight,                   
no cream, no sugar.             

216
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,888
Oh, what the hell--             
forget the water,               

217
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,806
just give me                    
a handful of grounds.           

218
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,643
Hey, uh, Sammy,                 
the old Erin machine's          

219
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,144
really tuckering                
you out, huh?                   

220
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,780
No, no, I'm fine.               

221
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,481
I just need a little something  
to pick me up here.             

222
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,416
How about six pallbearers?      

223
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,136
You guys are just jealous       

224
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,639
    because I'm toning          
        and you're not.         

225
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,792
I am buff.                      

226
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,862
I mean I am discovering muscles 
I didn't even know I had.       

227
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:44,048
        Oh! There's one.        

228
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,449
        That feels good,        
    that feels good, though.    

229
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,051
Ah! All right,                  
I've got to go change.          

230
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,620
        I'm meeting Erin        
         to go jogging.         

231
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,255
What's wrong                    
with our lives?                 

232
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,794
        Yeah, we have lousy jobs
                  with poor pay,

233
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:59,480
      we both waste all our time
             sitting on our cans

234
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:02,466
         in this beer hall doing
         nothing but watching TV

235
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,618
              and gossiping like
         a couple of old ladies,

236
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:09,323
            plus everyone thinks
                  we're dufuses.

237
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,359
Geez, you know,                 
I was just going                

238
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,227
to say we could probably use    
a little bit more exercise,     

239
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:16,964
but, uh, I'll go along          
with what you said.             

240
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,370
Oh, Norm, there you are.        

241
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,405
            Oh, gee,            
    how'd you track me down?    

242
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:30,744
             I got some terrific
         ideas for 4-A Painting.

243
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:32,429
That's what you're going to call
    the company, huh?           

244
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,081
            Yeah, it's an old   
            marketing secret.   

245
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:36,918
          It puts our name first
          in the phone book.    

246
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:39,420
                    How come 4A?
                    Why not 3A? 

247
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:40,888
                  Because that's
                  the Auto Club.

248
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:43,574
     Wow, they got jumper cables
          and they paint houses?

249
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,942
                I've got to join
                      that club.

250
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:47,945
                  Woody, this is
             a business meeting.

251
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:51,699
            Sorry! Next time,   
            I'll wear a suit.   

252
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,604
            Anyway... all right.

253
00:10:56,638 --> 00:11:00,024
    All successful businesses   
        and products have logos.

254
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,758
             Now, I have come up

255
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,811
            with the perfect,   
                     delightful,

256
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:07,064
    charming little character   
      to symbolize 4-A Painting.

257
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:14,221
         It's a lizard.         

258
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,208
    No, it's Carl Chameleon.    

259
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,445
    Now, like all chameleons,   
    Carl changes colors.        

260
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,798
    And so should your house.   

261
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:28,685
When you think of color change  
think of Carl and 4-A Painting. 

262
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,007
 That sure makes my old symbol  
    seem like nothing.          

263
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,409
                What was your   
                    old symbol? 

264
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,212
    Nothing.                    

265
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:38,979
                All right, Norm,

266
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:39,864
      I gotta computerize       
         the accounts,          

267
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:40,765
      I've gotta get some       

268
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,699
      advertising set up,       

269
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,833
        and I gotta get a new   

270
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,968
        phone line installed.   

271
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,786
      Whoa, wait, how much      
is all this gonna cost me?      

272
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
            Minimal.            

273
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,922
 $2,000, $3,000 to begin with.  

274
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:53,010
     I'm beginning to think     
         AAAA Painting          

275
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,146
        is gonna cost me        
        a-a-a-a fortune.        

276
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,599
It's making you                 
stutter, too.                   

277
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,451
CLIFF:                          
Nah, nah,                       

278
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,120
      but, uh, seems like       
     Rebecca is costing you     

279
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,638
        more money              
     than she's making you.     

280
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,774
You thinking of giving her      
    the old pink slip?          

281
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,943
I couldn't do that, Cliff.      

282
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,077
FRASIER:                        
Well, you know, Norm,           

283
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,012
I think we all agree            
that letting somebody go        

284
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,514
      is the most painful,      
         difficult task         

285
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:14,715
    someone could undertake.    

286
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,450
    I'll do it.                 

287
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,954
 Carla, this is Norm's problem. 
    He has to do it himself.    

288
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:22,957
            You're absolutely   
                 right, Frasier,
                     and I will.

289
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,225
                 Carla, go fire 
                Rebecca, please.

290
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,796
    No, no, no, nope, Norm,     
 you've got to do it yourself.  

291
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,664
      You've got to do it       
          right away.           

292
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,233
     Otherwise, it'll just      
exacerbate the situation.       

293
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,001
You can do it, man.             

294
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,803
          Be dauntless          
        and implacable.         

295
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:36,503
          You're bad!           

296
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:37,972
            Yeah!               
Yeah!                           

297
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,740
                  Like I'm mean?

298
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:40,574
Yeah!                           
            Yeah!               

299

        Like I'm a mean machine?

300

                    Yeah!

Yeah!                           

301
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,697
                    Yeah! Yeah! 
That's it.                      

302
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,266
        All right!

          How'd it go?          

305
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:01,378
          Great. Uh...          

306
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,180
 we found a new voice for Carl.

                    Norm, that's
                    our phone.  

310

         That's the 4-A hotline.

    did your car break down?    

315

Well,                           
our tow truck                   

316
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:39,283
     should be there within     
the next, uh, 30 to 40 minutes. 

317

 Whatever you do, don't leave.

I think I'll cruise by on       
the way home and yell something.

319
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,680
             Somebody confused

                    that happen?

00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,304
Not if I leave this instant, no.

484
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,011
         You tell Japan         
I can play hardball, too.       

485
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,912
                     Just do it.

486
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:16,664
             Do it.             

487
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:17,715
              ( <i>phone hangs up</i> )

488
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,267
     Hey, that's my motto.      

489
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,985
            Now, Miss Harris,   

490
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,371
     I hear you're looking      
  for a job with the company.   

491
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,940
My name's Miss Howe and I       
 already work for the company.  

492
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,292
Then everything's settled,      
    show yourself out.          

493
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:32,096
          But-But-But-          
  But I had something to say.   

494
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,980
         Make it quick.         

495
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,965
Mr. Anawalt, I have worked      

496
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,601
for this company                
for six years now.              

497
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:39,436
    For four of those,          
     I didn't get a raise.      

498
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,371
  Now not less than 36 people   
         have passed me         

499
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,774
    on the corporate ladder.    
    ( <i>mechanical whirring</i> )     

500
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,342
Oh, my God.                     

501
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,444
                    What's that?

502
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:49,913
        Evidently,              
 an out-of-work window washer.  

503
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,708
         Well, you have         
to admire his initiative.       

504
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:03,943
So, you've worked here six years

505
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:06,363
        and you've              
  been treated like hell. Hmm.  

506
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:10,200
         But I've never         
    been happier in my life.    

507
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,386
And I'd never                   
want anything                   

508
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,604
        to change.              

509
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,373
    Thank you for letting me    
     get that off my chest.     

510
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,060
            Damn it.            

511
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:24,030
         I'm doing it.          

512
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:28,736
Mr. Anawalt, I have something   
else to say, and this is it.    

513
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,088
    You wouldn't know a good    
      marketing executive       

514
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:34,024
         if one came up         
    and bit you on the butt.    

515
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,943
  Now I am better and smarter   

516
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:39,045
     than 50% of the people     
        that work here,         

517
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,332
 and if you can't see that then 
  you are blind or a buffoon.   

518
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:44,801
        Take your pick.         

519
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,220
    Now if you'll excuse me,    

520
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,789
  I have to get back to Cheers  

521
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,557
        where I am sure         
all my personal belongings      

522
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:54,628
     will be waiting for me     
 in a Hefty bag on the street.  

523
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:55,195
        Miss Howe.              

524
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:57,747
     What do you want now?      

525
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,883
    You have a lot of nerve     
    talking to me like that.    

526
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:02,986
This company was built on nerve.

527
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,754
    Not enough young people     
         have the guts          

528
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:07,524
        to stand up and say what
        they're really thinking.

529
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,093
I've been looking for that      
    brave child who wouldn't    

530
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:13,897
    be afraid to say,           
 "The emperor has no clothes."  

531
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,649
        He's nude, sir.         

532
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,688
          Buck naked.           

533
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:24,408
You think you could handle      
a triple-raise in salary?       

534
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:25,809
         Oh, yes, sir.          

535
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,144
                You think       
                you could handle

536
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,012
         an executive position  
         with my marketing team?

537
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,346
    Yes, sir.                   

538
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,614
                 Think you could
                 start Monday?  

539
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:32,716
        Yes, sir.               

540
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,950
                 Welcome aboard.

541
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,569
         Oh, yes, sir.          

542
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:40,307
          Sir, th-this          
  is a dream come true for me.  

543
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,758
      ( <i>knocking at door</i> )      
              Yes?              

544
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,460
                FBI.            

545
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:46,530
            Mr. Anawalt,        
            you're under arrest.

546
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:47,531
              What's the charge?

547
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:48,698
          Insider trading.      

548
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:49,999
              Come on, let's go.
              Take him downtown.

549
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,168
    No!                         
                    Read him    
                    his rights. 

550
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:52,902
You have the right              
to remain silent.               
                Get those files.

551
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:54,571
Anything you say                
can and will...                 
    You can't do this.          

552
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,938
     This man is innocent.      

553
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,375
No, they have me dead to rights.

554
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,911
              Oh... Mr. Anawalt.

555
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:02,345
                    Mr. Anawalt.

556
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,814
         I'll wait for you, sir.

557
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:07,383
          I'll be standing right
          here, waiting for you.

558

      ( <i>thunder crashes</i> )       

559
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:15,224
  I think I am the unluckiest
