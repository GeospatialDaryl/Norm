00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:08,856
Thanks. Say,                    
aren't you Sam Malone?

4
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:10,358
Guilty as charged.

Small world.                    
Marge Thornhill here.

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:14,996
Don't you remember me?

7
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:17,715
Ah, boy, you know,          
 I can't quite place the face.

8
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:19,483
Where'd we meet?

9
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,270
Well, we didn't actually meet, 
 but I know you'll remember me.

10
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:25,407
I went to every home game       
        you ever played.

11
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,509
Uh... Marge,

12
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:30,311
there are a lot of people       
    up in the stands there.

13
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,163
Sure, but you got           
        to remember me.

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,198
I always sat          
    right behind first base,

15
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,167
five rows up, remember?

16
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:37,719
I used to get there,

17
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:40,255
early so I could watch you      
    warm up in the bullpen.

18
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:42,990
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:45,793
I know,             
you couldn't forget this.

20
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:49,480
Hey, Malone!          
You pitch like my sister!

21
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:52,934
Why don't you go home      
    and make a dress!

22
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,038
Was that you?

23
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:57,973
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,358
Well, how have you been?

25
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,509
Guys, I want you to...

26
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,611
Do the one where you say    
    I couldn't get the ball

27
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,746
across the plate        
 if I drove it there in my car.

28
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:08,616
No, no, that was then,     
        and this is now.

29
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:10,385
By the way, I'm really sorry

30
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,787
for all those shots       
I gave you over the years.

31
00:01:12,854 --> 00:01:14,122
No hard feelings?

32
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,724
No, of course not.          
It's all part of the game.

33
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,760
You're a real sport, Malone.

34
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,462
( <i>laughs</i> )

35
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,665
You call this a martini?!

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,319
What'd you use for vermouth,  
          turpentine?!

37
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:32,173
The great ones never lose it.

All right, I got it,    
                 I got it.

47
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,737
The worst possible      
              way to die?       
                         Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,439

No. I think I can do
             better than that.

50
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,660
I'd say the worst way to die

51
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,530
is to be sliding down      
    a razor banister, okay?

52
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:30,264
A <i>greased</i> razor banister.

FRASIER:            
    Wait, I've got it.

54
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,002
To die alone,

knowing that you        
     have never been loved.

56

Come on, Frasier, if you're not 
even gonna try... Come on.

57
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,979
Ooh, Carla, what are you
             all decked out for?

58
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,614
It's my second                  
wedding anniversary.

59
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,983
Oh. Things are 
                 going okay with
                 you and Eddie?

60
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,251
I mean,

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,953
just last week,         
      you were calling him

62
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,588
a "dent-nosed, toothless    
         little frog."

63
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:55,623
Pillow talk.

64
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,058
Ah.

65
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:59,026
Well, actually,         
I was a little upset there

66
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,029
about the fact that he's been  
 on the road with the ice show

67
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,165
for a month now,        
      and I haven't gotten

68
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,700
so much as a phone call.

69
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:08,136
But this morning, I suddenly  
  realized what he was doing.

70
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:09,471
Treating you like crap?

71
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:13,641
No. No, that's what       
     he wants me to think.

72
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,610
It's way of setting up     
          a surprise.

73
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:17,878
So you figure he's              
been neglecting you             
just to set you up.

74
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,864
It's got to be that--      
        I know this man.

75
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,298
Woody, what time is it?

76
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,568
Oh, don't go by <i>my</i> watch--
                 I always set it

77
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,803
ten minutes ahead so I
    won't be late for things.

78
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,705
You were late this morning.

79
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,941
Yeah, I know.          
I couldn't find my watch.

80
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,927
It's, uh, 6:30, Carla.

81
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,280
Well, he's still got
            five and a half more
            hours till midnight.

82
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,382
Yeah, he's really   
            cutting it close.

83
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,085
But it'll make it   
                all the sweeter 
            when it happens.

84
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:44,321
Yeah, anniversaries
             can be just great.

85
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,607
I'll never forget           
my first anniversary with Vera.

86
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,110
Yeah, we, uh...

87
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:51,579
Oh, my God, I did forget it.

88
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:55,350
Anybody know where I can get  
  a 17-year-old box of candy?

89
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:58,386
Frasier, my fawn,           
    I deserve a treat.

90
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,023

from an innie to an outie.

Well, this <i>is</i> news.

00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,426
LILITH:                         
Uh, Norm? We have

93
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,196
a few things we'd like          
to ask you about.               
              Oh, great. Must be

94
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,882
pretty important if you're      
willing to buy me a free drink.

95
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,233
Oh, of course we will.

96
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,468
A drink for Norm? 
              What do you drink?

97
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,005

( <i>chuckling</i> )

99
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,141
What's so funny?

100
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,442
It's just that everyone knows

101
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,177
Norm always drinks beer,        
dearest.

102
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:25,212
Ah. That <i>is</i> hysterical.

103
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,315
Anyway, Lilith and I

104
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:30,384
have been talking,          
    and we have decided that

105
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,520
we would like you to decorate  
    our unborn child's room.

106
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,388
All right!              
      Sure, I can do that.

107
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,257
I just did a nursery       
     for my sister-in-law.

108
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,625
I went with

109
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,243
Gummy Bears rampant       
     in a field of Smurfs.

110
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,745
Oh, no, no, no.

111
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,281
We'd like to stay away from that
cutesie-ootsie drivel that

112
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,668
retards the child's creative   
 and intellectual development.

113
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:51,072
All right, uh, do we know if  
 it's gonna be a boy or a girl?

114
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,008
We are not going to cram sexual 
identity down our baby's throat.

115
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,677
So, naturally,

116
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:58,212
the room should be,       
     oh, sexually neutral.

117
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,848
Good. Fine, I can do that.

118
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,649
When I'm finished,        
      your kid won't have

119
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,251
a clue what sex it is.

120
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:06,888
Hey, everybody, listen up.

121
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:09,491
We only got a few minutes       
    to the game here.

122
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,325
Who wants in          
    on the basketball pool?

123
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,661
OTHERS:             
I'm in! Put me down! Yeah!

124
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,196
There you go, gentlemen.

125
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,164
Woody, how about you?

126
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:19,751
Oh, I don't know, Sam, I don't 
 like playing games for money.

127
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:23,354
You end up either losing money  
or taking it from your friends.

128
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:25,406
No, no, Woody,         
this is just a game, man.

129
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,907
You know, five bucks a square.

130
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,910
You got four quarters,     
      four chances to win.

131
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:32,913
I don't know, I don't like      
 taking money from my friends.

132
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:37,218
Aw, go ahead, Woody-- 
        nobody here gives a     
          hoot about you anyway.

133
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:40,371
Okay, great.

134
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,474
It's just money.

135
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,910
This isn't
                gambling, is it?
        Gambling?

136
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,979
Sam, we have had    
            this talk before.

137
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,747
I can get   
                  closed down.

138
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,983
This? Oh, no, no.           
            Thanks.

139
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,685
This is not gambling,      
         this is, uh...

140
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:55,887
well, this is a game.

141
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,822
Uh, haven't you ever heard      
            of, uh,

142
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,456
Championship Tic-tac-toe?

143
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,309
It's a game.

144
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:02,643
Uh, who's next here?       
                         Me. Me.

145
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,012
All righty.           
                It's my turn.

146
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,665
And I will take 
            this square here.

147
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,467
And, uh... Oh,

Oh, Sammy, by the way,          
this, uh,

153
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,151

 How stupid do you think I am?

                  the big deal?

158

It's just a friendly

It's a simple $500 pot.

          something for nothing?

    it takes me to earn $500?

Well, two can play
        at the surprise game.

Your beard might be phony,

about you that's real.

    flew in to surprise you?

00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:47,398
It was hardly a surprise;       
we booked those reservations    
three weeks in advance.

179
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:51,536
So you were in on

00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,784
Me, I'm going home.

436
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:51,321
I'm going to go sit in     
 a dark room and have some fun.

437
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:53,824
( <i>phone ringing</i> )           
        Putting on              
    a Gene Pitney record...

438
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:55,525
WOODY: 
                         Cheers.

439
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:56,960
and I'm gonna slice Eddie's face

440
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,329
out of every picture      
         in the house.

441
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:00,681
Oh, hey, how you doing?

442
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:03,183
No, I don't think she can come 
      to the phone, Eddie.

443
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,484
She has plans  
                for the evening.

444
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:07,020
Give me that phone!

445
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,489
Is this really Eddie?

446
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,124
Well, sure it's me, babe.

447
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,176
Listen, honey, I'm sorry    
     I couldn't come home.

448
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:16,446
I mean, I wanted to make last  
 year's celebration look sick.

449
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:17,797
I already got my plane ticket,

450
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,333
I'm at the airport,       
        and everything,

451
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,901
and they called me back     
         to rehearsal.

452
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,536
They changed the whole script  
        of the ice show.

453
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:26,156
They've taken all the humanity 
    out of the big bad wolf,

454
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:30,093
and the three little pigs think 
they're God's gift to ice.

455
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:32,162
I really don't want       
    to talk about it.

456
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:35,598
Hey, Eddie,           
 when am I gonna see you again?

457
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,467
Gee, I guess          
     in a couple of months.

458
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,770
A couple of months?

459
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,905
Listen, honey, I got to go.

460
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,907
The bus is about to leave       
          from Yakima,

461
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,442
and if I don't make it quick,

462
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,811
the pigs will grab        
      all the good seats.

463
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,730
Hey, Eddie, I love you.

464
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,832
I love you too, sweetie. Bye.

465
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:56,369
( <i>phone click and dial tone</i> )

466
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:59,072
Hey, everybody,                 
listen up.

467
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,558
I want you all         
      to repeat after me.

468
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,695
I am a very stupid person.

469
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,881
ALL:              
  "I am a very stupid person."

470
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:11,551
And I will never doubt     
        the undying love

471
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:15,956
and total commitment that       
  exists, always has existed,

472
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:20,760
and always will exist      
 between Carla and Eddie LeBec.

473
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:24,764
ALL:              
  "I'm a very stupid person."

474
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,400
Close enough!

475
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:30,637
Well, turns out the only reason 
     he didn't surprise me

476
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:31,905
was he had to rehearse.

477
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:35,242
That ought to show you mo-mos  
        a lesson.

478
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,729
Well, that was Eddie            
on the phone.

479
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:39,996
Hey.

480
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:42,232
Isn't that just the nicest,     
sweetest thing

481
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,767
for Eddie to remember?

482
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,369
Yeah, Carla, sure was.

483
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:47,905
Yeah.

484
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,661
You called and reminded him,  
     didn't you, rat lips?

485
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,564
How could I?

486
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,733
I don't even know where he is.

487
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,301
Sammy, I'm going                
to ask you again,

488
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:02,402
and I'm warning you.

489
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,736
Hey, don't back up.

490
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:05,438
I'm not going to hurt you,      
you wimp.

491
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:07,174
All right.

492
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:11,744
The women in my family,     
        for generations,

493
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:15,848
have had absolutely no talents 
    or gifts but one.

494
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:20,153
We can make up any curse    
    and make it stick,

495
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,655
okay?

496
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:23,723
Now, tell me the truth,

497
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,226
or my curse on you          
         is gonna be...

498
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,662
Let me think of a good one here.

499
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,498
No, not the hair;   
          anything but the hair.

500
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay, okay.

501
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,604
Your eyes...

502
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:38,705
Oh, no, wait a minute.

503
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,607
I got it.

504
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,509
Your tongue

505
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:43,843
is gonna swell up

506
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:45,445
so big,

507
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:48,515
you're going to have to buy   
  a seat on the plane for it.

508
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,083
Carla, this     
                  is ridiculous.

509
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,485
Sammy, you know I can do it.

510
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:55,722
Now, look into my eyes     
     and tell me the truth.

511
00:22:57,258 --> 00:23:01,411
Did you call Eddie and remind  
him about our anniversary?

512
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,647
No, Carla, I didn't.

513
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,785
Okay.

514
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:11,722
But you and your tongue         
better be telling the truth.

515
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,431
Family curse.

516
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,317
( <i>slurring</i> ):          
          How gullible          
     does thee think I am?

517
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:31,607
Oh, no.

518
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:33,977
No, oh... Carla! Carla!

519
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,445
CARLA:                          
What?

520
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:38,014
Nothing.
