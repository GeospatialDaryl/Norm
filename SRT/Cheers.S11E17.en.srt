ANNOUNCER:
Last week on Cheers:

2
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:15,196
Oh, Frasier, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,797
I must have fallen asleep.

4
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:17,898
What time is it?

5
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,167
Well, it's pretty late.

6
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:21,336
Uh, I guess I...
I'll go downstairs

7
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:23,571
and, uh, sleep on the couch.

8
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,106
Maybe I should just go.

9
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:27,475
No, no, you don't
have to go home.

10
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:30,245
You don't have to
sleep on the couch.

11
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,715
Just a second.

12
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:42,807
(door opening and closing)

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,676
Frasier, what was that?

14
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:46,611
What was what?

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,580
I thought I heard a door slam.

16
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,648
You don't think those
guys are back, do you?

17
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,750
No. No, impossible.
I locked and dead-bolted it.

18
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,387
They'd need a key to get in.

19
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,739
Now, where were we?

20
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,929
Let's make this a night
we'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:16,907
Frasier.

22
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,160
Lilith?

23
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,998
Rebecca?!

24
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:30,839
Am I the only one
who feels awkward here?

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,906
Where is Frederick?

26
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:33,375
I didn't see him in his room.

27
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,309
He's with your mother.

28
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:38,688
Fine. Then I'll just go and let you
do whatever it was you were doing.

29
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,149
Lilith!

30
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,620
Lilith!

31
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,859
It was nice to see
you again, Lilith.

32
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:55,947
(theme song begins)

33
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:00,001
♪ Sometimes you want to go ♪

34
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,404

00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:10,011

♪ You wanna go where
everybody knows your name. ♪

39
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,193
All right, exactly how
long has this been going on?!

40
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,995
Lilith?

41
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,447
What's the matter, Sam?

42
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,248
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

43
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,800
Oh, I'm sorry.
You did.

44
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,206
Lilith, I-I-I thought
you were in that, uh...

45
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:56,574
I've left the Eco-pod.

46
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:59,277
For a job at a gas station?

47
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:02,647
Look... everybody,
Lilith!

48
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,048
Well, my goodness...

49
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,984
uh, the-the, you know,
the time in the pod thing

50
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,886
has really done you
a world of...

51
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,221
You look so...

52
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,407
Your skin is, uh...

53
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:16,261
Hey, Lilith's back, huh?

54
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,130
Sam, please!

55
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,932
Tell me what's been going on!

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,133
How long has Frasier

57
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,768
been sleeping with Rebecca?

58
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:26,054
Beg your pardon?

59
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:30,391
Did he at least have the courtesy
to wait until I was in the ground?

60
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,130
Lil... Lil...

61
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:38,499
Frasier's not sleeping
with Rebecca!

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,635
Oh, well, perhaps you
should tell them that.

63
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,870
I just saw them in
my bed together.

64
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,555
Rebecca and Frasier-
you're kidding me.

65
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,186
How long has this
been going on?

66
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,792
I'm asking you!

67
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:53,280
I can't believe...

68
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,717
We... we were just over there!

69
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,452
We, we were watching
Three Stooges tapes with him.

70
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,121
NORM:
Well, maybe she was upstairs

71
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:02,023
the whole time and
we didn't know about it.

72
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,191
Well, yeah, after we left,

73
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,193
maybe he just toddled on
upstairs

74
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,131
and gave her the old
nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

75
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,214
Rebecca and Frasier...

76
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:13,172
Am I to understand this is a
relatively new development?

77
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:16,837
Big news to us.
CLIFF: Who would have thought it?

78
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:18,623
Rebecca and Frasier, huh?

79
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,659
What's next, me and Carla?

80
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:23,961
(grunts)

81
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,433
Don't say it, Clavin,
don't you even think it.

82
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,100
See that?

83
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,769
It almost turned into a kiss.

84
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:36,023
You know what?
I think this is good for them.

85
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:37,925
They've been moping around
the last couple of months,

86
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:39,560
mooning about their
love life and everything.

87
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,862
They found each other.

88
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,213
This is very nice, I think.

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,330
Yeah.

90
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,249
Well, hear-hear!

91
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,551
To Rebecca and Frasier!

92
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,652
(all agreeing)

93
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,153
LILITH:
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

94
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:51,089
I'm still in the room!

95
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,191
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, Lilith.

96
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:55,060
I can't believe
this has happened.

97
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,195
I come home to resume my life

98
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,431
and find that my husband
has taken up with another woman.

99
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:03,150
Well, why don't you... why
don't you take your coat off,

100
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,653
sit down and just
cool out for a while?

101
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,922
Oh, I can't, Sam-
I'm too wound up.

102
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:10,257
I've got half a mind
to go back to that bedroom

103
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:11,993
and wring Frasier's neck.

104
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,251
Frasier's...? Aren't you being a
little out of line here, Lilith?

105
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:16,981
I mean, the guy's
only being human.

106
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:20,385
You were the one who walked
out of here with another man.

107
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,453
Oh, God, you're right.

108
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,456
It's just that
I wanted to come back so badly

109
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,458
and resume my life.

110
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,143
As naive and selfish

111
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,897
as it sounds, I just assumed
he would be waiting for me.

112
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,566
Listen, go get some sleep.

113
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,268
I'll bet you in the morning

114
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,671
you and Frasier
can work things out.

115
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,540
That's a good
idea, Sam. Yeah.

116
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,809
Where am I gonna sleep?

117
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,677
I wanted to stay at home,

118
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,213
and now I've got
no place to go.

119
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,016
I've got an attic
you can hang upside down in.

120
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,486
(taps bar)

121
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,797
Sam, if you could lend me
a little money for a hotel,

122
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:09,267
I'd really appreciate it.
No problem, no problem.

123
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,468
Thank you.

124
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,203
You know, I'll be right back.

125
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,573
I'm going to call my mother
and check up on Frederick.

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,575
You know, I have to say that

127
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,310
after being
cooped up underground

128
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:22,880
for the last six months, it's
very nice to see people again.

129
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,417
Even you people.

130
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,454
That was sweet.

131
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,440
Can you believe this stuff?

132
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:35,009
Yeah, I'd like to see the
look on Frasier's face

133
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:37,011
when Lilith walked in.

134
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,746
I'm sure he was shocked.

135
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,498
I mean, what
would you do, Norm,

136
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,401
if you walked in and found
Vera with another man?

137
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,586
Well, I'd probably buy
a couple of his pencils

138
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:47,588
and send him on his way.

139
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,343
Frederick is fine.

140
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,011
I worry, though, sometimes

141
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,081
that my mother may be too
overprotective and smothering.

142
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,301
You got to watch that-
that'll really screw a kid up.

143
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,905
Here's your money.

144
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,473
Thank you, Sam.

145
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,876
So, that, uh...

146
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:11,145
pod thing didn't work out, huh?

147
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,681
Suffice it to say
that Dr. Pascal and I

148
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:15,283
determined that two human beings

149
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,285
cannot live together
underground.

150
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,070
You and I could, Norm.

151
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,575
Would you stop
saying that, Cliff?

152
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,879
Lilith. Here you are.

153
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,630
I've been looking
all over for you.

154
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,582
What in the world
are you doing here?

155
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,017
I've come home, Frasier.

156
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,902
Oh, my God.

157
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,204
I've left the pod, and I
spent the last three days

158
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,806
on a bus to come home to you.

159
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:41,142
I don't understand.
Frasier,

160
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,378
I realize that my leaving
you was very hurtful,

161
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:46,447
and I understand
your seeking comfort

162
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,616
in the arms of another woman.

163
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:50,217
We won't mention it.

164
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:54,956
We'll just put it behind us
and-and get on with our lives.

165
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:57,357
What I'm trying to
say, Frasier, is...

166
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:58,442
You want me back?

167
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:00,278
Oh, yes, I want you back!

168
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,445
You hear that, everybody?

169
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,281
Frasier and Lilith
are back together again!

170
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,849
Aw, it makes me so happy!

171
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,551
Here, free drinks on the house!
All right!

172
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,870
Just a minute, Sam-
I haven't taken her back.

173
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:12,106
Oh, sorry, Mr. Peterson.

174
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:18,079
Wait, wait, come on, now.

175
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,348
Now, you two kids
belong together.

176
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:21,715
Come on.

177
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,234
The unmitigated gall!

178
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,570
You think you can walk back into
my life and patch it up again

179
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,638
as quickly as
you destroyed it?! Frasier, I'm sorry.

180
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,406
All right, she's sorry-
beers for everybody!

181
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,841
Come on.

182
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:31,959
Frasier, please.

183
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,628
More than anything,
I want our life back.

184
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:37,064
What about your
boyfriend, Dr. Pascal?

185
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,566
I don't love him.
I love you.

186
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,052
(chuckling):
Oh, really?

187
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,654
So you've come back
to reliable old Frasier, have you?

188
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:44,722
And for how long?

189
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,840
Till somebody opens
a colony on Venus?!

190
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,959
Frasier, don't be ridiculous.

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,162
If we go to Venus, I think
we should do it as a family.

192
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:56,568
(panting):
Lilith, I have to talk to you in private.

193
00:08:56,635 --> 00:09:00,555
(others hooting)

194
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,673
Okay, it doesn't
have to be in private.

195
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,409
Lilith, listen,
please let me explain.

196
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,877
Rebecca, you don't have to
explain anything to her.

197
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,880
You and I can pick up
right where we left off.

198
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,732
Really?
Absolutely!

199
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,568
Come on over here
and give me a big wet one.

200
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:16,037
Frasier, let me just

201
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,874
speak to you in
my office, please. Oh, okay, even better.

202
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,908
Heh! Sam, hold
my calls, will you?

203
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,459
Sofa pulls out, you know.

204
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,330
Sorry things aren't working out.

205
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,899
Is there anything
I can do for you?

206
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,636
It isn't over, yet, Sam.

207
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,004
I know my Frasier.

208
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,172
He doesn't take well
to sudden developments,

209
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,473
but he'll come around.

210
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,742
I'm as determined
to get him back

211
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,845
as I was to leave him.

212
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,396
Well, that's...

213
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:45,166
that's good, that's good.

214
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,934
Frasier, um...

215
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:50,671
listen, I know that Lilith
coming back changes everything,

216
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:54,008
and... so I'm just gonna
step out of the picture

217
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,577
and... and there's
no hard feelings.

218
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:59,413
That bitch!

219
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:01,349
Thinks she can waltz
back into my life

220
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,767
and start calling the shots?

221
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,805
I know that what we almost had
was very special, but...

222
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,607
we have a very
special friendship, too,

223
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,510
so I think that we should
just leave it at that.

224
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,428
Eco-pod my big white butt!

225
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,931
I was that close to popping her,
you know that?

226
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:20,134
If she weren't the mother
of my child, I'd have done it!

227
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,652
I-I think we should
just focus here,

228
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,055
because, y-you know, Frasier,
I'm trying to be very gentle,

229
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,890
because I want
to let you down easy.

230
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,758
I don't want
to break your heart.

231
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,996
"I spent three days on a bus,"
wah, wah, wah.

232
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,864
Well, cry me a river, bun-head!

233
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,066
For God's sake, Frasier,
will you listen to me!

234
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,667
I'm trying
to tell you something!

235
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,336
Oh. I'm sorry, Rebecca.

236
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,205
I've been rude; I apologize.

237
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:44,008
It's just, I can't believe
that she's come back.

238
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,177
Frasier...

239
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,546
you know, what we almost did,

240
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,382
I think it would
have been real special,

241
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,150
but...

242
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:56,970
I think maybe it's better that
we just remain good friends.

243
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,958
I suppose you're right.

244
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,627
Well, what might
have been, huh?

245
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,464
For what it's worth,

246
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,633
I'm sorry things
didn't work out.

247
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,435
(knocking)

248
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,270
Hi. Can I talk
to Rebecca alone, please?

249
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,271
Bar business.

250
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,706
Sure, Sam.

251
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:18,075
Oh, God, Sam,

252
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,678
why do I always screw
everything up?!

253
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,247
All I was doing was giving
a friend a ride home.

254
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,048
And then you know
how things happen.

255
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,751
You know, a kiss leads to a hug

256
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,018
and a hug leads to the bed,

257
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,319
and then the wife comes in

258
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,939
and wants to know
what you're doing there.

259
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:38,595
Why do I always make
such a mess of things?!

260
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,383
So who was better,
me or Frasier?

261
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,567
Oh!

262
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,436
What?

263
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:49,106
I-I don't have feelings, too?!

264
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:52,076
Frasier, I know that
I've hurt you,

265
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:53,844
and I realize now
that the only way

266
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,846
to get you back is to beg.

267
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:56,997
So here I go.

268
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,115
I'm sorry, Lilith.

269
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,550
Begging won't work.

270
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,719
I'm not gonna hang around
and be the safety net

271
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,989
every time you fall from one
of your flights of fancy.

272
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,024
That boat has sailed.

273
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,227
That gate has closed.

274
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:12,096
Alice doesn't live
here anymore.

275
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,501
Damn you, Frasier!

276
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,369
I know that somewhere
inside of you,

277
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,937
you still have deep feelings
for me,

278
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,038
and I'm willing to wait.

279
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,673
If I have to wait
a hundred years,

280
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,004
I'm going to get you back!

281
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,392
You hear that, guys?

282
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,461
Come on, free beer, let's go.

283
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,897
Aw, Lilith.

284
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:31,132
Louis!

285
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,000
Pascal! What are
you doing here?

286
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,201
Try to stop me, Crane.

287
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,203
I've come to take Lilith
back to our home

288
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:37,471
under the dirt,
where we're safe.

289
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:40,123
Louis, I'm not
going back there.

290
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:42,726
How can you abandon the oneness
of our subterranean life

291
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,362
for this world of surfies?

292
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,681
Surface dwellers.

293
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,467
Because this

294
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,801
is where I want to be.

295
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,759
Our experiment failed, Louis,
and so did our love affair.

296
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,139
I'm not leaving without you,
Lilith.

297
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,974
I demand that you accompany me
this instant.

298
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,608
And if I don't?

299
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,394
Then I'll be forced
to shoot you

300
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:02,796
a-a-and everyone else
in this bar.

301
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,616
What's it gonna be?

302
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,318
Louis, I'm not going
back with you.

303
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,887
So I guess you're just going
to have to shoot us.

304
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,028
Welcome back, Lilith.

305
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,989
I'm warning you,
unless Lilith agrees to go back with me,

306
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,624
you're all dead.

307
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,492
You don't scare me, Pascal.

308
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,894
Yeah? Why not?

309
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,730
Because I happen
to own every copy

310
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,799
of Soldier of Fortune
ever published.

311
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:42,403
I'm telling you people,
no "ifs" "ands" or "buts",

312
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,639
that there's no working pistol
with that configuration.

313
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,858
(gunshot) (shrieks)

314
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,478
I did miss the Christmas issue.

315
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,765
All right, get back, get back!

316
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:56,333
Don't push me.

317
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,101
The importance of the Eco-pod

318
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,437
is far greater
than any one human life.

319
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,606
Sam...

320
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,828
John, John,
it's not a good time.

321
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,781
Sam, I've put up with your rock
and roll music,

322
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,550
your loud parties
and your fights.

323
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:16,753
But now you've shot Ruben
the busboy in the foot.

324
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:21,208
He's an undocumented alien
without health insurance,

325
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,677
and that puts me
in a bit of a jam.

326
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,864
Oh...

327
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:28,699
A bigger jam.

328
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,885
Everybody but Lilith
behind the bar!

329
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,973
(phone rings)

330
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,610
All right, answer the phone,
but act natural.

331
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,582
Cheers.

332
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,351
Just a second.

333
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,688
Mr. Peterson,
it's Mrs. Peterson.

334
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,590
See, it's my wife.

335
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:55,392
Um, I'll get rid of her.

336
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,960
(quietly):
Woody, cover me.

337
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,796
Uh, Vera?

338
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,399
Uh, yes, yes, I know it's late.

339
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,901
You see, we're
being held hostage by a mad gunman, and...

340
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:08,339
What do you mean I've
used that one before?

341
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,858
No-no-no, you see, no-no, honey,
wait, wait, hey, hey!

342
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:14,561
(receiver clicks)

343
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,873
Put the gun down, Louis.

344
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,132
Why are you being so foolish?

345
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,067
Because I can't live
without you!

346
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,835
I miss you.

347
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:23,471
And Dr. Jaworski
misses you, too.

348
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,406
FRASIER:
Dr. Jaworski?!

349
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,992
What? There were three
scientists in the Eco-pod?

350
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,626
Did you sleep with him, too?!

351
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,279
Dr. Jaworski
isn't a scientist.

352
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:36,283
He's Loui' imaginary friend.

353
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,288
Did I forget to mention
that Louis is insane?

354
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,324
Turns out he's claustrophobic.

355
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,492
We discovered that
little fact about 30 seconds

356
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:49,162
after they closed
the steel doors.

357
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,414
(knocking)

358
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,450
PAUL: Hey, guys, I know you're
having a party in there.

359
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,167
Let me in.

360
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:55,453
Who's that at the hatch?

361
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,254
That's nobody,
nobody important.

362
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,955
We'll see about that.

363
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,658
So what's the big secret?

364
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:02,993
What's going on?

365
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,878
Paul, we're being held hostage!

366
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,580
Fine, then don't tell me.

367
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:09,316
Get with the others.

368
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:12,578
Actually, I don't belong
with the others.

369
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,638
I, I never quite fit in.
Ask anyone.

370
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,772
No, he doesn't.

371
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:16,974
PASCAL:
Shut up! Shut up!

372
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,643
Get behind the bar!
Go on.

373
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,279
All right, Lilith,

374
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,348
if you want to play
the waiting game,

375
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,150
I'm prepared to play along.

376
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,120
I give you just ten minutes
to make up your mind.

377
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:35,008
If you won't leave with me then,
I start shooting.

378
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,595
And this is the man
you wanted to marry?!

379
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,163
Who says I wanted to marry him?

380
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,300
Two days ago, I got a Mail-gram
saying you wanted a divorce.

381
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,952
Correction, I sent
that Mail-gram.

382
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,354
I thought that with you out
of the way,

383
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,682
Lilith and I would be free

384
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:50,508
to spend the rest
of our lives together.

385
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,275
But then Lilith escaped.

386
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,477
By the way, it was very clever
of you

387
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:57,580
putting that papier-mâché bust
of yourself in your cot.

388
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,350
I must admit,

389
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:02,619
I kissed it more than once
before I got wise.

390
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,341
You have nine minutes left.

391
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,276
(whispers):
Hey, I got a plan. Come here.

392
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:12,696
Lilith, Lilith, here's the plan.

393
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:15,483
Okay, you go back
to the Eco-pod with Pascal.

394
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:16,900
And then what?

395
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,802
And then the plan's done.

396
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:23,006
Don't panic.
I know Louis.

397
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:26,009
He's a little upset right now,
but he's essentially harmless.

398
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,213
He won't do anything that would
cause anyone any harm.

399
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,614
The hell I won't!

400
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,950
I'll shoot everyone in this bar
if I have to to get you back!

401
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,020
CLIFF:
Listen, okay, okay.

402
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,056
All right, all right, I got it.

403
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,376
How about I sob uncontrollably

404
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:45,679
and-and lose control
of my bodily functions?

405
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,898
Cliff, is that a plan?

406
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,633
No, actually,
it's more of a warning.

407
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,891
No, no, no, I,
I've got one. Come here.

408
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,360
I'll go up there
and I'll come on to him.

409
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:03,396
I'll flirt with him,
and I'll distract him.

410
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:07,233
Any other thoughts?

411
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:09,736
Anyone?

412
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,822
You're a psychiatrist.

413
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,191
Talk to the man.

414
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,427
You must be trained in
some kind of technique.

415
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,929
I was afraid somebody
would bring that up.

416
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,197
All right, all right.

417
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,567
I do recall taking
some sort of an oath once.

418
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,369
Good luck. Good luck.

419
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:30,407
Keep your distance, Crane!

420
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:32,125
Okay.

421
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:34,094
I, I just want to
talk to you, Louis.

422
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:36,763
Do you mind if
I call you "Louis"?

423
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,550
Listen, Louis,
I, I've been there.

424
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,902
I've felt the hurt.

425
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,820
I've felt the abandonment.

426
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:46,022
I've felt what it's like

427
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,259
when a woman tears
your entire life apart.

428
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,129
Believe me,
I've been there, my friend.

429
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:56,383
Even just looking at Lilith now
brings back all the pain

430
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,018
and the torment I've suffered
every second

431
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,486
for the last six months.

432
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,141
Please, put the gun down, Louis.

433
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,176
See, I got through it.

434
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:07,877
So will you.

435
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,846
Just put the gun down.

436
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,099
Nice speech, Crane, but get out

437
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,717
of my way or I swear to God

438
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,586
you're gonna be
the first one to go!

439
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,087
Oh, I can't stand this anymore.

440
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,424
Look, Louis, if you're going
to shoot someone, shoot me.

441
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,225
I won't go back with you,
and you don't want me back.

442
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,093
I'd only make you
more miserable.

443
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,729
I can't shoot you, Lilith.

444
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,666
Well, you're going
to have to do it, Louis.

445
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,467
That's the only way
to end this.

446
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,720
Give me the gun, Louis.

447
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,772
(sobbing)

448
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm sorry, Lilith!

449
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:43,880
Well, Sam, thanks for another
delightful evening at Cheers.

450
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,568
We must do it again sometime.

451
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,620
I'm, uh, sorry about this, John.

452
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,423
Next time you come on down,
drinks are on the house.

453
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,026
Oh, then it's all worthwhile.

454
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:09,273
Boy, look at that
poor mule-yak, huh?

455
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,543
I really pity him.

456
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,761
It really makes you think,
though, doesn't it?

457
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:17,931
Where is that fine line
between sanity and insanity?

458
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,817
Look behind you, Clavin.

459
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,085
You stepped over it
about a year ago.

460
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,906
Are you all right, Lilith?

461
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,075
Yes, I think so.

462
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,709
Good.

463
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:34,181
Frasier...

464
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,550
do we have any chance
for reconciliation?

465
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,807
I'm sorry, Lilith, but no.

466
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:47,344
I just can't go
through this again.

467
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,851
I understand.

468
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:57,120
And I'll respect your wishes.

469
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:03,159
Frasier, you know, I hadn't
realized just how deeply

470
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:06,563
I'd wounded you
until I heard what you said to Louis.

471
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:11,101
All I can say is
please don't hate me forever.

472
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,758
I'll check into a hotel.

473
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:22,929
Maybe we can meet
tomorrow and sort out

474
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:26,884
the... (clears throat)...
divorce proceedings.

475
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:32,455
I think that would be best.

476
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,996
(high-pitched sobs)

477
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:45,919
What's that sound?

478
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,004
(sobs continue)

479
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,624
Sounds like she's got a pretzel
stuck in her throat.

480
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,044
As hard as it may
be to believe,

481
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,015
that is the sound
of my wife... sobbing.

482
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,069
(sobbing continues)

483
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,523
Hey, say something, will you?

484
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:07,825
Just make her stop.

485
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,663
I'll handle this.

486
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,633
Now, Lilith, I'm just
gonna say this once,

487
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:17,701
so hear me.

488
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,035
(sobbing continues)

489
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,371
No matter how much you sob,

490
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:25,476
no matter how much you plead,

491
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:28,278
we are not going to Venus.

492
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,564
Oh, Frasier!

493
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,283
Welcome home, Lilith.

494
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,401
Oh!

495
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,636
Boy, that's beautiful.

496
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:39,873
Start pouring, Wood.
