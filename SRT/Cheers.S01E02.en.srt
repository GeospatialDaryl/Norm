1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,030
Sam, when you were in the back,
one of your women called.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,038
She said to tell you
that you're a lying piece of garbage

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,310
and she never wants to see you again.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,351
Did she leave her name?

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,592
No, but she did tell me
to add one more thing.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,039
What's that?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,109
Yeah, that's Patty.

8
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,750
Your move, Sammy.

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,919
Sam, I'll only ask this once.
If you say no, it's no.

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,079
But I would love to start doing
caricatures of the customers here.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,069
Caricature is a satirical form of art
that the common man loves.

12
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,795
It would be a wonderful memento
of our customers' visits here.

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,750
No.

14
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,236
My art instructor
said I'm an original

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,954
and this would be
an invaluable experience.

16
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,990
No.

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,076
I'd only do it
during the slow periods

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,555
It wouldn't interfere
with waiting tables.

19
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,353
- No.
- What do you say? Can I do it?

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,597
- No.
- We'll talk about it later.

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,909
No, we won't talk about this later.
I don't want you to do that.

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,712
I'm going to do it anyway.

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,360
Well, at least she cleared it
with me first.

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,311
Here you go, Carla.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,591
- Gin Collins, vodka Collins.
- Thanks. Which one's which?

26
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,679
The gin Collins is in Larry,
the vodka Collins is in Steve.

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,072
- Coach, what are you talking about?
- Larry and Steve.

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,716
- You've named the glasses?
- How else do I know which is which?

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,071
I mean, over here is Pete,
Glen, Fred, Al...

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,159
Not to offend the ladies, we've got
Jeannie, Ginger, Gracie, Sally...

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,876
- How do you tell which one is which?
- To me, they're different.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,514
Except the Wilson brothers.

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,634
Afternoon, everybody.

34
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,796
- Norm!
- Norman.

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,797
Gentlemen, start your taps.

36
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,155
- How's it going?
- Not so good.

37
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,589
I missed a digit
in the debit column today.

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,154
The boss is now using my butt
for an ashtray.

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,232
Norm, would you please
watch your language today?

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,794
- Sure. What's the problem?
- Lisa's coming over.

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,350
I didn't know that.
It'll be great to see her.

42
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,708
Who is Lisa?

43
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,276
That's the Coach's daughter.
Or is it a martini glass?

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
- How's she doing?
- She's absolutely wonderful.

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,316
She's introducing me to her fiancé.

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,110
Great.

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,916
You never told me she was engaged.
She said she was married to her work.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,795
Well, like most women, she wants
both. This is the 19... what, '80s?

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,993
Come here.

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,148
- Listen, are you alright?
- You see, I never met the fella.

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,714
I'm just hoping
that I can hit it off with him.

52
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,833
- It's really been bugging me.
- Relax. You're gonna do just fine.

53
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,715
Yeah, I guess I do worry too much.

54
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,593
Since Lisa's mother died,
she's been my whole life.

55
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,269
Coach, you did a great job
with Lisa. Don't worry.

56
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,799
Thanks, Sam.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,319
Great guy, that Sam.

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,829
Why don't you name a glass after him?

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,471
Excuse me, my name is Diane.
I'm the Cheers caricaturist.

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,549
I couldn't help but notice that you
are very much in love with this lady.

61
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,511
And I have a sketch for you.

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,318
Which one of us is that?

63
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,269
That's a pretty good caricature.

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,153
Don't toy with my emotions.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,158
I'm serious.
It looks just like her, I think.

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,309
Of course. Yes, excuse me.

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,915
Hello.

68
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,556
I'm Diane, the Cheers caricaturist.
I have a drawing of you.

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,514
- Let me see.
- Just a minute. Do you have a hobby?

70
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,792
- Horseback riding.
- Yes, that is fun, isn't it?

71
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,796
Now you may look.

72
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,751
This is me?

73
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,871
Why am I sitting on a lizard?

74
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,519
- Daddy!
- Lisa!

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,758
Honey, it's so good to see you.
Everybody, here's my daughter Lisa.

76
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,993
- Hi, Sam.
- How are you doing?

77
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,633
- Really good.
- You look good.

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,955
- Thanks.
- This is Diane.

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,669
- Very nice to meet you.
- You also.

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,233
Where's your fiancé?

81
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,510
Roy'll be right in.
He's parking the car.

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,396
So, where did you meet the guy?

83
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,308
We both work for the same company.
He's our top salesman.

84
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,351
Good for you. That's great.

85
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,993
Everybody!
This is my daughter's fiancé.

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,832
Let's hear it.

87
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,192
Darling. Roy,
this is Carla and Diane and Sam.

88
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,753
- Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,075
And this is my father Ernie.

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,589
- A pleasure to meet you.
- The feeling's ditto.

91
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,111
- Can I get you a nice cold beer?
- Sure, Pops.

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,117
Mind if I smoke?

93
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,959
Listen, cigar smoke bothers me.

94
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,794
I know. It stinks,
but it tastes great.

95
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,635
So, Lisa tells me
you and Sam were in baseball.

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,309
- That's right.
- I think it's a dead sport.

97
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,479
They just haven't claimed the body
yet. People need action these days.

98
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,073
What sport do you like?

99
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,509
Female full-contact karate.

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,952
Excuse me,
I have to go jump-start my brain.

101
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,919
Look out for that one.
She could steal my heart.

102
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,192
Cliff, I smell Chinese food.
It's a cigar.

103
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,556
So, you're a salesman
with my daughter's firm?

104
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,468
Yeah. Talk about coincidence.
Lisa's my district manager.

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,875
Has my fate in her hands.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,357
I'm working Jersey now, but I'm
moving up to Pennsylvania soon.

107
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,835
I suppose
something could be arranged.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,278
- What do you sell?
- Suits door-to-door.

109
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,110
Is this one of the suits here?

110
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,796
- You took the bait, Sam.
- I did?

111
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,318
Hold this.

112
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,236
I'm wearing an Omni suit right now,
and, man, am I comfortable.

113
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,390
The best part is its versatility.

114
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,354
This suit comes with two coats,
three pairs of pants and five vests.

115
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,598
The ensemble makes 120 combinations.
Everything from dignified to sporty.

116
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,029
If you owned one,
you could go from a funeral

117
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
to a night on the town
without even going home.

118
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,628
Well, I was trapped
in just that situation Tuesday night.

119
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,957
We're gonna be late
for our dinner reservation.

120
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,072
Sam, you and I happen.

121
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,079
Catch you later.
Let's go put on the feedbags.

122
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,513
We'll be back in a little while.
Daddy, come with us.

123
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,269
No, you go ahead, I got something
to do. I'll see you later.

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,517
- Alright, I'll see you later.
- Alright.

125
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,036
You know, I am so glad that
you two finally got a chance to meet.

126
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,517
<i>Ciao. Do you get it?
We're going to eat and I said ciao.</i>

127
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,471
<i>Ciao. I'm a funny guy.</i>

128
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,599
Could you cover for me
for a couple of moments?

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,757
- Sure. Where are you going?
- To toss my lunch.

130
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,390
Chuck,
how's the job search going?

131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,556
I got something.
I'm not crazy about it.

132
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,432
I'm a janitor at a biology lab

133
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,394
where they do DNA experiments
making mutant viruses.

134
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,629
- Sounds like a good job to me.
- I don't know.

135
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,196
Makes me a little nervous,
all that weird stuff floating around.

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,278
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't sweat it.

137
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,709
They handle all that stuff.

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,308
You're right.
Must be getting paranoid.

139
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,352
See you later.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,070
I feel better already. Bye-bye.

141
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,589
- Bye.
- Take care, Chuck.

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,518
He used the phone.

143
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,398
The man's a pig.

144
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,430
I just had dinner with a pig.

145
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,995
He's even more disgusting
when he's around food.

146
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,554
- That's hard to believe.
- Hard to believe?

147
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,434
The last thing I saw, he was pulling
his chair up to a dessert cart.

148
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,478
- What will you do about this?
- I gave Lisa everything she wanted.

149
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,309
- What can I do?
- You have to tell her how you feel.

150
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,672
- I can no longer hold my tongue.
- Want me to do it?

151
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,473
Coach, come here.

152
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,790
I'm a daughter myself. Let me
tell you something about my father.

153
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,390
My father
is a very wise and learned man,

154
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,556
but he never gave himself a chance

155
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,955
to get to know the boys
I brought home.

156
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,117
He would decide he didn't like them
for no better reason

157
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,279
than one had bad posture
or another one had facial hair.

158
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,519
I'll never forget
when I was foolish enough

159
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,029
to bring home a utopian socialist.

160
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,628
- Oh, my God!
- No!

161
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,876
I know, it's unbelievable.
I was a rebel then.

162
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,229
The point is, you mustn't make
the mistake of judging too quickly.

163
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,079
- Now, call me crazy...
- You are crazy.

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,710
Very funny. What I am struggling to
say is, call me a bleeding heart...

165
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,070
You're a bleeding heart.

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,679
Call me cute as a button.

167
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,073
Fine.

168
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,676
Coach, I'm a humanist.

169
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,597
That means that I have to believe

170
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,951
there's something fine and noble
about every human being.

171
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,470
If we haven't found
what's fine and noble about Roy yet,

172
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,239
it means that we haven't looked
deeply enough.

173
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,476
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

174
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,912
Your mother!

175
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,792
Like no one ever knocked over
a dessert cart before.

176
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,515
How about a beer?

177
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,960
Look, you've gotta talk to her.

178
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,548
Coach, you have to give Roy
a chance.

179
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,069
- You don't.
- That's not a bad restaurant.

180
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,590
The dessert guy's a dink
but the cuisine was tasty.

181
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,551
But what am I telling you, chubs?

182
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,033
- Where's Lisa?
- She's upstairs settling the bill.

183
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,275
Are you saying
you had her pay for dinner?

184
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,472
They wouldn't take
a post-dated four-party cheque.

185
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,871
If they're going to be hard-nosed,
they should put up a sign.

186
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,438
Do you still say
there's something good in that?

187
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,319
There must be.

188
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,674
Roy, how about if
you and I chat over here?

189
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,119
Good idea.

190
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,356
Will you excuse us for a moment?

191
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,835
The suit's getting to you, isn't it?

192
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,157
Roy, your personality is very...

193
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,757
- ... strong.
- Amen.

194
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,838
But I know that's not the real you.

195
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,438
You know, an aggressive personality
is often a mask

196
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,393
for a very shy and sensitive soul.

197
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,159
I'm willing to gamble
that you are such a person.

198
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,594
You're not wearing a bra, are you?

199
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,596
The man is pond scum.

200
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,829
Coach?

201
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,949
Stop her. Lock her in the car
if you have to, but stop her.

202
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,877
Sam, I can't stop her. She wants him.

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,309
Sam, I haven't forgotten about you.

204
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,954
How about I run to the car
for cloth swatches?

205
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,152
I can be out there
before you can scream no 700 times.

206
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,078
- You better be quick.
- You better be quick.

207
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,033
Coach, let me talk to you.

208
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,439
Do you remember a double-header
against Cleveland

209
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,518
on a hot August day, 1974?

210
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,756
Yeah, I remember part of that.

211
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,031
- What part?
- I remember hot.

212
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,755
Well, that's good.
That's a beginning.

213
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,798
Do you remember I was on the mound?

214
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,230
Johnson had been thrown out.
You filled in as manager.

215
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,319
It was the last inning. I had
just walked. The base was loaded.

216
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,154
- Gosh, who was up?
- Charlie Spikes.

217
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,838
That's it. Charlie Spikes.

218
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,430
Anyway, you came out
to the mound to talk to me.

219
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,358
I was in a jam.
I didn't have any good stuff left.

220
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,153
I thought you were going to yank me
but you didn't.

221
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,352
Instead, you said
that something I've never forgotten.

222
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,436
Do you remember what you said?

223
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,073
What did I say?

224
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,077
You said, "Go get him. "

225
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,715
- I said that?
- Yeah. And I got him, Coach.

226
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,434
Well, I was glad to be there
to help out.

227
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,710
I'm glad you were there, too.

228
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,877
If you hadn't said that,
my career may have ended that day,

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,231
instead of when it did,
a couple of weeks later.

230
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,755
What the hell
are we talking about this now for?

231
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,279
Go get him.

232
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,997
- Hi, Daddy.
- Get him.

233
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,079
Lisa, I want to talk to you
about Roy here in Sam's office.

234
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,917
Go get him.
What a marvellously pithy phrase.

235
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,430
That's exactly what
our third baseman said at the time.

236
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,479
I'm sorry, Lisa.

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,993
The time has come to put my foot in
my mouth. You cannot marry this man.

238
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,795
You absolutely, positively
cannot marry this man.

239
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,474
I never heard you
talk like this before.

240
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,354
Well, now you have. I'll tell you
something. I don't like this guy Roy.

241
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,756
I don't like Charlie Spikes.
You can't marry either one of them.

242
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,832
Look, Daddy, I'm not dumb.

243
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,953
I know Roy's abrasive.
I know he's insensitive.

244
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,119
I know he's probably only marrying
me so he can get Pennsylvania.

245
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,311
But why would you want
to marry a man like this?

246
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,678
Isn't it obvious to you?

247
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,317
Nothing's ever obvious to me.

248
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,236
Daddy, don't make me say this.

249
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,114
What?

250
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,317
I wanna be married
and I wanna have children.

251
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,871
Roy is the first man
that asked me to marry him

252
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,991
and I'm afraid
he's gonna be the last.

253
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,278
Honey, there must've been dozens
of young fellas that proposed to you.

254
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,995
No, Daddy, wake up.
Roy is the first one ever.

255
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,998
- But you're so beautiful, so...
- Beautiful?

256
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,395
You have been saying
that I'm beautiful

257
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,556
ever since I was a very little girl.

258
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,352
But look at me.

259
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,711
Not as my father. Like you're
looking at me for the first time.

260
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,355
And please try to see me
as I really am.

261
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,309
Oh, my God, I didn't realise
how much you looked like your mother.

262
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,036
I know. I look exactly like her,
and Mom was not...

263
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,235
...comfortable about her beauty.

264
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,440
But that's what made her
more beautiful.

265
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,352
Your mother grew
more beautiful every day of her life.

266
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,796
- She was really beautiful.
- Yes, and so are you.

267
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,238
You're the most beautiful kid
in the whole world.

268
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,999
Thanks, Daddy.

269
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,359
Go ahead.

270
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,357
Come on, go ahead, try it.

271
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,348
The man doesn't lie.
The stuff won't burn.

272
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,072
That's a drawback.

273
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,875
Roy?

274
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,993
About time.
What were you talking about in there?

275
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,792
We were talking about me.

276
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,309
My father thinks I'm beautiful.
Do you?

277
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,555
What?

278
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,632
Of course you're beautiful.

279
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,799
You're stylish, you're contemporary
and you travel well.

280
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,796
You just said that about your suits.

281
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,439
Roy, I don't want to marry you.

282
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,473
I decided that I want a man
as good as my father.

283
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,149
Hold on here.
What about Pennsylvania?

284
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,317
Roy, you don't get Pennsylvania
and you don't get me.

285
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,034
You just get more and more obnoxious.

286
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,679
Look, it's not like this marriage
was gonna change my life.

287
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,237
But I want you to know that if I walk
out that door right now, I'm gone.

288
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,874
Do you hear what I said?

289
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,956
Is that what you want, Lisa?

290
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,153
- That's what I want.
- Then that's what you got.

291
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,399
Goodbye, baby.

292
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,438
Don't bother calling me
cos we're through.

293
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,598
This doesn't mean
we can't put you in a new suit.

294
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,957
You've made me so happy. I mean it.

295
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,792
Care to capture this moment
in a caricature?

296
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,393
No. Tacky.

297
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,757
Come on, let's celebrate.
I'll buy you some ice cream.

298
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,915
Daddy, no.

299
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,112
I'm not in the mood for ice cream.
I just lost my fiancé.

300
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,028
He wasn't the greatest guy, but
it'll take a while to get over it.

301
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,628
- Rocky Road?
- You got it.

302
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,034
- Can we go?
- Take off.

303
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,072
- I got him.
- You got him.

304
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,872
So long, everybody.

305
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,798
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lisa.

306
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,270
Lisa made the right decision.

307
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,909
- Forgive my storybook mentality...
- You're forgiven.

308
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,357
Well, laugh if you will.

309
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,277
Every woman has a Mr Right in mind.

310
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,960
It's a mistake
to settle for anyone less.

311
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,913
Do you have a Mr Right in mind?

312
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,309
Well, I suppose I do.
Every woman does.

313
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,113
- What's he like?
- Come on.

314
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,028
No, come on, maybe I know the guy.
Maybe I know him real well...

315
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,109
Well, for one thing,
he would be very intelligent.

316
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,593
Very well educated.

317
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,359
Perhaps overeducated,
if there is such a thing.

318
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,110
Not particularly athletic, perhaps
even clumsy, but charmingly so.

319
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,472
Blond, blue-eyed,
with a Byron-like innocence.

320
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,956
- I know this person.
- Who?

321
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,116
You.
You described yourself perfectly.

322
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,310
I hope you'll be very happy together.

323
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,910
- I have had enough...
- Don't throw that.

324
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,396
That's Herbie. He's got a wife
and four little shot glasses.
