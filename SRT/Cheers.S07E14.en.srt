2
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:05,753
Sounds great, Kelly.      
     I'll see you Saturday.

3
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:07,755
Yeah. Okay.

4
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:09,257
Guess what, guys?       
What?

5
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,893
I'm going to my first      
      country club dance.

6
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:13,061
SAM:                            
Whoo-hoo!                       
                All right.

7
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,430
Yeah, I gotta check       
    the bus schedule.

8
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:16,731
Wait, wait, Woody--       
     you're going out with

9
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:18,733
the boss's daughter and you're 
    riding around on a bus?

10
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,685
Yeah, it's getting to be    
    a real drag, too.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,787
Especially when         
    you can't sit together.

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,941
Maybe I can borrow Sam's car.

13
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:27,942
CLIFF:             
        Whoa, whoa, hey.

14
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,177
Hold up there, Woodster.

15
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,979
Lest you forget the
             Ten Commandments   
             of Sam Malone.

16
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:33,331
Hence, commandment              
number three:

17
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:35,032
"Thou shall not
                 loan thy car."

18
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,968
I thought that was              
commandment number four.

19
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,202
That's              
            "Honor thy hair."

20
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:42,073
I think Sam might make     
          an exception

21
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:43,858
in my case.
                     Hey, Sam?

22
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,711
Sam?

23
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:47,695
Can I borrow your car?

24
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,347
My car?

25
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,815
Yeah, I'll be real              
careful with it.

26
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:51,983
( <i>laughing</i> )

27
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,702
No, I'll bring it home early

28
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,704
and I'll wash it                
the next day.

29
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,088
( <i>cackling</i> )

30
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,606
Well, food for thought.

31
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,644
So, Wood, is he gonna   
        loan you the car?

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,247
He didn't come right out and  
 say it, but I like my chances.

33
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:07,915
He's in a great mood today.

34
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:12,887
( <i>laughing hysterically</i> )

35
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:17,041

51
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,124
I wish you luck, Woody,

52
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:24,909
because if Sam does
             lend you that car,

53
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:25,793
you're home free.

54
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:28,212
That thing is          
     a rolling aphrodisiac.

55
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,664
Absolutely.           
You know, any female that rides

56
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:30,865
around with Sam in that car...

57
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:31,866
Yeah?

58
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,134
...ends up going straight       
        to bed with him.

59
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,403
I've ridden in that car.

60
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,954
Right.

61
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,158
Well, I didn't go           
    to bed with him.

62
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:43,261
Huh. Right, and they
            always deny it

63
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,962
afterwards,
                     you know?

64
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,664
I hate you guys.

65
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,402
Yeah, then they always cop that 
 anti-male attitude, you know?

66
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,053
Oh, Sammy, mind if I cut out  
          for an hour?

67
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,390
I want to catch                 
the last couple of innings

68
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,124
of my kid Ludlow's              
T-ball game.

69
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,361
Hey, I thought he was the       
  intellectual of the family.

70
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:00,395
He's into baseball, huh?

71
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,464
Well, he didn't go willingly.

72
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:03,898
I had to trick him.

73
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:05,933
I used the old         
     "going to the library

74
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,201
"but running out of gas

75
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,070
in front of the ballpark"       
            routine.

76
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,022
Seems kind of drastic,
          doesn't it?

77
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,390
Come on, Sammy,                 
please.

78
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,258
I don't want                    
the kid growing up

79
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,794
to be a soft,                   
doughy wimp

80
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,329
wearing an argyle sweater       
and smoking a pipe.

81
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,036
SAM:               
             Go ahead, take off.

82
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,871
And don't worry about Lud;      
         he'll be fine.

83
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,307
"Lud: you know,   
              that's Carla's son

84
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:32,643
by Bennett Ludlow.      
        He's a cute little tyke.

85
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,845
Carla bore a son                
to Bennett Ludlow--

86
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,215
the eminent psychiatrist,       
your mentor?

87
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:38,682
Oh, this is prime dish.

88
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:41,786
I can't wait                    
to tell the girls               
in the sleep disorder lab.

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,122
So, Carla, tell, tell.

90
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,257
Have you bedded                 
any other Rhodes scholars?

91
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,263
Uh... no.

92
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,965
But one egghead, long-distance, 
        phone-in father

93
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,900
is enough for          
    this baby factory.

94
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,802
In spite of the fact      
     that Dr. Ludlow's work

95
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:59,203
takes him out          
        of the country,

96
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm sure he's          
      a marvelous parent.

97
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,827
No, a good parent           
    is someone who's there.

98
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,528
Who's there to help them out  
      with their homework.

99
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,398
There when they wake up     
in the middle of the night

100
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,699
crying their eyes out.

101
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,634
He's there with         
     the bottle of Bactine

102
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,603
when they give themselves       
         a bad tattoo.

103
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,790
Well, I've been there.

104
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,426
I raised eight kids       
    on a waitress's salary,

105
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,594
and I want you to know     
     they're all good kids,

106
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,029
and not one of them             
has had a conviction

107
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,565
that stood up on appeal.

108
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,169
I stand corrected, Carla.

109
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:33,904
Mom, how could you

110
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,823
do that to me?

111
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,291
Luddy, how did you          
        get here?

112
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:38,726
Did the coach drop you off?

113
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:39,577
Yes.

114
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,579
Oh, then the game               
ended early.

115
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,580
So how'd you do?

116
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,834
Coach me had on the bench       
         all afternoon.

117
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,135
Well, what do you mean?

118
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,502
You didn't play at all?

119
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,221
Well, they finally put me in

120
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,989
after the kid          
    with the cast on his leg

121
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:54,526
and the two fat girls left.

122
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,495
So what did you do?

123
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,399
I hit the ball,         
 but they <i>still</i> made fun of me.

124
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,735
Like everybody's just supposed 
to <i>know</i> which way to run.

125
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,156
I'm going to go clean up        
your specs.

126
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,093
Carla's got herself a real      
Poindexter there, huh?

127
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,178
Yeah.

128
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,179
It's sad to say

129
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,946
that kids not accepted          
by their peers

130
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,882
really never learn how          
to get along with people

131
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,016
in the big grown-up world.

132
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,485
Why is that, Cliff?

133
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,655
'Cause they keep    
            boring everyone and 
            driving them crazy

134
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,791
with long speeches      
        filled with meaningless 
        statistics?

135
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:27,792
Yep, yeah.

136
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:32,163
63% of them live lives          
of quiet desperation.

137
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,399
And how about those     
        who sit next to them?

138
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:39,036
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane,     
a friend of your father's.

139
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,037
I understand

140
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,039
you had a rough 
                afternoon.

141
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,442
You must never let the bullies 
         of this world

142
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,910
diminish your inner spirit

143
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,878
nor put out the fire      
  of your competitive nature.

144
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,046
Sir?                    
                    Yes, son?

145
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,549
You're kneeling         
          on some gum.

146
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,286
Heavens,            
            my new gabardines!

147
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,287
You and gum.

148
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,223
He attracts it  
                like a magnet.

149
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,125
We'll swing by our place

150
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,793
and pick up another pair
        on our way to the opera.

151
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,995
Which opera are you going to?

152
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,915
<i>Die Meistersinger.</i>

153
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,483
Oh, I know that one.

154
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:10,985
That's where all        
    the master singers

155
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,022
get together in Nuremberg       
     and have a big contest

156
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:15,790
to find out who's best.

157
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,876
Oh, yeah, kind of           
    like <i>Star Search.</i>

158
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,379
Basically.

159
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,015
Frasier...

160
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,420
Frasier, I just had             
a delicious idea.

161
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,621
Why don't we buy                
an extra ticket

162
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,723
and take young Lud              
to the opera with us?

163
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,057
LUD:                            
Oh, wow, great!

164
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:36,327
But I have to ask my mom.

165
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,196
Mommy, Dr. Crane and his wife

166
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,798
invited me to go        
    to the opera with them.

167
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:42,316
Well, you don't     
            have to be polite.

168
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,018
Just tell them to bug off.

169
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,524
But, Mom, I <i>want</i> to go.     
            Please?

170
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:51,425
Carla, may I have a word        
with you?

171
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,228
Yeah. Sammy,        
            entertain the kid.

172
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,999
Carla, you'd be doing   
        us all a favor.

173
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,401
Allowing Frasier and me 
        to spend some time

174
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:03,337
with your son might help us 
    to formulate a decision

175
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:06,073
that's been under much  
        discussion as of late.

176
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:08,809
You see, the two of us are  
    considering whether or not

177
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:10,678
we wish to reproduce.

178
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:15,232
You're thinking                 
of having a baby, huh?

179
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,335
So, tell me,                    
how long does it take

180
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,337
one of your pods                
to hatch, anyway?

181
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,810
Listen, you want                
to baby-sit Lud,                
be my guest.

182
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,411
What's that                     
on your shirt?

183
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,980
Huh? Ooh!

184
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:33,150
You're good.
                    You're good.

185
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,520
Okay, Luddy,                    
you're going to the opera.

186
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,054
Yay!

187
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,372
Yeah, you're going              
to love it, kid, too.

188
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:39,440
You know that Wagner,

189
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,475
he wrote all those pieces       
when he was stone deaf.

190
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,760
No, that was Beethoven.

191
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,594
I meant blind.

192
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,079
That was Milton.

193
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:46,263
He had warts.

194
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:47,632
That was you.

195
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,135
I told you                      
not to tell anybody.

196
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:57,775
Shouldn't they be back          
by now?

197
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,011
How long can an opera last?

198
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,362
Well, the last one              
I remember

199
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,930
lasted about eight months.

200
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,702
Yeah, I just hope           
    everything's all right.

201
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:12,156
Carla, look, I know 
            you love your kids  
            and everything...

202
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,092
I mean, like your kids.

203
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:18,396
I mean, I know  
                you have kids...

204
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,698
but I have never seen you   
    this concerned before.

205
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,649
Well, Lud's special.

206
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah?

207
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,801
Yeah.

208
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,237
I mean, whenever I come home  
        at night,

209
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,973
he always brings me a pan       
of hot water for my feet.

210
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,542
He actually asks me       
        how my day went.

211
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,429
I don't know                    
if I ever told                  
anybody this before...

212
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:35,430
I love him.

213
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:38,132
You don't have to be
            shy about saying

214
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,100
that you love   
                your kids.

215
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,653
Oh, why don't you just take out 
an ad in the Yellow Pages?

Hey, Normie, I almost forgot

218
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:50,528
how much Sam's Corvette girls  
        love to whistle.

I heard that sound, huh?

222
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,469
Classic slamming of the door.

So Sam still    
                won't loan you  
                his car, huh?

225
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:11,732
No, but I'm starting      
to love that man's laugh.

226
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,151
Sammy, come on,
                 give the kid a 
                 break, will ya?

227
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,020
Just let him    
                borrow your car.

00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:16,670
Please, Sam?

229
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:18,188
Kelly's the best girl

Well, I tell you what, Woody.

00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,877
I'll give her a lift in my car.

No way, Sammy.

239
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,458
It's okay, Sam, I understand  
      about the car thing.

Oh, good.

let me borrow your car,     
    there's no hard feelings.

And if I ever have  
            a car of my own,

245
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,519
and you want    
                to borrow it,   
                it's yours.

Ah, I know what                 
you're trying to do.

No, I'm not.

Mom, Mom!               
    The opera was so great!

All the singing,                
and costumes.

This was the best

He's an extraordinary child.

264
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,980
Yes, we had             
        an extensive discussion

265
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:34,849
on the way back 
                about opera,

266
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,634

Oh, Carla, may we take Lud      
to the movies tonight?

268

and then we were thinking       
he could sleep over,

270
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,994
We could have brunch and a      
matinee of <i>Peter and the Wolf.</i>

Gee, I don't know.

     away from home before.

                one last time

00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,536
that you haven't

No, get out of my face          
before I hurt ya.

00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,082
He's special.

294
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:47,889
Hey, Carla, still listening   
      to that opera stuff?

295
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,357
She can't       
                hear you, Cliff.

296
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,126
She's got the music 
            blasting in her ear.

297
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,661
You mean she                    
can't hear me

298
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:55,329
if I say                        
she reminds me of

299
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:57,965
one of those little             
plastic troll dolls?

300
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,302
Hey, what's...         
      what's the big idea?

301
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:03,871
I thought               
     you couldn't hear me.

302
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:05,556
No, but I can see,  
            and you're ugly.

303
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,763
So, are you still cramming all  
that high-Q stuff in your head?

304
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,566
You know, Sammy, I      
        don't have any choice.

305
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,669
I mean, ever since      
        Dr. Cyclops and Morticia

306
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,139
started introducing 
            Lud to all this     
            culture crap,

307
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,974
it's like I don't   
            have anything to    
            talk to him about.

308
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:26,026
So I'm listening    
            to all this music,

309
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,829
and I'm plowing through 
        all these books here.

310
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,330
Look at this.

311
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,999
Good heavens, man.

312
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,868
<i>History of Modern Art.</i>

313
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:39,406
<i>Comprehensive Guide</i>            
 <i>to the World Of Opera.</i>

314
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,274
<i>Hollywood Wives.</i>

315
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,694
Yeah, I'm getting       
        into literature, too.

316
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,697
I've read this.

317
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:53,020
Oh, man, who am 
                I trying to kid?

318
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,922
I'm just stupid.

319
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:55,990
Hey, you are not stupid.

320
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:59,493
Oh, how would you know? 
        You're stupid.

321
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,462
If you were really stupid,      
you wouldn't know that about me.

322
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,798
Good point.

323
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,299
Greetings, Carla.

324
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,235
We just dropped     
            your son off at home

325
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,620
after a lovely sojourn

326
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,321
at the Museum   
                of Fine Art.

327
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,891
You know, that child
            is such a love.

328
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,277
He's so bright, 
                inquisitive,    
                creative.

329
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,880
He reminds me of    
            myself as a child.

330
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,982
Of course,          
            he has more hair.

331
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:23,934
We were wondering               
if we could

332
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,536
treat Lud to dinner             
this evening.

333
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,321
Come on, guys.

334
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,757
You've had him out              
every night this week.

335
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,459
Besides, I had a special    
    family evening planned.

336
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:34,562
I was gonna cook        
      a big bowl of pasta,

337
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,831
and we're all gonna       
      sit around and watch

338
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,332
<i>America's Most Wanted,</i>

339
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,234
and see if we could       
     rat on our neighbors.

340
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:45,005
Yes, but, you see, Carla,       
     this is special, too.

341
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,675
I mean, I've just managed       
    to finagle reservations

342
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,176
for Magritte's.

343
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,845
It's the most exclusive     
  restaurant in all of Boston.

344
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,996
I never heard of it.

345
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:53,714
Precisely.

346
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,117
Carla, please.

347
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,886
It would mean a lot       
         to the child,

348
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,223
and I think Lud         
      would enjoy it also.

349
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,508
Oh, all right.  
                Who cares?

350
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,477
More spaghetti for  
            the rest of us.

351
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,881
SAM:        
                    Hey, Fras.

352
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:14,385
Listen, why don't you invite  
Carla to dinner with you?

353
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,920
Well, now, Sam, uh...

354
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:20,690
Carla is a fine woman   
        and a good friend.

355
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,691
Actually,       
                she's neither.

356
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,227
And why would I want
            to eat with her?

357
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,099
Frasier, dear, I think          
we should invite Carla.

358
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,635
I think it would                
be very, very nice.

359
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,540
Do you know what    
            would be very,      
            very nice, Lilith?

360
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:40,144
If you would stop   
            digging your nails  
            into my palm.

361
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:42,146
But I'm sure I'll choose
        to see your point

362
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,681
before you draw blood.

363
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,989
Carla? Carla, what say     
        we make it four

364
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,592
at Magritte's                   
tonight, huh?

365
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:55,058
You buying?

366
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:57,178
I'm going.

367
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,013
Well, good.                     
We're on, then.

368
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:00,514
We'll call for you at 8:00.

369
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:03,951
By the way, Carla,  
            please bear in mind

370
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,786
that this is a very

371
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,772
posh establishment.

372
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,306
Need I say more?

373
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,307
Oh, no, no, no.

374
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:11,709
I get the picture           
        loud and clear.

375
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,578
I'll shave my legs.

376
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,718
I hope this table               
is satisfactory.

377
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,252
Oh, this is wonderful.

378
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,855
You know, the place is just   
     as I had heard it was.

379
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,024
It's delightful.

380
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:33,280
Everything looks        
     absolutely exquisite.

381
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,950
The menu is           
    a delightful combination

382
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:39,486
of nouvelle and provincial

383
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,922
with a nod toward           
     domestic ingredients.

384
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:46,643
And get a load                  
of all this ambiance.

385
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,145
The artwork 
                    is stunning.

386
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,382
Yes, well, there's  
            a delightful example
            of modern art.

387
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:58,505
If I might venture a guess,     
I would say it's a "Schnaybel."

388
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,673
It isn't.

389
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,676
But, even if it was, it would be
    pronounced "Schnahbel."

390
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,979
Excuse me.              
It's a little hard to tell

391
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:07,147
this far from our "tahbel."

392
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:11,585
That's funny, Mom.

393
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,937
Ludlow, please,                 
we're not here to have fun.

394
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,806
We're here                      
to enjoy ourselves.

395
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,441
Now...

396
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,609
would it                        
please everyone

397
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,243
if I ordered                    
for the whole table?

398
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,412
It would        
                be delightful.

399
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,413
Fine. Thank you.

400
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,414
Now, I know that

401
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:24,948
Lilith's delicate constitution

402
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:26,350
is not amenable to shallots.

403
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,686
Is there anything else      
    I should be mindful of?

404
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,455
How considerate of you     
        to ask, Frasier.

405
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,191
Actually, I have a delicate   
     constitution, as well.

406
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,427
No extra-heavy barbecue sauce.

407
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,295
I'll be repeating           
    like a Howitzer.

408
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,169
Delightful.

409
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:52,643
Boy, this sure  
                beats taking the
                bus, doesn't it?

410
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:56,012
Just you and me,
                the open road.

411
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:02,285
I'm getting kind    
            of tired of driving.

412
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,255
What do you say     
            we park somewhere

413
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,090
and look at the stars   
        for a while?

414
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,626
Oh, that sounds                 
nice, Woody.

415
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:13,263
Hey, Sam, where's   
            a good place        
            to go next?

416
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:15,216
SAM:            
                Make a right    
                at the light!

417
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,618
And not so      
                fast this time!

418
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,461
Thank you.

419
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:28,929
Oh, and please tell Paul

420
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,732
that the salad course           
was an absolute treasure.

421
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,700
His subtle                      
yet assertive dressing

422
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:36,103
was the perfect balance         
for the arugula.

423
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,389
I concur in spades.

424
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,627
He'll be pleased
                to hear it.

425
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:47,447
Well, shall                     
we bouillabaisse?

426
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:49,567
Ah, now...

427
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,870
smell                           
the piquant bouquet.

428
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:55,138
Taste it with every             
part of your tongue,

429
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,641
and then let it just            
dance down your throat.

430
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,643
Frasier, as usual,  
            your anticipation

431
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,779
is interfering      
            with my enjoyment.

432
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,186
Yeah, Eddie has         
    that problem, too.

433
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,310
Ludlow, you're not eating.

434
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:19,012
None for me,          
    thanks, Dr. Crane.

435
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:22,149
He doesn't like fish.

436
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,185
Look, Carla,                    
this is not something

437
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,086
that comes out                  
of your cupboard

438
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:28,189
in a tin can                    
with a mermaid on it.

439
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,725
This is <i>fruits de mer.</i>

440
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,930
At $32 a pop, I think           
the lad should give it a try.

441
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,851
Now, Ludlow, you've             
been very open-minded

442
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,553
about everything else.

443
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,287
Make him happy. Take a bite.

444
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:45,789
If you don't like it,

445
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,191
you can spit it out       
      in your napkin. See?

446
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,696
Carla, we are not here          
to make me happy.

447
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,482
We are here to enrich           
the lad's experience,

448
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,402
which, if I must say so,        
I do believe is my provenance.

449
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:04,107
Now, Lud, you know we all have  
certain things we don't like.

450
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,078
I detested fish         
      when I was a child,

451
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,949
but I kept eating it and,       
finally, I overcame my aversion.

452
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,200
LILITH:                         
Likewise.

453
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,601
When I first
                    met Frasier,

454
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,303
I detested him.

455
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:22,642
Yes, but the point              
is you love me now.

456
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,544
And Lud will          
      love bouillabaisse.

457
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,847
Try it.

458
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,599
Okay.

459
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:35,289
Eww! Fish!

460
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:36,924
You barely                      
tasted the broth.

461
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,993
Give it a better                
chance than that.

462
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,395
No! I want  
                    a hamburger!

463
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,199
This restaurant does            
not serve hamburgers.

464
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,302
Now, eat                        
your bouillabaisse.

465
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:50,037
No! This fishy soup stinks!

466
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,989
And I hate it!

467
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,694
What an imp!

468
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,448
Luddy?      
What are you doing?

469
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,417
I'm going to try to get him   
     out from under there.

470
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,519
No, Carla. Carla,               
that's exactly what             
he wants you to do.

471
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,638
One must not play               
the game by his rules.

472
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,740
Now, I've taught                
a seminar or two

473
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:11,992
on developmental                
behavior,

474
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:14,527
and the first rule in           
these acting-out situations

475
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,597
is to simply ignore             
the offending child.

476
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,865
Just pretend that               
he doesn't exist.

477
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,485
Eventually, he'll               
get bored and come out.

478
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,121
So... what a lovely meal.

479
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,059
Mmm! Do you know,               
I heard

480
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:32,362
that the chef here              
was a protégé of...

481
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,931
Do you smell        
            something burning?

482
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,734
Yes. That's my shoe.

483
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,803
I heard that                    
he was a protégé of...

484
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,172
Your shoe   
                    is on fire? 
        Yes.

485
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,040
LILITH:                         
Isn't that painful?

486
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,876
Excruciating.

487
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,748
But I'm not going               
to give the child

488
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,183
the pleasure                    
of hearing me cry out.

489
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,419
So, you see,

490
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:57,788
it seems                        
he was educated

491
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,857
in a small village              
on the Rhine.

492
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,792
He...

493
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,160
Oh, Lud.

494
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:08,766
One hotfoot might               
be considered                   
a puckish prank.

495
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,136
But, if you light               
that other match,

496
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,139
it is the end                   
of our tutelage.

497
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,440
Is that                         
perfectly clear?

498
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,760
That's it!

499
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:21,478
That's it! I've had it!

500
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,480
That severs                     
the relationship!

501
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:24,981
Frasier,        
                everyone thinks

502
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:28,151
you're arguing  
                with your clams.

503
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:40,029
Is there                        
a problem here?

504
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,015
No, no. Of course not.

505
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,883
The boy just slipped
            under the table,

506
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,152
and his mother was      
        about to get him out.

507
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,672
His mother.                     
Uh... yes, yes.

508
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,940
Carla, could you                
take care of this?

509
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,010
Gee, I don't know if I could.

510
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:56,613
I... I've never taken      
     a psychology seminar.

511
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,784
Sir, we have a very             
nice table in the kitchen.

512
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,455
Please, Carla.                  
Please, please.

513
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,692
Hey, Lud, burger time.

514
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,961
Yay!

515
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,263
Ha-ha!          
                Hotfoot, huh?

516
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,999
My genes must          
     be in there somewhere.

517
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:19,653
Let's go, Mommy.

518
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:22,021
First, apologize
                to Dr. Crane.

519
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:24,541
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.

520
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,043
I guess I shouldn't       
      have acted this way.

521
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:29,012
Well, no hard                   
feelings, son.

522
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,314
Let's have dinner               
again sometime

523
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:34,350
when you're about,              
oh, in your late 30s.

524
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:35,235
Bye.

525
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,486
Bye.

526
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,157
Uh... I was wondering.

527
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,658
Do you have frog legs?

528
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:42,659
Why, yes.

529
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:43,827
They're     
                    nice pants.

530
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,128
No one will 
                    ever notice.

531
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,129
( <i>laughing</i> )

532
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,630
I always wanted 
                to do that.

533
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:49,733
You're the best mommy           
in the world.

534
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,969
Yeah. Tell me   
                something       
                I don't know.

535
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:56,473
You know, Lilith,   
            I think we've all

536
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,242
learned something   
            here tonight.

537
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,410
I'm going to try        
     to tell you what it is

538
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,846
before you coat         
 my blistering feet with butter

539
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,015
and drop me off         
     at the emergency room.

540
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:14,925
You see...

541
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,126
this incident has made something
    very clear to me.

542
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:21,130
I... I believe my initial       
    instincts were correct.

543
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:22,866
We shouldn't have children.

544
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,335
I don't think I'd   
            make a good father.

545
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,303
I don't want to be a father.

546
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:28,972
I'll never be a father.

547
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,741
End of discussion.

548
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,043
Frasier, I'm pregnant.

549
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:35,562
I'm gonna be a daddy?

550
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:38,097
I'm gonna be a daddy!

551
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:40,683
<i>Oh, Lilith, we must</i>      
      <i>come here more often.</i>
