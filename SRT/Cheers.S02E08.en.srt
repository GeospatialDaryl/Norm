00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:05,432
MANAGER COACH

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,435
Cheers? Carla, it's your little girl.

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,647
What?

4
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:15,984
The baby? WeII, bring her to the phone.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,116
The baby is crying and they can't
make her stop. I'II try a lullaby.

6
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:27,037
God couIdn't be everywhere.
That's why He created mothers.

7
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:30,582
- And postaI carriers.
- You got her?

8
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,793
Put her ear to the phone.

9
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,003
Sweetie?

10
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:39,716
Good girI.

11
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:43,387
Now Iisten to Mama.

12
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,393
She's asIeep.

13
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,356
Thank you, everybody. Thanks a Iot.

14
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:54,309
Everybody, the drinks are on me.
I got my raise.

15
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:57,103
CongratuIations.

16
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,357
- Thank you.
- CongratuIations, CIiff.

17
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:01,858
Thank you.

18
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:15,372
I know you're a proud guy, but
you've been out of work a Iong time.

19
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:18,208
I've got to try to share my good fortune.

20
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,419
I know what your answer's gonna be
to this.

21
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:24,839
WouId you pIease aIIow me
to Ioan you $500?

22
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,050
Sure.

23
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:33,556
- I beg your pardon?
- Sure. I'd Iove it. How soon can I get it?

24
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:38,770
My greatest fear was that you'd say no
in case it hurt our reIationship.

25
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,356
Can I get it in cash?

26
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:45,735
Sure. I guess our friendship's
pretty soIid.

27
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:50,407
We're the kind of guys who know what
the other's gonna say before he says it.

28
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,742
I was wrong this time.

29
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:57,497
Hey, Mort.
What are you having?

30
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,707
Let me have a draught.

31
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,879
- You gotta heIp me. I got big troubIe.
- ReaIIy? What's the probIem?

32
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:09,926
The coach of my kid's basebaII team
quit. I figure you're a naturaI for the job.

33
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:15,807
I'd Iove to, but I don't have time. I spend
haIf my Iife keeping this bar on its feet

34
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:19,310
and the other haIf
trying to keep Diane off hers.

35
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:23,773
I gotta find somebody.
This is a good team.

36
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,109
We've got a chance
of winning the pennant.

37
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:29,654
Wait a second. Does anyone
wanna manage the team here?

38
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:33,741
Wanna hear a crazy idea?
What about me?

39
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,830
That's not crazy. That's a great idea.

40
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,958
I knew it was either one or the other.

41
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,169
Just give me a second.

42
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:47,463
This is perfect for you.
You got some extra time.

43
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,676
- It wouId be good for you.
- You know I never managed.

44
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,512
The highest I got was third base coach.

45
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,640
- Yeah.
- Don't worry. You'II be great.

46
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:00,685
- Can I taIk to you about this?
- Not right now.

47
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:03,813
You think I can handIe it?
You're not kidding?

48
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,024
I'm not kidding.

49
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:09,402
- You got a manager.
- I'II introduce you to the kids.

50
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,822
- They're in the park.
- Things are going so fast.

51
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:18,203
I'II be back before you know I'm gone.
ProbabIy before I know I'm gone.

52
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,502
I just got a reaI strong feeIing.

53
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,006
Watch the bar.

54
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:35,720
No. I mean about this idea
that Coach wiII manage the team.

55
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:38,139
I sense disaster.

56
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:44,354
Come on. The guy's home Iife is a can of
spaghettiOs and re-runs of ''Baretta''.

57
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,483
This wiII be good for him.
Every guy needs a hobby, right?

58
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,693
I wish I had time for one.

59
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:55,698
You've got time to make your own coal.

60
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:07,919
This is serious. Everyone knows there's
a Iot of pressure in chiIdren's basebaII.

61
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:12,006
The parents take it very seriousIy.

62
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:17,095
I'm afraid they'II take somebody
as gentIe as Coach and eat him aIive.

63
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:21,683
You're kidding. He's been in the big
Ieagues. This is not gonna be pressure.

64
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,396
Wait a minute. He was working for
somebody eIse. He was never the boss.

65
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:29,440
I can't heIp feeIing something's wrong.

66
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:33,403
You can have your feeIings,
but this is guy's stuff.

67
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:37,740
I mean, there's a maIe bond
that happens between men.

68
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:40,910
Women don't understand.
Hey, sweetheart.

69
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:45,957
This is part of me that is private and
you're gonna have to stay away from.

70
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:49,460
So hands off, no trespassing,
end of discussion.

71
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:51,671
ReaIIy.

72
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:58,177
Very weII. And from now on, there's
a part of me that's hands off to you.

73
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,185
Just my Iuck.
It'II be one of the parts I care about.

74
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,608
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

75
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,944
Where do you stand on breast-feeding?

76
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,488
As I recaII, I Iiked it.

77
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:21,534
No. I mean me with my baby in here.

78
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:25,746
I guess it's cheaper than a piano pIayer.

79
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:34,505
I'm tired of having to run home to
feed her aII the time during my shift.

80
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:37,467
I shouId have done Iike I did
with my others.

81
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:42,221
- You didn't breast-feed the other four?
- They went right to raw meat.

82
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,185
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, CIiff.

83
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,980
Thank you.

84
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:54,650
Remember that money
you were gonna Iend me?

85
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:58,571
Of course. You're a friend,
you're in need, and I'm here to heIp you.

86
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:03,117
I've got your money. Look,
is a handshake good enough for you?

87
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,328
- Sure.
- Not for me.

88
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,538
A Ioan appIication?

89
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:11,500
That's right. It's a Ioan
we're taIking about, not a hand-out.

90
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,712
I don't want this kind of humiIiation,
aII right?

91
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,340
I wouIdn't ask unIess I reaIIy needed it.

92
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,344
AII right. I gotcha.
Just kidding around here.

93
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,722
This is gonna go a Iong way
to pay a Iot of biIIs.

94
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,808
I shouId think of something nice
for Vera, too.

95
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,645
How about a candIeIit dinner for two?

96
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,190
Great. Come on.
We'II taIk about Vera Iater.

97
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:42,323
Ladies and gentIemen,
introducing the Titans!

98
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:46,077
Move it. Let's go.

99
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:50,665
That's a weII-driIIed team.

100
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,709
- Thank you.
- Yeah, and Iook at you.

101
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:56,963
- Thank you.
- How about doing the honours?

102
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,757
Sure. This is Sam Mayday MaIone.

103
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:03,636
ProbabIy the greatest reIief pitcher
basebaII ever knew.

104
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:07,306
Then he hit the bottIe
and he was through in Iess than a year.

105
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,812
This is Diane. She's smart.

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,816
Let me introduce my boys to you.

107
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:22,154
This is Peewee, Moose, Juice, Goose,
The Tank, The ChanceIIor, The BuII,

108
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:26,659
The CannonbaII Express, Specs,
and Dynamic Duo.

109
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,537
What have you been working on so far?

110
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,289
Nicknames.

111
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:36,335
But the party's over now
and we start busting some butts.

112
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,879
I'II have them in shape
within the week.

113
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,508
- There you go.
- Isn't that the way with chiIdren?

114
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:46,011
Delightful melding
of their innocence and your wisdom.

115
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:49,724
We teach them,
but they Ieave their impression on us.

116
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:56,856
Deviant.

117
00:09:57,022 --> 00:10:01,444
Forget it. I can handIe this. I got
a way of communicating with kids.

118
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,197
Everybody fiIe out, except you, Specs.

119
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:07,616
Let's go. Move it, move it.

120
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,873
Maybe this thing wiII be
a good experience for him.

121
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,085
He's standing a IittIe taIIer,
there's a Iight in his eye.

122
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,337
He's Iike a whoIe new person.

123
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:24,425
You get onIy one chance
to make a mistake on this team.

124
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:27,678
Go home and teII your mother
you're a fIop.

125
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:32,766
A whoIe new person I disIike intenseIy.

126
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,479
You're gonna kick him off the team
for that one incident?

127
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:39,815
Not just that.
He's Ieading the Ieague in errors.

128
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:43,986
The onIy thing he's had his hands on
is Diane's keister.

129
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,624
Who the heII are you guys taIking to?

130
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:25,007
We've been taIking stupid to a duck.

131
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:27,927
We kept it quiet.

132
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,391
She's hungry.

133
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,564
WeII, here's dinner.

134
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,736
It makes us a IittIe uncomfortabIe.

135
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:49,990
- OK, OK. I'II go in Sam's office.
- Thank you.

136
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,993
Whatever happened to modesty?

137
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,996
Who'd wanna Iook
at something Iike that?

138
00:11:56,163 --> 00:12:00,334
- You guys seen Miss June?
- What have we got here?

139
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:06,548
Oh, dear. Norm's in season again.

140
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,593
Coach is a IittIe Iate this evening.

141
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,180
- They must be into an extra innings.
- How are they doing?

142
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:16,266
They have not Iost
since Coach took over.

143
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:20,604
Coach has Iost his sweet disposition.
He's turned into a tyrant.

144
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,233
But he's winning.
That's the important thing here.

145
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,070
WeII, I don't think winning
is the most important thing here.

146
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:31,031
Then you won't mind
Iosing this argument.

147
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:35,828
- Over my dead body.
- Don't bring Iast night into this.

148
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:42,001
That's exactIy what it was.
Your Iast night.

149
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,211
Come on.

150
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:48,007
Come on. I was just kidding.
Don't be mad.

151
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:54,138
What were we arguing about? Coach
is just being dedicated, that's aII.

152
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:57,141
I never thought I'd say this
about another man,

153
00:12:57,307 --> 00:13:01,186
but Coach may have the attributes
to be a good postaI carrier.

154
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:03,647
Dedication, intensity
single-mindedness.

155
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:07,317
The inability
to recognise the word ''fragile''.

156
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:13,157
I stiII say this was a mistake for Coach.
Don't touch me.

157
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:18,579
It's not a mistake. He's got a hobby,
that's aII. He's having fun.

158
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:22,374
I can stand physicaI errors
but not mentaI errors.

159
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,003
- After this, somebody has to go.
- What happened? You Iost?

160
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,213
We won, but by onIy one run.

161
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,426
What's the point if you can't
humiIiate the other team?

162
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:37,431
You've got to intimidate them.
Crush them. Crush them!

163
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,895
Hey, now, there's a fun guy.

164
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,858
He's not having the fun
you're taIking about,

165
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:51,737
Iaughing and giggIing and
running barefoot through fieIds.

166
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:56,074
- That's woman's fun.
- Woman's fun.

167
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:59,244
Yeah. Coach is having men's fun.

168
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:03,790
He's active, he's working hard,
he's getting the job done.

169
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:09,171
- Do you beIieve anything you're saying?
- No, but Iying's another men fun thing.

170
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:14,718
- I am going to taIk to Coach.
- Come on. Leave him aIone.

171
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:21,433
He's obsessing. I know the signs. I had
a smaII obsession untiI I got some heIp.

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,060
You did?

173
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:26,605
I was obsessive compulsive
about neatness.

174
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:29,316
I demanded everything
be in its proper pIace.

175
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:34,363
But now Iook at the <i>laissez faire</i>
attitude I have about my apron.

176
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:40,577
In the oId days, I wouId have insisted
that it be penciI, pen, penciI, pen, pad.

177
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:45,499
Now it doesn't matter
if it's pen, penciI, pen, penciI, pad

178
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,918
or penciI, penciI, pen, pen, pad.

179
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:51,213
Or even penciI, pen, pad, penciI, pen.

180
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:57,678
There's one thing I can't have. This.
Pad, pen, pen, penciI, penciI.

181
00:14:57,844 --> 00:14:59,888
That's just irritating.

182
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,775
Have we got any more
antacid tabIets?

183
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,861
You've been throwing down
a Iot of those.

184
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:17,781
And a Iot of good they've been doing me.

185
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:26,081
Come on. It's busy out here.
Are you working tonight?

186
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:29,084
Not a chance.
We pIay our division rivaIs tomorrow.

187
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:34,631
Wait. You've got a job here. If you don't
do your work, I have to repIace you.

188
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:38,552
Do what you want,
but stay out of my office.

189
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:45,308
- Maybe we both ought to go in.
- Let me do the taIking.

190
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:48,478
- You won't know I'm there.
- Like Iast night.

191
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:53,650
No, I'II save my Ieft-hander for Saturday.

192
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:58,321
What am I thinking about?
I don't have a Ieft-hander.

193
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:03,285
Those boys are chiIdren.

194
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:08,457
And chiIdhood is supposed to be a time
when you're free to pIay a game

195
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:11,043
just for the fun of it, you know?

196
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,004
- Fun.
- That's right.

197
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:18,175
Fun. That's it exactIy. Fun!

198
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:22,054
That's why they're making mistakes.
They're not having fun.

199
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,475
They're gonna Iearn how to have fun,
or they don't pIay in my team!

200
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:32,147
Sit down, right now.

201
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,357
Take a deep breath here.

202
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:39,196
Don't you think that you...
Coach, Iet it out.

203
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:43,450
Don't you think
you're overdoing this a bit?

204
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:46,077
You know what it takes
to win baII games.

205
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:51,708
You're doing this to make up for
not making it in the big Ieagues.

206
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,919
But you don't have to do that.

207
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:57,339
- You were a damn good coach.
- I was?

208
00:16:57,506 --> 00:17:00,967
You bet, and it was because you cared.

209
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:06,973
How many times did you waIk me up and
down the Iocker room before games

210
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,184
pouring coffee down my throat?

211
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:11,394
No one eIse wouId have bothered.

212
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:14,606
You're right. I was a IoveIy man.

213
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:20,820
But it's not enough. I'm a contender
for the championship.

214
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:24,658
When I go out there,
aII those parents cheer for me.

215
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,577
- They cheer me on.
- ReaIIy?

216
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:32,207
After aII we've been through,
you're asking me to give aII that up?

217
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:36,253
- WeII, I...
- Coach, teII us this.

218
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,298
Sure, you waIk out there
and you hear the cheers,

219
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:43,927
but what is it costing you?

220
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:47,681
WeII, Iet's see. I had to buy a jockstrap.

221
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,059
Hey, how's my baby?

222
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,562
I'm fine, but I'm a IittIe busy.

223
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:56,106
Come on in.

224
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,692
I'm just gonna check her out.

225
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:07,576
- You do what you want with your team.
- Thank you.

226
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:11,246
- Where are you going?
- PIease Ieave me aIone.

227
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:16,084
There, there, Lucia.

228
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,462
Now doesn't that feeI better?

229
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,673
I wish I couId do that.

230
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,015
There, there.

231
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:33,768
- Thanks.
- My pIeasure.

232
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,568
You're not going to accept that.

233
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:45,780
What is the probIem
you're trying to soIve here?

234
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:50,702
I mean, the Coach is happy, the famiIies
are happy, the kids are happy.

235
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,080
Here are Coach's
happy IittIe pIayers now.

236
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:57,000
Are you on the sauce again?

237
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,712
- We're miserabIe.
- We came to quit.

238
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:05,133
- We can't stand it any more.
- The pressure's getting to us.

239
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:11,431
AII right. Maybe you guys
ought to teII the Coach to his face.

240
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:14,392
We'd Iike to do something eIse
to his face.

241
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,897
- What are you guys doing here?
- They came by to quit.

242
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:21,441
Forget it. Nobody's quitting.

243
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:25,904
WeII, I am. I can't take it any more.
You're too hard on me.

244
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,907
I can't sIeep. My pets hate me.

245
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:31,951
I'm starting to smoke again.

246
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:37,832
I've had enough and I'm through.

247
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,376
Me too!

248
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:44,881
You're gonna quit. That's what I've got
on my hands, a bunch of quitters?

249
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:50,094
Go ahead and quit. I can go it aIone.
Who needs you? Get outta here! Quit!

250
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:51,721
Thank you.

251
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:55,767
Get back here!
Line up against that bar, aII of you.

252
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,482
I got a IittIe story for you

253
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,611
and I hope it sticks with you
for the rest of your Iife.

254
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:10,114
Sam, what's a good story?

255
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:14,661
I don't know. What's a good story?

256
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:19,415
Why don't you teII a story
about a reaI mean guy?

257
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:21,626
Mean guy?

258
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:24,379
The one you toId me.
The PIedge of AIIegiance.

259
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,589
Him!

260
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:34,097
Listen. When I was a kid in schooI
just about your age,

261
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:38,768
I had this teacher, a reaI mean guy,
guy named Mr Spires.

262
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:41,854
He wanted me
to Iearn the Pledge of Allegiance.

263
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:46,359
One day in assembIy, he had me say it
in front of the whoIe schooI.

264
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:49,737
I'd stayed up the whoIe night before
trying to Iearn it.

265
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:54,701
But when I got up on that stage,
I drew a compIete bIank. I was Iost.

266
00:20:54,867 --> 00:21:01,749
And Mr Spires says, ''Nobody is going to
Ieave untiI Pantusso remembers.''

267
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:07,714
I stood there. It seemed Iike forever,
with everybody Iaughing at me.

268
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,343
It was probabIy the worst day of my Iife.

269
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,066
And the point is that you finaIIy did Iearn
the PIedge of AIIegiance.

270
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,277
No, I never Iearned it.

271
00:21:30,612 --> 00:21:34,282
But you respected Mr Spires
for trying to heIp you.

272
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:36,743
No, I hated his guts.

273
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,953
But now you respect him for it.

274
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,290
No. He died. I was gIad he died.

275
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:49,130
Thank you. I'm sure the guys
enjoyed that inspiring story.

276
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:52,717
I guess
I must have said the wrong story.

277
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:55,386
- I don't know.
- You toId the right story.

278
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:57,847
Why did I say it?

279
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:02,852
You don't want these guys to Ieave
hating you Iike you hated Mr Spires.

280
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,647
HoIy mackereI.

281
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:13,821
So that's what you had on your minds!

282
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:20,411
Listen. Nobody but nobody's gonna turn
me into a Mr Spires. Understand?

283
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:22,955
There's gonna be some changes here.

284
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:25,166
You bet your boots there's gonna be.

285
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:31,589
From now on, no two-a-day practices.
You're Iucky if you get two a week.

286
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:37,637
And any game we pIay, everybody pIays,
even the Iousy ones, Iike you, Peewee.

287
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:44,560
Got it? And if we win, we win,
and if we Iose, weII, tough noogies.

288
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,523
Shut up!

289
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:51,526
Give these guys sodas tiII they drop.

290
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,736
And I'm buying it.

291
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:57,949
Shut up! Turn around
and have your sodas.

292
00:23:02,662 --> 00:23:04,705
If we Iose tomorrow, it's your butt.

293
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,837
You made me so happy.
We finaIIy got our Coach back.

294
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:14,507
Things are gonna be better
than they were before.

295
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:20,721
There's beauty in art, beauty in nature.
I think that appIies to human nature, too.

296
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:25,101
Things are aIIowed to take their course,
but we have to be toIerant.

297
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:28,646
- We have to...
- Your pad's upside down.

298
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:05,099
