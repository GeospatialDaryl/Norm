1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,797
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,637
It was your fault we lost that contest.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,075
- It was not my fault.
- We'll find out whose fault it was.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,674
- "Heart of My Heart" from the top.
- All right, sing it.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,195
Heart of my heart

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,511
- I love that melody
- Love that melody

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,592
Heart of my heart
Brings back...

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,149
Right there! That's the note
that cost us the championship.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,596
Oh, yeah? Well, that remark
just cost you a bass!

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,197
Hey, wait a minute, Jim. Now we
gotta find ourselves another bass.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,349
Three beers.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,953
You know, I love barbershop quartets.
You mind if I make a little request?

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,155
Not at all.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,676
Could you give me
a little trim around the ears later?

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,879
Excuse me, fellas. I couldn't
help overhearing what happened.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,032
It's always been a lifelong dream of
mine to sing in a barbershop quartet.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,713
I wonder if you might give me a try?

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,228
Why not?
"Good Night, Ladies" okay?

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,358
Yeah "Good Night, Ladies."
All right. All right.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,992
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,990
Good night, ladies
We're going to leave you now

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,633
- That was fantastic!
- Hey, we got ourselves a new bass!

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,634
Yeah, well, no. You know, I'm really
flattered, fellas, but I don't think so.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,553
You said it was your lifelong dream
to sing in a barbershop quartet.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,996
Well, it was and now I've done it.
Thanks for the memories.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,190
The farmer in the dell
The farmer in the dell

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,790
Hey, everybody, howdy-doody.

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,758
- Guess what I got in the bag.
- What's left of your mind?

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,918
Ladies and gentlemen,

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,153
I'd like to introduce a turnip
that needs no introduction:

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,071
Miss June Lockhart.

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,675
Hey, look here.

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,356
You put a little makeup on her.
Shampoo and set her root hairs.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,710
Finish her off with a delicate
strand of pearls...

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,878
Is it me or is this
getting a little weird?

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,950
You passed weird six months ago.

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,078
Now you're boldly going
where no man has gone before.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,236
Boy, I guess it's true
what they say, huh?

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,839
It's a fine line between
gardening and madness.

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,199
Cliff, old man...

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,670
...maybe a little vacation
would do you some good.

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,513
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back to my office.

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,274
Hey, doc? Doc, listen,
you mind if I tag along with you?

44
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,000
Just for the stroll, you know,
a little informal chat on the way?

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,639
You bet, Cliff.
I'd enjoy the company.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,995
Well, yeah, good.
Listen, I'm a very private man.

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,391
I've gotta warn you at the outset. I just
don't bare my soul at the drop of a hat.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,754
Oh, I understand.

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,515
Yeah, I was breast-fed a lot
longer than most youngsters.

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,238
I mean, babies.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,319
Hey, everybody.

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,040
Oh, hey, Sam. I thought
you weren't coming in till 5.

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,112
Oh, well, I had to pick up some stuff.
We're gonna play some racquetball.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,111
Oh, Bonnie, Woody. Woody, Bonnie.

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,635
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you all right?

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,789
So where you guys been?

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,349
Oh, we spent the afternoon
at Bonnie's apartment listening to

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,990
the latest album of
John Cougar Mellen...something.

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,277
- Mellencamp. Yeah, he's great.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

60
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,158
So, what rock groups
you like, Bonnie?

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,154
Let's see. I like the Thompson Twins,
Tears for Fears, U2.

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,753
- Oh, I love U2.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,070
Yeah, we look great together,
don't we?

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,993
Hey, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get my equipment.

65
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,593
- Pretty girl, Sam.
- Yeah. Thank you.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,469
Be careful she doesn't lose
a baby tooth giving you a hickey.

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,519
What's that crack supposed to mean?
She young or something?

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,353
Well, you must admit, there's
a bit of a gap between your ages.

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,478
Oh, yeah? She's a very
sophisticated woman,

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,393
and she has travelled extensively.
She's been to Hawaii.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,989
Boy, I envy Sammy

72
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,230
- his carefree lifestyle.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,118
Night after night,
he dates pretty girls,

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,874
while I sit here
and wrestle with the world's problems.

75
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,359
You do not.

76
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,078
What do you mean?
Last night, I let out that moan

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,912
at the thought of nuclear war.

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,918
It wasn't because of nuclear war.

79
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,310
It was because we ran out
of beer nuts.

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,716
It was a combination of the two.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,593
- Y'all set?
- Oh, yeah.

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,877
You know, Sam, Woody's
a really rad guy.

83
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,077
Well, you know my motto:
"Hire the rad."

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,233
Wait a second, here, let me get
some money. I'll be right back.

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,389
Hey, have a good game.

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,118
Thanks, Woody.
I'll see you Saturday?

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,396
Saturday?
What's happening Saturday?

88
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,632
Oh, Saturday, Woody and l,
we're gonna play racquetball.

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,995
I didn't know you played racquetball.

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,354
Yeah, I play a little.

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,711
Why didn't you tell me?

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,111
Well, I didn't think
the two of us should play.

93
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,150
Well, why not?
Oh, come on, man,

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,912
just because I'm
a professional athlete?

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,957
No, it wasn't that.
It was more because you're a little...

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680
I mean, you're a few years...

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,160
Yeah, it's because you're
a professional athlete.

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,309
No, it wasn't. It's because
you think I was old, maybe.

99
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,029
Oh, no, no, not old, Sam.
Just older.

100
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,277
You wanna take me on,
you little guy, you?

101
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,795
Sure, I'd like that.

102
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,837
All right. Carla, you wanna
tend the bar here?

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,115
Got it.

104
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,592
Sam, has it occurred to you that you
challenged Woody to a contest

105
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,832
because he threatened
your relationship with Bonnie?

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,675
No. But has this occurred to you:
Leave me alone.

107
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,519
You all set, man?

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,273
- Sure am.
- Great.

109
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,634
Great.

110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,790
Oh, hey, is that somebody
famous up...?

111
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,509
Oh, I guess not.
I'm sorry. My mistake.

112
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,318
Okay, we're off here, huh?

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,754
You're not too tired to work behind
the bar now, are you, Woody?

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,797
- I can take over if you are.
- No, I'm fine.

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,394
Sam, are you limping?

116
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,152
I don't know.
Let me take a look here.

117
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,515
Oh, by golly, look at that.
It must be these new shoes.

118
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,592
- Who won?
- Sam did.

119
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,749
Yeah.

120
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,956
You should have seen him out there.
He was great!

121
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,236
You know, I especially liked
that last shot you made

122
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
diving across the court.
And that little scream you let out?

123
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,832
Oh, that's my victory scream.
I always do that when I win.

124
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,396
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, why?

125
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,039
Your upper lip is sweating profusely.

126
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,760
I just played racquetball.
People sweat when they do that.

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,592
On their lips?

128
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,478
Didn't you take
a shower afterwards?

129
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,189
Of course I did.
Maybe I just forgot to dry my lip.

130
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,676
Does Sam's behaviour
give you pause?

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,752
Methinks the man does
protest too much.

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,073
Excuse me, Miss Chambers,
but shouldn't it be "l thinks"?

133
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,918
Not in your case, Woody.

134
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,916
What's with the skis, Sam?

135
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,640
Oh, all this physical activity's
put me in a physical mood.

136
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,472
I feel like doing
something else physical.

137
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,596
I think I'm gonna go
skiing for a while.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,752
If you need help behind the bar,
Woody, call Bob.

139
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,353
Sam, this is all rather sudden.
Where are you going?

140
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,953
How long will you be gone?

141
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,715
Sugarloaf, Maine. If the snow's cold
and the women hot,

142
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,474
I'll be gone forever.
See you guys. Bye-bye.

143
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,832
What a guy!

144
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,714
We just get through playing
a hard game of racquetball

145
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,199
and he's still raring to go.

146
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,430
You just never know
what he's gonna do next.

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,194
Like now, for example.

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,675
Are you absolutely sure?

149
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,552
Thank you.

150
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,358
Oh, dear me, my worst fears
are confirmed.

151
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,915
There's been a peroxide embargo?

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,071
This is no time for levity. I just called
every hotel in Sugarloaf,

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,390
and there's no Sam Malone
registered anywhere.

154
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,796
Maybe he's staying under
an assumed name.

155
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,350
No, I checked all the assumed
names he usually uses.

156
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,954
There's no Lance Manion.

157
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,751
Nor is there a Honeyboy Wilson.

158
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,909
Hi, everybody.

159
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,596
Hey, doc, I really gotta hand it to you
for that job you did on Cliffie.

160
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,116
He's really been in good spirits lately
and rarely discusses vegetables.

161
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,317
Yeah, it seems our little impromptu
session's been quite beneficial.

162
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,710
You know, for my part,
I hope to get an article published

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,474
in either Psychology Today
or the Burpee Seed Catalogue.

164
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,359
No, seriously, it's always very gratifying
to help another human being.

165
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,230
Hey, Sigmund Fraud.

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,518
Are you addressing me, Cliff?

167
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,071
This bill is outrageous,
750 bucks here for a friendly chat.

168
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,835
I've had several of Ma's organs
taken out for less than that.

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,913
It was not a little chat. It was seven
hours of intensive psychotherapy,

170
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,913
which I flatter myself to say
has done you a world of good.

171
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,433
Oh, yeah? You think so?

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,229
Yeah, well, I don't think so.
And neither does Meryl Streep!

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,752
- Are you ladies ready for a check?
- Yes, thank you.

174
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,878
Anyway, I've been at Boston Mercy
for five years,

175
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,077
and I have never had a more
relentless patient than I had today.

176
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,550
Even when he was in constant pain,
he never stopped coming on to me.

177
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,756
My God, it's Sam!

178
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,949
Are you all right?

179
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,399
The patient you're talking about.
Is it by any chance Sam Malone?

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,233
- No.
- Thank God.

181
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,436
His name is Lance Manion.

182
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,360
Oh, yeah, thank you.

183
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,476
Certainly. Is there
anything else I can get?

184
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,278
Yeah. Naked.

185
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,475
Actually, I don't think
I could handle it today.

186
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,519
Boy, these hernias
always hurt so bad?

187
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,114
Oh, just for a few days.

188
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,111
Well, if you need anything else,
just ring.

189
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,268
Thank you. Oh, God...

190
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,955
Sam?

191
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,513
Hey, boy, what a coincidence!
Just donated a pint of blood.

192
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,274
The volunteer will be back.

193
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,830
Just have a seat here and... Hey,
bless your heart for giving, really...

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,956
I know why you're here.

195
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,871
As luck would have it, a couple
of nurses stopped by the bar.

196
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,474
They had your fingerprints
all over them.

197
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,118
I see.

198
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,068
In that case, you don't mind
if I sit down, do you?

199
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,754
From this angle, it's preferable.

200
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,679
Sam, I know what this is all about.

201
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,150
Dating young girls.
Nearly killing yourself to beat Woody.

202
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,958
Not telling us you were
in the hospital.

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
No, I didn't tell you
I was in the hospital...

204
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,913
...because I got a hernia,
and it's an old man's problem,

205
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,799
and I didn't want the guys
to make fun of me. That's all.

206
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,313
First of all...

207
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,674
...people of all ages get hernias.

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,314
Second of all...

209
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,513
...getting older is the most
natural thing in the world.

210
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,319
There's nothing to fear. Accept it.

211
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,232
I will not accept it!

212
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,473
Listen, the day you start accepting
getting old is the day you get old.

213
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,950
- All right, Sam. Have it your way.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,475
But I think you'd be much
happier and content

215
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,633
if instead of fighting the advancing
years, you embrace them joyfully.

216
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,472
No.

217
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,513
Hi, how you doing today?

218
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,150
- Great, as a matter of fact. Thank you.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

219
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,392
- Diane?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,675
Diane Chambers?

221
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,995
Yes, that's right.

222
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,674
Don't you remember me?
Steve McDunna.

223
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,035
You tutored me for a while
when I was in junior high.

224
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,357
Stevie McDunna? Little Stevie?

225
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,832
Little Dr Steve...
Big little Dr Stevie?

226
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,508
Yes, yeah. It's very nice
to see you again.

227
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,955
I'm sorry, I have to run.
I'll check in with you later.

228
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,189
Yeah, bye-bye.

229
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,953
I'm old and alone in Boston.

230
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,917
Sammy's back!

231
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,314
Sam, what are you doing back here?

232
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,756
You should be in for at least
another week. Dr Stevie said so.

233
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,797
I got me a second opinion. My own.

234
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,473
I'm as healthy as an ox.

235
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,030
Hey, good to have you back,
Sammy, my man!

236
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,953
- Can't keep a good man down, huh?
- Yeah, no, it's good to be back.

237
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,031
Now don't encourage him.
He's rushing things.

238
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,509
- Good to have you back, Sammy.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

239
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,352
Carla, could you cover
the bar a second?

240
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,158
I'm just gonna grab
a case of Bass Ale.

241
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,118
Oh, hey, hold on there, young fella.
I'll get that. I'll get that.

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,589
Don't be stupid, Sammy.
You just had an operation.

243
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,309
Hey, the day that I can't pick up a case
of beer is the day that I sell this place.

244
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,550
Sam, what are you trying to prove?

245
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,429
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to run a bar here.

246
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,637
Not too shabby, huh?

247
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,832
- Nice going, Sammy.
- Yeah.

248
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,073
Sam?

249
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,994
Do you wanna go back
to the hospital?

250
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,039
Very badly.

251
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,557
No, I can do it. I can do it.

252
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,796
Welcome back, Valentino.

253
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,389
Hey, that's the first time

254
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,915
you didn't accidentally check
the starch in my whites.

255
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,073
Oh, yeah, about that,
I'm sorry if I got fresh.

256
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,719
Don't apologize.

257
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,111
We nurses didn't cut the ties off
the back of your gown for nothing.

258
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,749
Company's coming!

259
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,596
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do this.

260
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,751
I know you didn't.
That's all right. It's okay.

261
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,150
He's been like this
ever since you left, Sam.

262
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,675
Sam, l... I've come to donate
an organ or something.

263
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,951
Woody, Woody, I have a hernia.

264
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,714
Well, if you need another one,
take mine.

265
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,115
Well, thank you. Thank you, man.

266
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,840
Hey, thanks for coming down.
I really appreciate that.

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,594
You... You're depressing
the hell out of me.

268
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,591
It may be better
if you took off. Yeah?

269
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,113
You got it, Sam.

270
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,794
- I'll see you.
- All right. Bye-bye.

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,718
Here you go, Sam.

272
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,759
I want you to have that.
It's kind of a family heirloom.

273
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,676
- What is it?
- A truss.

274
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,994
It came over with my grandfather
from the old country.

275
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,355
Actually, it came over
on my grandfather.

276
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,713
Oh, well, yeah, gee,
that's nice. Thank you.

277
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,599
It's a joke! You don't need this thing.

278
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,877
You're Sammy.
Sammy don't wear no truss. Geez!

279
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,678
Oh, that's funny. That's very funny.

280
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,831
Yeah, well, don't pop
your stitches laughing.

281
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,074
I'm sorry. It's just this stupid hernia
thing's getting me feeling my age.

282
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,314
What are you talking about?
Would you stop that?

283
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,277
Sam Malone never ages.

284
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,271
It's one of life's great truths.

285
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,396
Let me tell you something,
Sammy.

286
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,632
When you're 87,
you'll still be a hunk to me.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,070
Of course, I'll be senile and blind.

288
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,079
- And pregnant.
- Yeah, probably.

289
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,073
- I'll look you up.
- You better.

290
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,831
Fun's over.
See you around, Sam.

291
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,752
Thank you, Carla.

292
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,955
Bye, Carla.

293
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,510
You see? There are other parts to a
hospital besides the maternity ward.

294
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,113
Bite it.

295
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,797
Hi, Sam. How are you?

296
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,111
I don't even know why you bother
asking. You know how I am. I'm old.

297
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,999
- Sam, please.
- No, no, no, you were right.

298
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,195
You know, I tried denying it,
but it's no use.

299
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,150
All I got to look forward to
is slowing down, wearing out,

300
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,992
and breaking the occasional hip.

301
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,230
Oh, Sam!

302
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,597
Oh, I can't stand to hear you
talk like that. You were right.

303
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,435
I was wrong. You can't just lie back
and accept getting old.

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,319
You have to live each day
to the fullest.

305
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,596
I don't know. It's...

306
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,750
No, really, I mean it.

307
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,675
Besides, you men get better looking
the older that you get.

308
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,796
Look at this guy.

309
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,632
Huh?

310
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,199
Strong.

311
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,759
Vital.

312
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,273
Sexy.

313
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,476
Isn't he something?

314
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,638
You really think
I'm better looking now?

315
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,874
You're a much more attractive man
than when I first met you. Much more.

316
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,912
And there's no telling
what you may yet achieve.

317
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,230
I went to the library today,

318
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,632
and I found a book
that contains a list of people

319
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,713
who made contributions
well into their latter years.

320
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,393
Listen to this:

321
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,552
Leo Tolstoy, Albert Schweitzer,

322
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,589
Grandma Moses, Bertrand Russell,
Picasso, Goethe...

323
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,311
- Oh, now, he's my favourite.
- Yeah, mine too. Mine too. He...

324
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,551
What are you doing?

325
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,439
Well, I just thought I'd make the room
look a little more romantic.

326
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,955
You keep reading.
You go right ahead.

327
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh, Sam, this is wonderful.

328
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
An old person wouldn't be doing this.

329
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,754
This is the act of a vital,
strong, young man.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,353
Who wants a woman.

331
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,149
Who wants sex.
Who won't get it.

332
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,797
But this is a very positive sign.

333
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,155
Ah, hey, come on, you know.

334
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,438
This is a chance of a lifetime
to play doctor in a real hospital.

335
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,589
Now come on.

336
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,830
It's tempting, it's tempting,
but I think not.

337
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,436
I'm going to go now and let you rest.

338
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,034
Yeah. Hey, listen.

339
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,915
I don't want you to make
too big a deal out of this,

340
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,479
but thank you very much for coming.

341
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,234
Your visit helped a lot today.

342
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,710
Well, if we can't reach out
in our moment of need, if we can't

343
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,555
span the gap that separates
each human. If we can't allow...

344
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,030
Sweetheart, sweetheart, that's what
I meant by making too big a deal.

345
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,154
- Okay. Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye-bye.

346
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,039
Hi.

347
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,149
- Howdy.
- Hi.

348
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,356
Thanks, I can handle it.

349
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,195
- I'm Jack Turner, your new roomie.
- Sam Malone. How you doing?

350
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,634
Great.

351
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,272
Hey, Sam Malone.
You're the baseball player, aren't you?

352
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,714
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

353
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,677
Yeah, so what are you in for?

354
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,273
Hernia.

355
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,109
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

356
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,396
Yeah, I had one of those
a couple of years ago.

357
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,110
- Didn't slow me down a bit.
- Yeah? Is that right? Really?

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,430
Well, you and I are about
the same age, aren't we?

359
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,113
Yeah, sure.

360
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,356
Well, what are you back here for?

361
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,713
Bone spur.

362
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,996
Yeah. Sam Malone.

363
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,229
I remember seeing you
out at Fenway.

364
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,758
Yeah. Well, it looks like you've
taken pretty good care of yourself.

365
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,435
Yeah, I work at it. You're not
looking too shabby there yourself.

366
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,155
I can do more pushups now
than when I was 20.

367
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,356
Hey, me too, you know.
Me too. Really.

368
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,353
As a matter of fact,
I haven't felt better in my entire life.

369
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,592
You know, they say a man reaches
his sexual peak at 1 8.

370
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,517
Bet some 1 8-year-old
said that, huh?

371
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,314
Yeah, the nurses cut the ties
on my gown here.

372
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,199
- Get out of here!
- No, I'm not kidding!

373
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,878
- Hey, here's my gal now.
- Oh, well.

374
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,393
Hey, Judy.

375
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,599
Judy, I want you to meet Sam Malone.
Isn't she something, Sam?

376
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,557
Sure is. Listen, if you ever
wanna dump him,

377
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,234
you can make a house call
on Sammy here anytime you want.

378
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,994
Hey, Sam, this is my daughter
you're talking to.

379
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,678
Your daughter, really?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

380
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,548
It's all right. Come on, honey,
let's take a look around, huh?

381
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,439
Nice to meet you, sir.
