00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,051
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,487
And I look up and I say,

3
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:07,922
"It will never do,
it will never do."

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,524
I just cannot believe...

5
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,942
Normie.
Huh?

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,311
Normie, it's the Kennedys.

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,096
Let's go tell the
guys downstairs. No, no, no,

8
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,164
I've got a camera with me.

9
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:17,332
Here, quick, get a snapshot.

10
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,433
I'll... I'll pretend
I'm with them.

11
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:19,824
I'll be nonchalant, okay?

12
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,641
Oh, would you guys
like a picture?

13
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:28,109
Oh, that would be great-
do you mind?

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,527
No, no.
You sure you don't mind?

15
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,595
Great, thank you.

16
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:31,712
Thank you.
Okay.

17
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,364
(chuckling)

18
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,734
That's great.
All right.

19
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:36,785
Thank you so much.

20
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,019
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

21
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,590
Nice to see you.
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:40,705
Bye.
Yeah.

23
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:41,806
Bye-bye.
All right!

24
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,024
Hey!

Hey.
What you doing?

42
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:06,987
I'm, uh, writing
a little letter here

43
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,692
to that Russian cosmonaut
who's stranded

44
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,628
in the space station up there.

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,430
How are you gonna get it to him?

46
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:19,087
(phone ringing)
WOODY: Cheers.

47
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,522
Hi, honey.

48
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,692
Oh, now, let's not
go through this again.

49
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,293
I thought we already
had it decided.

50
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:27,495
We're gonna stay
in my apartment.

51
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,497
Well, how do you know
you don't like it?

52
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:31,399
You haven't seen it yet.

53
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,903
Trust me, Kelly, you're gonna
come to love Chinatown.

54
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:37,371
Now... now,
don't forget,

55
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,907
our place is the one
right next to the shop

56
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:43,478
with the beheaded ducks
draining in the window.

57
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,313
Well, I love you, too.

58
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,481
Bye-bye.

59
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,082
(smacks lips)

60
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,851
What was that all about?

61
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,187
Well, uh, since our
wedding, Kelly and I

62
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,845
have been living in one of
the Gaines' guest houses.

63
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,858
Now she wants to get
a house of our own,

64
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,361
but I can't afford
it, so I think

65
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,263
we should just live
in my old apartment.

66
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,997
You kept your apartment
the whole time?

67
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:03,982
Well, I kind of had to.

68
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,484
I have a
ten-year lease.

69
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,605
How did you get stuck
with a ten-year lease?

70
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:13,324
I had to do some
pretty fancy talking.

71
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,744
I save ten bucks a month.

72
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,846
That's money in my pocket.

73
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:19,931
Let me ask you something.

74
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,433
You-you think Kelly's
gonna be happy

75
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,734
in that little place of yours?

76
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,986
Well, what does it matter?

77
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,822
I'm the husband-
I call the shots.

78
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,458
Isn't that rather
sexist, Woody?

79
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:31,826
Well you've got to understand.

80
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:33,094
That's how I was brought up.

81
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,462
Back in Hanover,

82
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:37,065
the man is the king
of the castle.

83
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,366
When he gives an order,

84
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:41,336
all his wives have to listen.

85
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:44,005
Wives, Woody?

86
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,123
Wife.

87
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,242
I said wife-
singular.

88
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,111
(laughing):
I mean, the thought that a man

89
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:53,013
could have more than one wife,
that's preposterous.

90
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,097
I mean, I...
not to mention illegal.

91
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,485
I know that.

92
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:01,122
So do all the citizens
of Hanover.

93
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,561
Anybody else curious
about Hanover?

94
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,379
Come on, Norm,
I'm sure it's just a...

95
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,549
a normal, rural, small,
little farm town.

96
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:14,785
I'm sure Woody's stories
are all greatly exaggerated.

97
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,070
Want to go there?

98
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,608
What, end up as a
human sacrifice to the corn god?

99
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,158
Thank you, no.

100
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:28,183
Ooh, nobody told me
the fleet was in.

101
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,487
So... what can
I get you,

102
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,024
you silver-haired
boy toy?

103
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,830
I'm looking for Rebecca Howe.

104
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,865
Why do you want hamburger

105
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,666
when you can have fillet mignon?

106
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,071
She's my daughter.

107
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,508
Ooh.

108
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,412
Excuse me, uh...

109
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,982
Hi there, I'm sorry.

110
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:02,249
Uh, did I hear you right,

111
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,485
that you're
Rebecca Howe's father?

112
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:04,652
That's right.

113
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:06,855
Captain Franklin E. Howe,
United States Navy.

114
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:08,289
Oh, I'm Sam Malone.

115
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,108
You know, maybe
she mentioned me to you.

116
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,979
Yes, you're the
bright young fellow

117
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,961
who tried to have a
baby with my daughter

118
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:15,830
without the sanctity
of wedlock.

119
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,167
So, my name came up then.

120
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,468
I have just one
question for you.

121
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,438
What the hell were
you thinking, boy?

122
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:27,008
What the hell were
you thinking?

123
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,745
Um, well, we
were both thinking, sir,

124
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:32,947
that, you know, because
we're such good friends...

125
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:34,749
we weren't in love,
yes, that's true,

126
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,884
but we thought maybe
we could be a, you know,

127
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:38,420
mommy and a daddy
without the commitment

128
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,188
and the other stuff.
I know...

129
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,173
I know saying this right now
sounds kind of...

130
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,708
even to me, it sounds...

131
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,910
Is it hot in here
or is it just me?

132
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,114
Daddy.

133
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,567
Daddy, what are you doing here?

134
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:55,269
I just wanted to see
my little Pookie. Oh!

135
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:57,054
(Rebecca giggling)

136
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,040
Everybody, I want you
to meet my father.

137
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,025
You can just call him Brig-
that's his nickname.

138
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,076
They call him Brig

139
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,345
because he put
so many sailors in jail.

140
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,314
Then, why don't
they call me Brig?

141
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:11,152
Daddy, over here.

142
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,022
Daddy, I'm so surprised
to see you.

143
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,757
Is anything wrong?

144
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,525
Well, to tell you
the truth, Pookie,

145
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,193
your mother and I
became a little concerned

146
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:20,895
when we received
your last postcard.

147
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,580
Well, why?
It said,

148
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,082
"Having a wonderful time.

149
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,816
Wish I were dead."

150
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:28,602
Daddy, why don't you
just sit here, and I'll get us

151
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,788
a couple of beers or something.

152
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,957
Everybody, psst, psst,
come here, come here.

153
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,959
Listen, I need your help.

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,961
Listen, my... my dad
can be kind of critical,

155
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:40,198
so let's not go into some
of the dumber things

156
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,899
that I've done while
I've worked here.

157
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,202
Well, what are we gonna
talk to him about?

158
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,337
I don't know.

159
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,738
You could talk to
him about anything.

160
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,772
Talk to him about the weather.

161
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:50,507
Just... my dad
sort of thinks

162
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,109
that I'm some sort of screw up.

163
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,261
ALL:
No!

164
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,230
Very funny.

165
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:59,033
It all started when my dad
took me as a little girl

166
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:02,036
on a tour of his aircraft
carrier, and I...

167
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:04,272
well, to make a long
story short, I...

168
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,841
I shot something off the boat.

169
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:11,462
One international incident,
and I am branded for life.

170
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:14,215
Anyway, I just...
it's just very important

171
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:16,083
that he thinks that I know
what I'm doing,

172
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,618
so let... let's not
bring things up

173
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,237
like losing the liquor license

174
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,304
or, uh... or
the flood.

175
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,840
And God forbid, do
not mention the fire.

176
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:26,561
She lost the liquor license,

177
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,863
and then she flooded the place?

178
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,116
That's not the capper.

179
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,173
(chuckling):
Then, she burned it down.

180
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:39,724
Oh, Pookie.

181
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,659
You burned down the bar.

182
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,629
I know, I was gonna tell you,
but I thought you'd be mad.

183
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,930
I see.

184
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:49,133
It's the playroom incident
all over again.

185
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,502
Pookie, I'm very
concerned about you.

186
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,087
I mean, let's review.

187
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,623
Oh, no, Daddy,
let's not review.

188
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,891
In the past year,

189
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,209
you tried to have a baby

190
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,711
with a man
you weren't married to,

191
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:02,330
you burned down
your place of business,

192
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,832
and now, according
to your last letter,

193
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,869
you want another raise
in your allowance.

194
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,773
Uh, excuse me,
did you just say,

195
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,441
"a raise in her allowance"?

196
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,243
No, he did not say,
"raise in allowance".

197
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,294
He said...

198
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,632
"That old, lazy Jack Palance."

199
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,117
Daddy,

200
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:24,952
what say we go have some lunch?

201
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:25,737
Come on.

202
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,054
Let's talk about the family.

203
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,055
How is Susan doing?

204
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:29,357
Oh, your sister is fine.

205
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,359
She got a raise
and a promotion.

206
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:33,260
That bitch.

207
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,145
CARLA:
Hey, guys.

208
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,581
Guys, guess what grown-up
bar manager

209
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,417
is still getting an allowance
from her Navy dad.

210
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:41,668
Who?

211
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,487
SAM:
An allowance, huh?

212
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,123
That explains how she
can afford a fancy car

213
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,758
and that apartment of hers.

214
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,043
Boy, imagine somebody getting

215
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:50,978
an allowance at her age, huh?

216
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,481
My ma cut me off when I was 30.

217
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,269
No ifs, ands or buts,
and it hurt, I tell you.

218
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,537
Hurt like hell.

219
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,639
Oh, but it had a happy ending.

220
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,474
Made you more self-reliant,
Cliffie?

221
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:06,711
Nah, nah, a couple years later,
her pension fund went bankrupt.

222
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,047
She had to come crawling to me
for some dough.

223
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,683
Yeah, I just gave her
the old horse laugh.

224
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,685
What goes around, huh, boys?

225
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,090
It's got to be just so
demeaning, you know?

226
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,658
You're living your
life on the dole

227
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,393
the whole time...
take, take, take.

228
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,790
You want that on your tab?

229
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,029
Yeah, please.

230
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,700
How can she look at herself
in the mirror?

231
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,141
I would die of embarrassment.

232
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,663
How was lunch, sweetheart?

233
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,081
It was terrific.

234
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,184
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to be afraid of my dad

235
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,020
'cause he was sort of pushy
and overbearing,

236
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,989
but I'll tell you, we have
really learned to communicate.

237
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,391
It's just like two adults,
one on one.

238
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,193
CARLA:
You mean like one adult

239
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:58,729
asks the other one for a raise
in their allowance,

240
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,864
and the other adult
says, "Okay, Pookie"?

241
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:01,999
(chuckling)

242
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,352
Very, very funny, Carla.

243
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,053
Now, now, now,
let's not all jump

244
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,254
down Rebecca's throat.

245
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,672
I received a stipend
from my father for a time,

246
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:12,226
a little out-of-pocket money
to spend as I saw fit

247
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,028
on entertainment,
what have you.

248
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,212
So, you see, I've been through

249
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,314
exactly what Rebecca's
going through right now.

250
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,100
Thank you, Frasier.

251
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,035
And then, I turned 11.

252
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:27,858
Hi, Woody.
Oh, hi, honey.

253
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,277
Did you find the apartment?

254
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,395
Yes, Mr. Smarty-Pants,
I found it.

255
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,730
Very funny.

256
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,899
Now, where's
your real apartment?

257
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,668
What are you talking about?

258
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,771
Woody, the place
you gave me directions to

259
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,473
was this stinky little room
with bars on the window

260
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,109
and an old Farrah Fawcett
poster on the wall.

261
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,912
Hey, I'm married, not dead.

262
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,547
KELLY:
Woody,

263
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,167
please let my family
buy us a house.

264
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,236
Don't make me go back
to that place.

265
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,443
Kelly, that's our home.

266
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:57,655
That's all I can afford,

267
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,023
and that's where
we're gonna live.

268
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,190
(sighs)

269
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,859
Well, Mr.
"No wife of mine

270
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,561
"will have her family
buy us a house

271
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,429
even if we have to live
like peasants" Boyd,

272
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,864
if you insist,

273
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,766
then I guess I have no choice.

274
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,518
Well, first of all,
that's not my name.

275
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,289
And second of all, I do insist.

276
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:18,425
Fine, I'll move my furniture in

277
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:20,360
first thing this afternoon.

278
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,346
I have to tell you, Woody Boyd,

279
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,044
this is the worst day
of my life,

280
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,117
and I wish I was dead.

281
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,652
Bye, everybody.

282
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:33,858
Oh.

283
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,860
Thank you.

284
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:46,420
Hey, pretty boy!

285
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,671
Where's my daughter?

286
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,269
Well, she's in the office.
You want me to go get her?

287
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:54,712
No, Woody, I think
he was talking to me.

288
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,213
(chuckles):
Oh, right.

289
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,781
Maybe a few years ago.

290
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,403
God, this place makes me sick.

291
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,272
Bunch of indolent do-nothings

292
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,207
sitting around
on their fat cans.

293
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:10,461
You know, if you squint
really hard, it could be Vera.

294
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,714
You know, I happen to agree

295
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,583
with you there, Captain.

296
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,587
But then again, uh, we men of
uniform tend to think alike.

297
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:25,326
That's not a uniform,
that's a costume.

298
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,763
Doesn't become a uniform
till you strap on a side arm.

299
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,498
You ever done that, son?

300
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,501
Some days, when I'm
feeling jittery.

301
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:37,204
REBECCA:
Oh, Daddy.

302
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:39,006
You're back.

303
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:41,842
Pookie, I've been
doing some thinking.

304
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,210
We've got to talk.

305
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,278
Sit down.

306
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,512
Not another review.

307
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:46,580
Yes.

308
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:47,581
Another review.

309
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:51,085
Princess, we have
a situation here.

310
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,538
Now, I've butted out
of your life for 39 years.

311
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:57,107
Thirty-five, Daddy.

312
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,410
Honey, I was there.

313
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,163
I've come to two decisions.

314
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,665
One: I've decided
not to up your allowance.

315
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,766
Two...

316
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:06,951
I don't want to hear two.

317
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,219
Well, you're going to.

318
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:11,521
Two: I've decided to pull
the plug on your Boston life.

319
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:13,657
You're coming back home
to live with your mother and me.

320
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,992
What?!

321
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,728
I'm sorry to say
you've made a mess of things.

322
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,031
Now, I'm going back
to my hotel to pack.

323
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,666
I expect you to do the same.

324
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,001
H-Hold it a
second, Daddy.

325
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,669
You can't do this to me.

326
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,104
I am a grown woman.

327
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,305
I'm an adult!

328
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,340
I can stand on my own two feet.

329
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,275
You heard me.

330
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,976
You're coming back home with me.

331
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:35,045
I hate you!

332
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,180
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

333
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:40,918
I wish I was adopted!

334
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,187
I wish I was never born!

335
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,026
I don't mind telling you

336
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,595
that went a lot better
than I thought it would.

337
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:06,143
Well, Malone, how long do you
think she can stay in there?

338
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,411
Sorry to say, sir,

339
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:08,512
for a long time.

340
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:09,713
There's food in there,
there's water,

341
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,615
and the sofa pulls out
into a bed.

342
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,935
Well, there's a shock, sex boy.

343
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,386
Hey. You asked...

344
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:19,823
Daddy,

345
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,742
I've thought it over.

346
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,978
You were right as usual.

347
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,480
So I'll pack my things
and come home with you.

348
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:29,116
Well, just don't stand there.

349
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,887
Wait, wait, wait,
you can't, you...

350
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:36,256
You're not just gonna pack up
and go live in San Diego.

351
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,290
Why not?
Who am I kidding?

352
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,341
You heard him.

353
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm just a failure
here in Boston.

354
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:43,881
Oh, sure, I say it five years
ago and get yelled at.

355
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,834
You're doing the right thing,
sweetheart.

356
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,969
Your old room
is waiting for you.

357
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:53,073
You'll have a chance to regroup,
get your life back in order.

358
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,775
Yeah, that's how they
try to sell it to you,

359
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,444
but read the small,
fine print, baby.

360
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,845
After a couple of weeks,

361
00:14:57,912 --> 00:15:00,564
you'll be crazier
than a rat in a coffee can.

362
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:04,819
You'd better be running along,
sweetheart.

363
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,070
You've got a lot to do.

364
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,371
I'll meet you
back here tonight.

365
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,424
That- Wait-wait-wait.

366
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:12,226
That's it? You're
just gonna do it?

367
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,561
Well, he is my daddy.

368
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:15,679
Well,

369
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,031
well, he...

370
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,283
Well, you may not be able
to do it, but I can.

371
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:20,650
Excuse me for a minute, sir.

372
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,453
You know, if you don't
mind me saying so,

373
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,104
I-I don't think
you're being fair.

374
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:25,795
You can't ask her
to pack up and go

375
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,407
just 'cause you don't
think she made it.

376
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:30,694
Was it that kind of persuasive
arguing that got my daughter

377
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,797
into trying to conceive
your bastard child?

378
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:38,052
Boy, you-you really just can't
see your way past that, can you?

379
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:46,077
Everyone, I-I-I have
something to say to you.

380
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:48,195
I came here to this bar
five years ago

381
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:51,282
a strong, independent
business woman.

382
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,484
And now I'm going
to go back home

383
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,554
and move back in
with Mommy and Daddy.

384
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,422
You've all really
touched my life.

385
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,810
Captain Howe,
I normally make it a point

386
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:06,013
not to butt into people's
personal affairs, but, sir,

387
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:07,448
you are quite possibly
the meanest,

388
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:09,350
most loathsome father
I've ever seen.

389
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,985
Don't get your panties
in a bunch, son.

390
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,689
She's not going anywhere.

391
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:16,807
I beg your pardon?

392
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,593
I was using reverse psychology.

393
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:20,894
I tell her she's failed

394
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:23,064
and demand that she
come home with me.

395
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:26,400
She, in an effort to prove me
wrong, stands up to me,

396
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:29,537
tells me off, then refuses
to take any more money

397
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,305
from her mother and me.

398
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:33,941
We don't even have
her old room anymore.

399
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,943
It's a sewing room.

400
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:38,612
Oh, that's ni-
Y-Your wife sews, huh?

401
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,281
Don't impose
gender roles on me.

402
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,617
Trust me.

403
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,920
I know my daughter.

404
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:48,272
It may take a little while,
but eventually

405
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,507
she'll screw up her nerve,

406
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,643
she'll walk through that door,
and she'll tell me off.

407
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:57,614
In the meantime, I'll just,
uh, stay here and wait.

408
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:01,001
Give me a beer.

409
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,959
Sir, did I ever tell you that,
uh, I was in the Coast Guard?

410
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,972
Coast Guard, huh?

411
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,907
Well, you must be
very proud, Miss.

412
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,285
So buy a girl a drink?

413
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,216
(groans)

414
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:10,521
KELLY:
Honey, it's open.

415
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,220
Uh, Kelly?

416
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,454
What is all this?

417
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:31,892
You told me to move
all my furniture in so I did.

418
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,228
Why? Is there a problem?

419
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:38,246
Well, do you think you laid
it out in the best possible way?

420
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,635
I don't think
it matters, Woody.

421
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:43,336
We'll just live
in a cramped apartment.

422
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:45,138
All right, you win.

423
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,642
I'll call the realtor,
and-and, uh...

424
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,460
and we'll go look
at houses, okay?

425
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,095
You better hurry.

426
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,047
I can't feel my legs.

427
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:03,023
As a man who has 30 years
of naval experience,

428
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:06,093
I can say in all confidence
that if that crew got together

429
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,063
and shot Gilligan, they'd have
been off that island in a week.

430
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:13,434
Problem solved.

431
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,352
Well, I see it didn't
take you long

432
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,220
to suck him into
your little world there, Norm.

433
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,622
(chuckles):
You kidding?

434
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,190
Give me an hour with the Pope,

435
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,826
I'll have him singing
the Mister Ed theme.

436
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:26,930
So I-I take it Rebecca
hasn't returned yet?

437
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,599
No. I'm getting
worried, too, you know.

438
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,801
If she was gonna stand up to
her father, she'd be here.

439
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,003
And I'm afraid she's
gonna pack and go home.

440
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,340
God, it'll be nice to get
my daughter off the gravy train.

441
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:39,710
Finally, I can afford to retire.

442
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,680
Daddy, I'm ready to go home.

443
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,801
Uh, uh, just-just a second,
Pookie.

444
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:50,698
Boy, looks like your little plan
didn't work, huh, sir?

445
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,675
Uh, that-that was not a
criticism, but, uh, you know...

446
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:57,411
I-I thought that was
gonna work myself.

447
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:59,179
I thought it was
a damn good plan.

448
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,531
I-I don't understand
why it didn't w...

449
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,949
It should have worked
is what...

450
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,768
Is it still hot
in here? I'm...

451
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,090
Pookie, uh,

452
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,993
I have a little
confession to make.

453
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,413
You see, I only asked you
to come home with me

454
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,782
so, uh, so you would
stand up to me.

455
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,785
I was using reverse psychology.

456
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,054
Wow.

457
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,222
Yeah.

458
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,956
What time does our plane leave?

459
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,659
No, no, no, no, no, uh, Pookie.

460
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,210
Well, you still don't get it.

461
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,345
I was throwing
down the gauntlet

462
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,697
to make you prove that you could

463
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,199
take your life
in your own hands.

464
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,766
Oh, come on, Daddy,
let's get out of here.

465
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,502
No, no, no, no.
You're a big girl, now.

466
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,969
You don't need me anymore.

467
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:41,672
You can make it on your own.

468
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,507
No, I can't, Daddy.
I do need you.

469
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,392
Well, how about if, uh,

470
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,861
how about if I raise
your allowance 25%?

471
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:52,099
Just 25%?

472
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,397
Well, I'm a bigger failure
than that, Daddy.

473
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,955
You said so yourself.

474
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,106
Fifty percent.

475
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,543
Fifty percent.

476
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,513
Maybe I can make it.

477
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,515
Look out, Boston.

478
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,436
Pookie, I love you.

479
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,222
I love you, too.

480
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:16,423
But you know, Daddy,

481
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:18,558
with the high cost of
living and inflation...

482
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,826
Okay, okay, okay.

483
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,161
Seventy-five percent.

484
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:24,965
Look, Pookie,
can I go home now?

485
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:26,672
I got to get to work
in the morning.

486
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,301
Oh, Daddy, you work so hard.

487
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:29,702
When are you gonna
get to retire?

488
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,538
Apparently, when they
wrap a flag around me

489
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,972
and slide me off the ship.

490
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,577
Rebecca Howe,

491
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:40,113
you shamelessly extorted money

492
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,049
from your own father.

493
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:43,250
High five!

494
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,236
Wait-wait-wait
a minute.

495
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,938
So you were never
planning to leave?

496
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,172
No way.

497
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:54,111
When did you cook
this whole thing up?

498
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,680
When I went in the office
when I was mad,

499
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:58,849
I called my mother
to ask her what to do.

500
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,285
Huh, Mom.

501
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,652
Becks again.

502
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:03,720
Yeah.

503
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,888
The fish bit.

504
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,557
Mother, Mother,

505
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,092
your cut is in the mail.
