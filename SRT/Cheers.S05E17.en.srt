3
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:13,396
(beeping)

4
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:14,898
Hi, Sam, this is Carla.

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,900
I'll be in a little late today.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,402
Eddie's really down
about his losing streak,

7
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,404
and I want to cheer him up.

8
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,406
It may take six or seven hours.

9
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:25,408
You know hockey players. Bye.

10
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:26,409
(beeping)

11
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,411
DIANE: Hi, Sam, it's me.

12
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,414
I'm on a little break from the trial.

13
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:35,418
We had some of the most
fascinating testimony today.

14
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,421
Of course, I'm not at
liberty to discuss it.

15
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,924
Suffice it to say...

16
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:44,544
(tape fast-forwarding)

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,548
...and the defendant had the
unmitigated gall to get...

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,017
Oh, uh, they're calling us back in.

19
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,019
I have to go. Love you. Bye.

20
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,521
(beeping)

21
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,822
Uh, this is Woody.

22
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,524
Sam, uh, I got home tonight

23
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,526
and remembered Diane
called after you left

24
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,528
and wanted me to give you a message.

25
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,280
I love you. Bye.

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,699
(beeping)

27
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,234
Uh, Sam, this is Woody again.

28
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,236
That message
I just left--

29
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,156
you understand it was Diane
saying I love you, not me.

30
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,125
All right, bye.

31
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,626
(beeping)

32
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,628
This is Woody again.

33
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:22,332
Uh, don't misunderstand
me, I really like you a lot.

34
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,136
(beeping)

35
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,554
This is Woody again.

36
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,390
Uh, I've been thinking it over, Sam.

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,809
I do love you.

Hey, uh, Normie?

54
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,088
Are you going to do my
taxes again this year?

55
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,590
Sure thing, bud.

56
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,592
Yeah, boy, I'm going to need some help

57
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,094
shuffling through these
new tax laws, I'll tell you.

58
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,013
What new tax laws?

59
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,770
Maybe, uh, maybe I'll just
short-form it this year.

60
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:13,576
See there's a little more
Eddie LeBec trade talk here.

61
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,944
CLIFF: Oh, yeah?

62
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,196
Oh, terrific.

63
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,199
Uh, Bruins are playing
Gretzky at Edmonton tonight.

64
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,084
Boy, another chance to see Eddie

65
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,835
"Come on in and bring your puck" LeBec.

66
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,836
(chuckling): Yeah.

67
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,837
Boy, I tell you, that zuke

68
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,207
is a disgrace to his
teammates and this fair city.

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,341
Come on, give him a break.

70
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,176
Well, Sammy, it's not
like we're not for the guy.

71
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,178
I mean, especially with
Carla going out with him.

72
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,681
But, you know, the guy's in
a major slump, let's face it.

73
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,933
CLIFF: Hey, I can tell you an
interesting thing about slumps, too.

74
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,852
Uh, statistics show that they can
be grouped into four categories.

75
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,853
Yeah? Yeah, that's right.

76
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,607
Uh, 65 percent physical,
17 percent emotional,

77
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:49,946
yeah, 15 percent psychological
and, uh, three percent dental.

78
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:51,447
Cliffie, you know something, man?

79
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:52,899
You're a walking encyclopedia.

80
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,400
Oh, thank you, Normie.

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,903
Unfortunately, you're also
a talking encyclopedia.

82
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,911
MAN: Motions, recess, motions, recess.

83
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,413
When is this thing going to end?

84
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,417
Two weeks, and the wife hasn't
even taken the stand yet.

85
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,504
Sorry. I missed a couple
words of testimony.

86
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,005
I wanted to go back and double-check it

87
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,390
with the court reporter.

88
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,676
Why do you keep your own
record of the testimony?

89
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,928
They write down everything that's said.

90
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,647
They don't write down emotions...

91
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,736
...attitudes, telling facial glances.

92
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,654
Study my face.

93
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,157
What am I thinking?

94
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,029
As the foreman of your jury,

95
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,281
I feel

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,032
that it is my duty

97
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,536
to record each shred of evidence

98
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,538
to give us every kernel of information

99
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,041
so that we can make the
thoughtful and correct decision.

100
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,793
WOMAN: Well, I've already

101
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,627
made my decision.

102
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,129
I think he's innocent.

103
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,096
Yes. Me, too.

104
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,099
Well, why don't we
just tell the judge that

105
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,100
and go home?

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,101
(everyone agreeing)

107
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,102
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

108
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,105
How can you possibly think that?

109
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,107
I believed his testimony.

110
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,809
Seems like a good guy.

111
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,061
And he was impeccably dressed.

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,864
I can't believe that I'm hearing this.

113
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,734
These are your grounds for acquittal?

114
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,988
Well, pardon me my objectivity,
but I don't happen to agree.

115
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,406
He did it!

116
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,408
I'm sure of it.

117
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,660
I can tell just by looking at him.

118
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,829
Oh, yeah? Yes.

119
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,631
I was in a very similar

120
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,083
situation to the wife in that my fiancé

121
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,586
has the same disarming brand of charm.

122
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,587
Are you saying

123
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,090
that you're about to marry a murderer?

124
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,592
MAN: No, don't stop her.

125
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,977
Let her do it.

126
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,149
Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha!

127
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,069
Laugh if you will.

128
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,572
I'm not fooled by Mr. Grand,
and neither should you be.

129
00:05:58,574 --> 00:05:59,575
Ladies and gentlemen,

130
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,577
the judge would like you
back in the courtroom.

131
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:02,578
WOMAN: What's going on?

132
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,080
Well, just between us,

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,082
Mrs. Grand is dropping the charges.

134
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:07,583
Dropping charges?

135
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,085
Why?

136
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,087
She realized she still
loves her husband.

137
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,088
Excuse me.

138
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,589
Would it be possible

139
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,091
for me to talk with Mrs. Grand?

140
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,592
Are you serious?

141
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:17,593
It's over.

142
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,595
Oh, I am so happy for him.

143
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,097
MAN: I'm happy for us.

144
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:23,599
No more jury duty.

145
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,102
Oh, where are you guys going afterward?

146
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,892
I tell you, the guy's a bum!

147
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,862
Sammy, two, uh, drafts and a Manhattan.

148
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,363
And who's a bum?

149
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,899
Eddie. Fisher. Eddie Fisher.

150
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,903
The guy hasn't had a
hit record in years.

151
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,373
Well, you better be talking
about him and not my Eddie.

152
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,741
Are you worried about the game tonight?

153
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,626
Of course I'm worried about it.

154
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,627
I know Eddie's had

155
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,580
a couple of bad games. Seven.

156
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,582
Nine.

157
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,586
Seven. I've never been
very good with numbers.

158
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,388
CARLA: Yeah, well,

159
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,258
I got a really good feeling
about tonight's game, you know?

160
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,260
The weather's cleared, it's a full moon,

161
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,263
and it's an even-numbered
day in an even-numbered month.

162
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,265
He'll turn it around
tonight, you'll see.

163
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,767
Oh, I think you're right.
Oh, yeah, absolutely, Carla.

164
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,152
There you go. Absolutely.

165
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:17,937
Hey, uh, I don't know if you guys

166
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
have the same feeling I do,

167
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,442
but I think it is just
more than a coincidence

168
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
that Eddie LeBec's, uh, bad run started

169
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
when he began dating Carla.

170
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
I say she's a jinx.

171
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
Oh, come on; hey, don't say that.

172
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,835
I mean, Carla's finally found
someone she really likes.

173
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,587
But what else could it possibly be, Sam?

174
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,588
Aw, it's ridiculous.

175
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,089
I-I don't believe in that.

176
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,591
Yeah, hey, Frasier, come here.

177
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,593
Listen, tell these guys, will you,

178
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,595
that there's nothing to the idea

179
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,964
that Carla might be jinxing Eddie.

180
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,215
Well, Sam, technically,

181
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,718
there is no such thing
as a jinx, unless...

182
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,220
someone thinks there is.

183
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,605
Now, we know that Eddie's
very superstitious.

184
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,023
If he believes that Carla's a jinx,

185
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:56,392
I'm afraid it becomes a self
- fulfilling prophecy.

186
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,145
All right, so Carla's a jinx.

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,147
What are we going to do about it?

188
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,649
Well, I don't know about
the rest of you guys,

189
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,651
but I am not going to
let that woman kiss me.

190
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,153
Yeah, right.

191
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,157
Like there's a real danger
of that happening. Right.

192
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,042
Hello, everyone.

193
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,460
Oh, hello.

194
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,462
Well, Sam, you'll be happy to know

195
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,965
that you have me back full-time now.

196
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:19,966
Oh.

197
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,467
The trial is over.

198
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,335
Well, good. Who won?

199
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,720
Certainly not justice.

200
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,091
I'm afraid the wife
decided to drop all charges.

201
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,594
But I say the husband is a con artist

202
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,597
who somehow managed to
convince that naive woman

203
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,982
that he loves her.

204
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,434
How can a man

205
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,937
tell a woman that he loves her

206
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,939
and yet try to kill her?

207
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,941
I can see it. I can see it.

208
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,444
Sammy, uh, could you,
uh, step down to my office

209
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,829
for one second, please?

210
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,615
Listen, uh, we were thinking

211
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,116
maybe someone's got to tell Carla

212
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,501
that she's jinxing Eddie.

213
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,754
And what suicidal idiot did
you have in mind to do that?

214
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,790
You know, your name kept
coming up in the discussion...

215
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,458
No, no, no, no, no...

216
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,259
Come on, Sammy.

217
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,760
Look, it's just for all us guys

218
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,262
whose lives are so damn shallow

219
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,764
that we depend upon the success
of our local sports teams

220
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,766
to give us a little
identity around here.

221
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,768
Am I right? Huh? No, no, no, no way.

222
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,270
Listen, if you want to do this,

223
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,272
then we'll do it fair and square.

224
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,773
We'll draw straws. Don't look.

225
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,275
CLIFF: Oh, that's fair, Normie.

226
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,278
Now, I want the person who
has to tell Carla to know

227
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,148
that there's a choir job
waiting for them in Vienna.

228
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,535
Sorry, Norm.

229
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,537
Well, on the upside, Normie,

230
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,041
you're in for some great strudel.

231
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,042
Oh, damn.

232
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,544
I've never been to Europe.

233
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,548
Listen, uh... Carla,

234
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,799
uh...

235
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,085
a few of the guys and
I have been thinking.

236
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,587
Now, this probably has, like,

237
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
absolutely nothing to do with anything,

238
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,341
but, uh... You know, Norm,

239
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,144
I've been thinking about Eddie

240
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,647
and what's happened to his
game and all that, and...

241
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:02,652
do you think it's possible
that I could be jinxing him?

242
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,906
You? Jinxing Eddie?

243
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,909
That's silly. No way!

244
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,410
(chuckling): No.

245
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,778
(whispering): Thank you, God.

246
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,615
Sam?

247
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
Yeah?

248
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
You don't think it's possible

249
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
that I'm jinxing Eddie, do you?

250
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
No.

251
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
Me, either.

252
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
It's got to be something else.

253
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
And when he comes here,

254
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
we're going to figure it out together.

255
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,012
You really like the guy, don't you?

256
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,765
I am this close to falling hard for him.

257
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh, boy.

258
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,770
Hey, Eddie!

259
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,771
Oh... CARLA: Hey, Eddie!

260
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,772
Hi.

261
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,723
How's it going?

262
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,225
Well, after my last game,

263
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,729
a fan sent me some new equipment.

264
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,115
Dark glasses and a white cane.

265
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,033
Oh, you're just having a slump.

266
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,535
You'll get out of it.

267
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:53,903
I don't know, Sam.

268
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,237
I've tried everything.

269
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,241
I've been watching game
films, taking extra practice.

270
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,743
I don't know what to do.

271
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,745
What did you used to do
to break out of slumps

272
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,746
when you were pitching, Sam?

273
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,749
Me? Well, I, uh, drank
myself into a coma.

274
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,135
Did it work?

275
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,924
Hey, Eddie. Hey, hey, Carla.

276
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,426
Tonight's your night; I know it.

277
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,428
Yeah, well, facing Gretzky, eh?

278
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,429
Hey, forget him.

279
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,431
You carrying that lucky clove

280
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,933
of garlic I gave you? Yeah.

281
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,935
Yes, he is.

282
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,437
I don't know, Carla.

283
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm starting to get that choking feeling

284
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,440
I usually get a day or two

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,442
before they send me down to the minors.

286
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,944
No, no, no, come on!

287
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,445
I don't want to hear any of that.

288
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,447
There's got to be an
explanation for this,

289
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,449
and we're going to
figure it out right now.

290
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,334
Let's take it from the beginning, okay?

291
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,670
When was the last time you won?

292
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,671
Well, let's see.

293
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,674
I think that would be
the Canadiens game, eh?

294
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,177
Um, that's right, because I remember

295
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,179
that's the night we met.

296
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,681
Yeah... could've been
somewhere around then.

297
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,050
Yeah, so, um, when did things

298
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,852
start going bad?

299
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,854
Well, I guess that
would be the next game.

300
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:06,358
Right. All right, now think really hard.

301
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,362
Have you been doing anything
different during that time--

302
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,864
um, eating different foods,

303
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,866
taking a different route to the Garden,

304
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,367
buying different magazines?

305
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,369
I mean, anything, anything at all?

306
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,871
No, no, nothing at all.

307
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,372
I... I've been living my life

308
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,875
the same way as I've always lived it.

309
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,876
Except for one thing.

310
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,920
Eddie, do me a favor.

311
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,255
Yeah, Carla.

312
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,473
Beat it.

313
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,258
What's the problem?

314
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,512
The problem is... we
just don't work anymore.

315
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,814
It's been a lot of grins,

316
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,183
but we both knew it wasn't
going to last forever.

317
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,984
So, it's time for you
to hit the pavement.

318
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,352
Well, hey, I... I don't get it.

319
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,354
I thought things were
going great for us.

320
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,857
Yeah, well, they were,
but they're not anymore,

321
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,860
and I just don't want to
talk about it, so shove off!

322
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,862
Okay.

323
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,747
Whatever you say.

324
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,536
I'll see you around, I guess.

325
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,093
Pretty gutsy thing to do.

326
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,545
Gutsy? Nothin'.

327
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,048
I'm going to prove to all you yutzes

328
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,051
and to myself that I'm no jinx.

329
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,554
If Eddie loses tonight,
it's not my fault.

330
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,555
You'll see.

331
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,943
He can stink just as bad
without me as he stunk with me.

332
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:39,318
It's not Romeo and Juliet,
but it has a certain charm.

333
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,940
TV ANNOUNCER: Time running
out in the third period.

334
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,659
It's still one-nothing,
favor of the Boston Bruins.

335
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
Here's Gretzky across the
Boston line, taps in front.

336
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,663
Rolling save by Eddie LeBec!

337
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,531
(cheering) He went
sprawling to the front side

338
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,782
and kicked it out with his right hand.

339
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,618
Sammy, two beers and a vodka rocks.

340
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

341
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,621
Come on, is my order up yet?

342
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,623
What? Oh, c-come on, give me a second.

343
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,625
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! There's
people here, Sammy?

344
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,126
Are you running a bar
or you just watching

345
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:05,527
some stupid hockey game?

346
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,129
All right, all right, all right.

347
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,131
You want to know what the score is?

348
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,599
Is Boston leading?

349
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,101
Yeah.

350
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,469
Did the Oilers score on Eddie?

351
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:14,470
No.

352
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,971
I'm not interested.

353
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,273
Whoa, look out, whoa!

354
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,557
Penalty?!

355
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,059
He calls that slashing?

356
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,943
Well, Frasier,

357
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,611
he nearly cut Curry in half there.

358
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,396
Oh, ticky-tack. It's a wussy call.

359
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,398
Let the guys play the game.

360
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,737
Good eve...

361
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:37,209
Aren't you... Bill and Sherry Grand?

362
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,577
That's right.

363
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,914
(laughs): Oh...

364
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,916
What an incredible coincidence.

365
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,802
I was the foreman of
the jury at your trial.

366
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,004
Oh, yeah, the one with the notebook.

367
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,389
Oh, you noticed?

368
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,390
It was hard not to.

369
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,676
I was keeping track of the testimony.

370
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,927
Diane Chambers. Hello.

371
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,929
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

372
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,431
Why weren't you at the party?

373
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,933
Party? What party?

374
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,818
The party the jury threw for me.

375
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm surprised they
would've had it without you.

376
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,023
You seem so... attractive
and intelligent.

377
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:11,327
Yes, well, those qualities
confuse some people.

378
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,329
Besides, I had to work.

379
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,830
But who cares about me?

380
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,700
The important thing is you two
are back together again, huh?

381
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,452
Thank you. Could we maybe order?

382
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,453
(laughs)

383
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,455
I'd like a glass of white wine.

384
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,340
Wine.

385
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,674
What-what would you like?

386
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,675
I'll have a Bloody Mary.

387
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,093
(throaty laugh)

388
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,100
Excuse me.

389
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,603
I know this is very forward of me,

390
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,972
but the last time I saw you in court,

391
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,473
you were ranting and raving,

392
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,975
calling this man a wife murderer.

393
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,477
It's... very shocking for me

394
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,480
to see you with him now, so blissful.

395
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,951
I guess I just realized
how much I love him.

396
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,237
I really admire your...
your trust, your conviction.

397
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:56,739
If you don't mind a
little friendly advice,

398
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,741
I'd sleep with one eye open.

399
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,745
I'll get the drinks.

400
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,747
It's a good thing you
dropped the charges.

401
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:08,250
I'd hate to have my fate in her hands.

402
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,752
Bill...

403
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,806
why did you have the
power saw in the kitchen?

404
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,426
(cheering)

405
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,761
Sam... Hit 'em!

406
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,264
A white wine and a... Bloody Mary.

407
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:25,267
Oh... human nature.

408
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,769
What?! Oh...

409
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,771
that couple over there.

410
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:29,772
They're the Grands.

411
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:31,774
You remember.

412
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:35,160
The case on which I
was foreman of the jury?

413
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,663
Oh, right, right, right,
the, uh, power saw.

414
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,531
DIANE: I know. You don't trust me?

415
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, I tell you, it never ceases

416
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,253
to amaze me how some
people can be so ignorant

417
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,755
of what is obvious to
the rest of the world.

418
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,257
DIANE: Well, I guess there's something

419
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,758
to be said for forgiveness.

420
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,712
In fact, in this rather
jaded day and age,

421
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,633
it's nice to know that amor vincit omnia.

422
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,634
Hmm?

423
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,135
Love conquers all.

424
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,136
Mm.

425
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,639
And I, for one, shall
not stand in its way.

426
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,641
You know, Sam, I'm going
to pay for this round.

427
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,642
Well, you better hurry.

428
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,143
It looks like he's about to fire up

429
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,144
the old Black & Decker there.

430
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,030
(indistinct arguing)

431
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,900
Oh, don't touch me!

432
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,901
Stay away from me!

433
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,286
Just stay away from me!

434
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,238
What happened?

435
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,706
What happened?

436
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,076
Why don't you check your
stupid little notebook?!

437
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,547
So... the system works after all.

438
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,084
TV ANNOUNCER: Back the Oilers
go, back behind the net.

439
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,086
Mark Muskee starting
out for the center ice.

440
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,587
Oilers trailing, one-nothing.

441
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,588
They fool the goal tender.

442
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,474
Pressure really on
Eddie LeBec right now.

443
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,761
Please screw up, please
screw up, please screw up.

444
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,763
Sam, I don't understand.

445
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,265
Why does Carla want Eddie to screw up?

446
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,266
(sighs)

447
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,768
Well, you see, if Eddie
loses, then Carla wins,

448
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,770
because it proves
she's no longer a jinx.

449
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,273
But if he wins, then Carla loses,

450
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,275
'cause it reinforces the jinx theory.

451
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,778
Ah, the old "boy loses, girl wins,

452
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,781
boy wins, girl loses"
jinx reinforcement theory.

453
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,251
If I've seen it once, I've seen it...

454
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,122
TV ANNOUNCER: Still
one-nothing, Boston Bruins lead.

455
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,090
Time running out on the game.

456
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,208
Oilers bring it out to center ice.

457
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,211
Here's Mark Messier across the
red line into the Bruins' zone.

458
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,213
Gives it down the left
side to Glenn Anderson,

459
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,214
cutting in in
front-- he shoots!

460
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,016
And it's saved by Eddie LeBec!

461
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,800
Point-blank range.

462
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,802
Eddie LeBec with a great save,

463
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,306
wins the game for the
Boston Bruins. Damn!

464
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,813
Hey, Sam.

465
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,814
Hey.

466
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,065
See the game tonight?

467
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,400
I sure did. Congratulations.

468
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,401
Thanks. Yeah.

469
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,903
It felt great. (chuckles)

470
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:41,904
Did you ever have one of those nights

471
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,405
you just knew you could do no wrong?

472
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,407
Oh, yeah, all the time.

473
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,910
Well, twice.

474
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,914
There you go. Thanks.

475
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,138
What are you doing here?

476
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,640
Just came by for a drink.

477
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,008
That okay?

478
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,843
Free country.

479
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,348
You know...

480
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,850
Carla, after the game tonight, I...

481
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,853
I figured out why you dumped me.

482
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,855
I guess I'm a little slow on the uptake

483
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,858
since I've taken so many on the melon.

484
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,829
I, uh...

485
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,332
I guess you wanted to see if
you were causin' my slump, eh?

486
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,334
Yeah, and guess what?

487
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,589
Well, it doesn't seem fair
that the girl that means

488
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,874
more to me than anybody else ever has,

489
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,877
you know, turns out to be a...

490
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,380
turns out, you know... Say it: a jinx.

491
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,266
A hex, a whammy, a voodoo, a curse.

492
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,136
What am I going to do?

493
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,024
You're not going to do anything.

494
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,275
I'm not going to be responsible

495
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,278
for the Bruins missing the playoffs

496
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,648
or for your career
going down the toilet.

497
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,743
Hey, Eddie.

498
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,245
Yeah.

499
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
Knock 'em dead.

500
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,466
Yeah.

501
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,251
And watch out for those wrist shots

502
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,753
low in the corner on your stick side.

503
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,639
Okay, you got it.

504
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,923
Oh.

505
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,177
I wanted you to have this.

506
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,512
What is it?

507
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,014
It's a recording of our song.

508
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:35,567
I thought... you know,
maybe sometime, you would...

509
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,352
I don't know, maybe play it and...

510
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:40,239
and, um, think of me...

511
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,408
you know, think good stuff.

512
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,577
I will.

513
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,582
Okay.

514
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,835
All right, I'll see you, Carla.

515
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,670
Yeah. See you.

516
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,171
You, too, Sam.

517
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,515
Well...

518
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,685
For a refreshing change,

519
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,689
Carla Tortelli ends up without the guy.

520
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,109
This shirt's drip-dry if
you want to give it a...

521
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,110
No, no, come on.

522
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,611
It's happened so many times,

523
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,613
my tear ducts are all dried up.

524
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,615
Why don't you go on home, Sam?

525
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,617
Come on. I'll clean up here.

526
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,618
Is that what you want?

527
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,621
Yeah, yeah, I think I want
to be alone for awhile.

528
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,124
Okay...

529
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,125
but if you want someone to talk to,

530
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,493
I'll be over at Diane's.

531
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,163
So, you know, if you want
to call, just go ahead.

532
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,632
Please call.

533
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,920
Thanks, Sam. Good night.

534
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:16,034
("O, Canada" intro played on pipe organ)

535
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:20,372
MALE SINGER (on tape): ?
O, Canada, our home and ?

536
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,675

Hey, Wood, what you working on?

542
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,649
Cheers newsletter.

543
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,651
Wood, Cheers doesn't have a newsletter.

544
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:53,655
Wow, there's a scoop.

545
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:55,157
I'll make that my lead story.

546
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,159
Ah.

547
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,660
Night, Wood.

548
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,162
G'night.

549
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:01,663
Say, Carla, you sure
you don't want to go

550
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:02,664
to the game with me tonight?

551
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,166
I'm really on a hot streak.

552
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,667
You're tellin' me
you're on a hot streak.

553
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,670
For the past few weeks,
you've been fantastic.

554
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,672
Not bad on the ice, either.

555
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,176
Hey, Eddie, do me a favor and beat it!

556
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,060
What's the problem?

557
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,928
Problem is we just don't work anymore.

558
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:17,929
It's been a lot of grins,

559
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,898
but we both knew it wasn't
going to last forever.

560
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,899
I don't get it.

561
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,651
I thought things were great between us.

562
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,437
Well, they were, but they're
not anymore, so hit the bricks.

563
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,438
All right, whatever you say.

564
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,940
Say, I was in here a
couple of weeks ago.

565
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,443
Didn't Carla and her
boyfriend break up then?

566
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,327
Yeah.

567
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,662
They do that before every game.

568
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,164
It's kind of a ritual.

569
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,666
Hey, Carla, that's it!

570
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,502
We're finished! Through! Good-bye!

571
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,453
Good-bye!

572
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,375
Red Wings Thursday
night. See you then, eh?

573
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:53,548
Superstitious little guy, but he's mine.
