1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,788
KlNG OF THE HlLL

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,519
- Coach, is this what l think it is?
- What do you think it is?

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,549
l think it's something totally useless that
some salesman talked you into buying.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,870
Boy, you're good at thinking, Sam.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,713
''The Billiard Buddy Pool Table Adapter.''

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,836
Yeah, but it's not useless, Sam.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,632
You can make it into a Ping-Pong table,
a knock hockey table, a salad bar.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,075
- How much?
- l don't know.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,196
A buck and a half with croutons.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,115
No, Coach,
l mean how much for the whole thing?

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,196
600 bucks, Sam, but the salesman said,
''Satisfaction guaranteed.''

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,716
- Or?
- That would have been a good question.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,996
$600?

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,913
Yeah, hard to believe, isn't it?

15
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,836
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

16
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,474
- What'll it be?
- The usual.

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,313
l'll have a trough of beer and a snorkel.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,390
Cliffie, maybe you could help me out.

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,358
- My mother-in-law's in town.
- Sorry.

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,718
- She wants to go sightseeing.
- Tell her to go to Florida.

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,231
l told her to go further south than that,
but she's interested in American history.

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,437
Norman, take your mother
to see Bunker Hill.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,273
- Where?
- Bunker Hill.

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,036
The scene of one of the most important
battles in American history.

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,159
That place l've got to go all the way
around to get to the pizza parlour?

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,788
No way.

27
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,916
Hey, Norm, your car's unlocked.

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,470
- Someone might steal your laundry.
- What laundry?

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,949
That big bundle on the front seat.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,271
That's my mother-in-law.
She had kind of a rough flight.

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,591
She nodded out the second
she hit the upholstery.

32
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,309
And you left her out there
in an unattended automobile?

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,553
l threw a blanket over her and l left her
a note in case she comes to.

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,832
She's lucky to have you
as a son-in-law, Norman.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,391
l give her the red-carpet treatment,
l guess. Hey, pal.

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,678
Could you do me a favour and toss
these in the blue Civic out in front?

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,550
- ls Sam Malone here?
- No. What can l buy from you?

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,280
What am l saying? What can l get you?

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,396
l'll have a beer.

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,869
My name is Lenny Barnes.

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,989
l'm the publicist for the charity softball
game this Saturday. l'm looking for Sam.

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,516
l can tell you right now.
He wouldn't be interested in that.

43
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,276
Nobody with any dignity wants to get
into those sideshow carnival things,

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,034
where everybody's made to look stupid.

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,478
- Aren't you Ernie Pantusso?
- l'd be honoured to do it.

46
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,235
- l don't think we need anybody else.
- Oh, well.

47
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,756
l find it hard to get up to
Fenway these days.

48
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,876
The old memories come back?

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,238
No, l keep getting the wrong bus.
l must have an old schedule.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,915
l guess those stories about you are true.

51
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,435
That they are, Lenny.

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,196
Mr Barnes, Coach is right. Sam never
plays in old-timer type games.

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,238
- Sam's already agreed to play.
- What?

54
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,630
l'm here for some publicity shots.

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,395
Lenny, why don't you take your beer
and have a seat and wait for Sam?

56
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,314
- Thank you. l have to make a call.
- Use the telephone.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,673
l'm so surprised at Sam, Diane.

58
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,356
He always said to me he'd never
get involved in one of these things.

59
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,669
Maybe Sam misses being out there on
the baseball field standing on the bump.

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,594
You got a point there. l miss
seeing him out there on the bump, too,

61
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,035
but incidentally, it's called a mound.

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,436
Unless we're not talking about
the same thing.

63
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,193
Thank you, Carla, for helping me.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,557
You're sure you want to quit?
l'm willing to catch a few more.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,792
You weren't toying
with the sound barrier out there.

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,077
No, l just wanted to loosen
up a little bit, that's all.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,439
l don't think you should be engaging in
strenuous activity when you're with child.

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,912
lf l didn't do things with child,
l'd never leave the house.

69
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,959
The only thing l ever did without child
resulted in one.

70
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
You're playing in this charity game?

71
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,718
Yeah. l was out there warming up.
My arm feels good.

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,836
Are you kidding me?

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,993
When a butterfly lands on a ball
in mid-flight, it's not cooking.

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,278
All l care about
is not embarrassing myself.

75
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,954
- Good luck.
- l have a right to be a little rusty.

76
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,750
The only thing l've thrown in the past
ten years is Diane's butt out of here.

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,558
No, you are thinking of the tantrums
you threw when l walked out of here.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,269
The only thing l enjoy hearing
more than you two argue

79
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,590
is hearing Cliff talk about Florida.

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,276
l was just about to tell Normie here
that Florida is a pollution-free state.

81
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,590
You know how they treat solid waste?

82
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,274
You said they treated you very well.

83
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,115
- Hey, Sam.
- Lenny, how are you doing?

84
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,874
l'm fine.
l arranged to have a photographer

85
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,157
and your opponents
drop by for publicity stills.

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,154
- Right now?
- They should be here right away.

87
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,075
What brought about this sudden
altruistic bent in your personality?

88
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,633
l resent that. l've always cared deeply
for people less fortunate than myself.

89
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,916
Here they are.

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,878
Sam, you great big humanitarian.

91
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,350
Who says you can't work for a worthy
cause and still be sexually aroused?

92
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,229
You could be having an appendectomy
and still be sexually aroused.

93
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,949
Be that as it may.
l have to excuse myself now

94
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,396
and go say hello
to my fellow do-gooders.

95
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,035
- Are those dames or what?
- This is disgusting.

96
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,153
ln what kind of culture do l live
where they are the ideal woman?

97
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,993
You've got admit they are beautiful.

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,833
Coach, take away all their make-up,

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,516
all their expensive haircuts and those
bodies and what have you got?

100
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,671
You.

101
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,753
- Hey, they're Playboy Playmates.
- Get out of here.

102
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,469
l recognise Miss February
of a few years back.

103
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,474
She's a native of Montana, hates
the hustle and bustle of the big city.

104
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,313
Her turn-ons include strong
but sensitive men,

105
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,438
classical music and rainy afternoons.

106
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,994
Hard to believe that Vera
and those are the same sex.

107
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,914
Excuse me. Does anyone have a blue
Civic with a bumper sticker that says,

108
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,631
- ''Accountants Do lt With lnterest''?
- That would be mine. lt's true.

109
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,032
- They're towing it away.
- You noticed an old lady getting out?

110
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,998
- No.
- Great. Another round, Coach.

111
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,995
- What about your mother-in-law?
- She's safe. The cops have her.

112
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,997
- So my place or yours?
- l have a roommate.

113
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,116
Yours it is.

114
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,757
- Would you take your drink?
- Are you upset about something?

115
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,639
You know what bugs me
about women like you?

116
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,349
You take off all your clothes,
you pose for a magazine,

117
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,954
thousands of men see you naked.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,998
l have to go to them one by one.
lt's not fair.

119
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,998
You look gorgeous, Sam.

120
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,197
Get up there
and put your arms around the girls.

121
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,158
Put my arms around them, you say?

122
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,156
Squeeze in there real tight, Sam.
That's good.

123
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,596
OK. Tell me, Sam, how do you feel
about the game on Saturday?

124
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,671
lt's a challenge of a lifetime.

125
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,675
We're looking at natural assets that will
play havoc with the strike zone.

126
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,318
No, l'm looking forward to the game

127
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,758
and l'm particularly looking forward
to the shower afterwards.

128
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,868
Seriously, it will be a great game.
l hope that everybody comes out

129
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,996
to support a worthy cause.

130
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,790
Step down and let me get a shot of the
girls. Put them over here by the door.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,430
l know what you're thinking
and l don't care.

132
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,876
lf you think l'm even concerned,
you are wrong.

133
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,475
Your sortie into sordidness has no effect
on my emotions.

134
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,997
You could make love to all five of those
women and l would feel nothing.

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,116
As l'm sure would they.

136
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,154
Let me introduce you to the girls.

137
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,393
l'd like to show them the charity
l was involved with last year.

138
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,033
You are a sand flea.

139
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,516
That's the thanks l get?

140
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,430
Hey, Coach,
what happened to our pool table?

141
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,357
lt's still there, but thanks to our Billiard
Buddy Adaptor, it's more fun than ever.

142
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,516
lt can be a knock hockey table,
a Ping-Pong table. You name it.

143
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,477
l want a pool table.

144
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,191
Let me get out my easy-to-follow
conversion instructions here.

145
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,756
Tool kit.

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,796
For moving...

147
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,953
And that.

148
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,112
- Coach, how long is this going to take?
- 20 minutes.

149
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,035
- 20 minutes to put it together?
- No, to figure what the hell this is.

150
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,157
- Forget it. l'll play Ping-Pong.
- God bless you.

151
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,795
The play of the game was when Angela
had to reach back to catch that foul ball.

152
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,996
That was a thing of beauty, Normie.

153
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,315
The best one was Ginger bending down
to catch that grounder. l had to applaud.

154
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,996
Let's not forget when Rosemary and
Ginger kind of bumped into each other.

155
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,550
Either one of you manage to sneak
a peak at the scoreboard?

156
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,676
There was a scoreboard?

157
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,072
The final score was Sam's team seven,
Playmates zero.

158
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,312
He was blowing those girls away.
lt was a massacre.

159
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,713
l lost track of the final strike outs, but the
important thing is the twinkies lost.

160
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,558
- Did you hear l got 1 8 strike outs?
- Sam, l counted 1 7.

161
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,234
The ump was blind.
That ball cut the corner.

162
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,039
Drinks are on me. We're celebrating.

163
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,509
Sammy,
what happened to the Playmates?

164
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,194
l thought they were coming here
after the game.

165
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,399
They were. l guess they're sore losers.
What happened to sportsmanship?

166
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,473
Maybe they were put off
by your victory laps.

167
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,269
Come on, man. That was just a joke.

168
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,230
That was a pretty good game, wasn't it?
l really had my stuff back.

169
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,472
- Wasn't it supposed to be for fun?
- That's right.

170
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,156
l had a great time.
Hey, guys, l really had my stuff.

171
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,312
Magnificent, Sam.
Any chance the girls'll be by?

172
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,789
Would you guys forget the girls here?

173
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,918
l just won a game,
didn't let anybody pass first base

174
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,914
and you're pretending
it is an ordinary day.

175
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,036
Excuse me.

176
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,555
l'm not an expert in the field of sports,

177
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,679
but it's my impression that the fans paid
to see the little Playmates

178
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,991
wiggling their heinies around the bases.

179
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,913
You're the last person
l want to talk to today.

180
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,389
You're not in the top five any day,

181
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,838
but for your information, people paid
good money to watch Sam Malone pitch.

182
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,468
l paid for heinies.

183
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,668
Come on! People don't pay to watch
their baseball stars stink.

184
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,673
They pay to watch them
relive their old glories.

185
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,277
Sammy l was more thrilled than anybody
to see you out there flinging it again,

186
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,991
but even l was a little embarrassed
when you put one in Babette's ear

187
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,594
cos she was crowding the plate.

188
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,115
Hey, the plate belongs to me.

189
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,909
lf she can't stand the heat, she
shouldn't have crossed the baseline.

190
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,629
- We're celebrating, guys.
- Sam, you knocked a girl down?

191
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,349
No, Coach, l didn't knock a girl down.
l knocked a batter down.

192
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,593
- She was halfway across the plate.
- Halfway across. She deserves it.

193
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,275
- Let's celebrate.
- Yes, by all means. Let's celebrate.

194
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,749
This is a major accomplishment, Sam.

195
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,629
l think you're ready to take on
the Camp Fire Girls All-Stars.

196
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,995
Way to go, Diane.

197
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,394
You guys want to go out there now
and face me?

198
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,237
Any of you. Get a bat. First person that
gets a hit off me, l'll give them the bar.

199
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,474
Any takers? l thought that would
shut you up, you gutless wonders.

200
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,111
Why don't you go over to the Playboy
Club and hang out with the losing team?

201
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,432
Coach, l'm going to be
in the back room...alone.

202
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,036
Good, Diane's here.

203
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,349
Sam, you are an attractive man.
You have many friends.

204
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,196
You have a lot going for you. But you
have one miserable character flaw.

205
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,273
Gee, l wonder if l could coax you
into telling me what that is.

206
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,110
You and l dated
for what seemed an eternity

207
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,635
and l think l know you pretty well.

208
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,873
You get into a contest
and you'd rather die than lose.

209
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,395
l'm surmising, but a fear of losing drove
you to drink and ruined your career.

210
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,676
l'll tell you something
and then l'd appreciate it if you leave.

211
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,957
A little competitiveness
is a healthy thing.

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,154
But you have more than a little
competitiveness. Sam, you're very sick.

213
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,439
- l am not.
- Yes, you are and l can prove it.

214
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,556
Why did you play this game?

215
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,637
To impress a bevy of buxom Bunnies,
who now will never speak to you again.

216
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,032
You wanted to beat them
more than you wanted to bed them.

217
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,794
My God, l am sick.

218
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,473
You're not sick. You just have a problem.

219
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,791
l know. l've always had it.

220
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,553
You approached games in this same
way when you were a child?

221
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,953
Especially when l was a child.
My parents were kind of tough on me.

222
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,114
l couldn't please them. lf l got a C
in school, they said, ''Why not a B?''

223
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,829
- lf l got a B, ''Why didn't you get an A?''
- And if you got an A?

224
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,877
Sorry.

225
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,674
You know, in high school
once l pitched a two-hitter.

226
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,549
All my dad could talk about
were the lousy two damn hits.

227
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,112
Sam, this is wonderful.

228
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,037
You're sharing an attempt to confront
the roots of your self-involvement.

229
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,073
l had no idea
you could relate on this level.

230
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,915
Yeah, it kind of feels good
to open up like this.

231
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,077
When l was about six l made my dad
breakfast in bed on Father's Day.

232
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,754
l was really proud of myself.

233
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,790
All he could say was the eggs were
too dry and the toast was too light.

234
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,312
Sam, l'm feeling a closeness to you now

235
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,270
that compels me to share
a core feeling of my own,

236
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,718
something which l have yet to make
privy to my analyst.

237
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,596
lt happened my 1 7th summer...

238
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,309
lf l'd made the toast any darker,
he would have said l burned it.

239
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,278
l was brimming
with the innocence of youth...

240
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,671
Everybody else would have said,
''That toast is fine.''

241
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,513
Stop with the damn toast tragedy.

242
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,429
- What's your problem?
- l'm trying to share something painful.

243
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,718
- And you keep cutting me off.
- l was talking about my dad.

244
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,317
l was going to tell you about the time
l stayed home from the prom.

245
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,437
You interrupted my dad's story for that?

246
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,433
What more was there?
He didn't like your toast.

247
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,153
Fine. Tell me all about your dance story.

248
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,518
Does this have anything to do
with mice and glass slippers?

249
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,672
l assure you my prom story would make
your story look like self-pitying tripe.

250
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,630
All right. Right now l'm going to admit
that l'm a very competitive person.

251
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,031
lt just occurred to me
why our relationship never worked.

252
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,156
You always had to have the last say.

253
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,675
You had to be on top
and you're still doing it.

254
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,354
You are just as competitive as l am.

255
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,678
Me? l'm not competitive.

256
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,274
l'm intense and strong-willed.

257
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,036
But l think
that mindless games and contests

258
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,556
are very destructive
and diminish the human spirit.

259
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,473
ls that right? Want to play Ping-Pong?

260
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,996
Of course l don't want to play
Ping-Pong. lt's preposterous.

261
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,116
lt's not exactly my best sport.

262
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,193
A lot of people beat me at it,
but l bet l could beat you.

263
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,316
What if you did? What would it prove?

264
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,994
That l'm having a great day,
my dad was wrong,

265
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,594
God's in His heaven and you are a loser.

266
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,428
As always, you are just trying
to avoid the central issue here.

267
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,196
Come on, chicken.

268
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,430
Don't do this, Sam.

269
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,555
l've played Ping-Pong.

270
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,390
My father built me an elaborate rec room
when l was a child. My daddy liked me.

271
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,798
Yeah, l bet you got lots of practice
staying home from all those proms.

272
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,233
Yes. lt gave me the opportunity to
master the complexities of making toast.

273
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,470
Nice serve, Diane. All right.

274
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,309
Yeah, you'll be easy. l'm real worried.

275
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,952
And since that time, Norm,
l've never feared death.

276
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,831
- My point!
- Lucky shot. Come on, serve.

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,436
- What are we doing?
- lt's called Ping-Pong. Serve.

278
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,591
This all started out with us arguing
over who is the most competitive.

279
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,877
What are we proving
by knocking a ball all night?

280
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,838
lt won't be all night.
l'm about to win. Serve.

281
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,758
Let's start by admitting
that we both have a problem.

282
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,789
Let's put down our paddles
simultaneously and walk away from this.

283
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,356
You're quitting? ls that it?

284
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,753
As it so happens, l am a point ahead.
l could win on this serve.

285
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,357
l am suggesting
a greater triumph for us both.

286
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,308
A victory over this destructive problem
we both have.

287
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,678
Let's beat our paddles
into ploughshares, Sam.

288
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,272
Say again?

289
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,318
Try this for me
and see if you don't feel better.

290
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,471
l'm putting down my paddle.

291
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,913
Join me in this victory, Sam.

292
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,591
- How do you feel?
- l feel OK.

293
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,673
- As a matter of fact, l feel pretty good.
- Good.

294
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,354
- Like to buy me a cup of coffee?
- You bet.

295
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,035
- How about that?
- Just one more thing.

296
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,753
- l win!
- You're not getting out of here alive.

297
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,195
- Don't be a sore loser.
- You'll be sore.

298
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,237
That's why they call those paddles.

299
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,595
