00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,900
Hey, guys,                      

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
  guess what followed me home.  

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,600
                  A slime trail?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,800
        This cute little        
    fellow right here.          

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,900
Huh?                            

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
        Isn't he sweet?         

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,700
     The cutest little dog      
     you've ever seen, huh?     

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
            What you gonna do   
                with him, Cliff?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Oh, I, I thought we'd just keep 
him in the bar here, Sam,       

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,900
     you know, kind of like     
         a bar mascot.          

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,300
    Guys, I kind of thought     
     I was the bar mascot.      

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,100
I don't think so, Cliffy.       

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,800
    All right, Sammy.           

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
        Come on, Spotty.        

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
            Bye-bye, Spotty.    

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,400
         Oh, how cute.          

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi, little fellow.              

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,200
    Ah.                         

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,800
What's his name?                

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,200
         Well, this is,         
      this is Spotty, huh?      

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,700
                  Isn't he cute?

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,300
         Yeah, he's kind of like
             the-the bar mascot.

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,500
                  Hey, you know,

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
    he and I are about          
        to take a bath.         

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Would you like to join us?      

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,800
      (theme song begins)       

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,800
 Takes everything you've got  

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,500
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,000
 Sure would help a lot         

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,900
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
   Sometimes you want to go    

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,900
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,800
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,700
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,000
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,100
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,400
   People are all the same     

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,000
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,500
                Hey, Mr. Clavin,

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,700
        if you're looking for   
    a home for the dog there,   

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
                    I'd be happy
                    to take him.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,300
Ah, no, Woody.                  

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
You see, Spotty here is         
a thoroughbred puppy.           

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,200
Needs a lot of attention, a lot 
 of care, needs a lot of space. 

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,800
    I'll give you five bucks    
            for him.            

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
          Here you go.          

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,700
      Hello. Any messages?      

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
        Oh, yeah.               

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,900
    One of your old baseball    
 buddies called, Dutch Kincaid. 

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
        I'll be damned.         
     Wonder what he wants?      

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,600
Probably another home run.      

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,100
I think you served him up       
something like 27 in his career.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,800
                What did that   
            work out to, Sam?   

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,100
    Oh, yeah, uh, one           
  for every time he faced you.  

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,800
    That was a long time ago.   
                        Yeah.   

60
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
      Poor guy's probably       
         down and out--         

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,400
  wants to borrow a few bucks   
            from me.            

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,100
  No. He wants you to show up   

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
     for Dutch Kincaid Day      
    at Yankee Stadium.          

64
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,400
  They're having a Dutch Kincaid
          Day at Yankee Stadium?

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,900
Yeah. They're bringing him back 
for one more time at bat        

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
before the game.                

67
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,700
He wants you to pitch to him.   

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,900
          Smart guy, that Dutch.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
          He's gotta be kidding.

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,700
             Why the hell should
             I want to help him?

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,100
     I, I'm gonna get on a plane
        and fly down to New York

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
                just to give him
            some free publicity?

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you worried about?     

74
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,900
You afraid he's                 
gonna pop one out               

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,800
and you're going to have to see 
the old Dutch Windmill again?   

76
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,600
  What is the Dutch Windmill?   

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
                  Oh, every time
              Dutch hit a homer,

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
 he used to do this little dance
  while he ran around the bases.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
     It's kind of his trademark.

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah, if memory serves,         

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,700
it was something like this.     

82
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,800
He'd have that                  
left arm pumping,               

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,300
and the right arm               
like a windmill,                

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,900
and wiggle his fanny            
back and forth.                 

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
                        NORM:   
                     No, no, no,

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,100
                 more like this.

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,300
     No, Norm, less jiggle.     

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
            I haven't started   
                    dancing yet.

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
Hey, this is fun.               

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,000
    Did you have                
    a trademark, Sam?           

91
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,700
                     Shut up and
                 leave me alone.

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,400
     Actually, Sam, that's      
        more of a motto.        

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,600
No, come on, man, don't         
let him lick your... Ew!        

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't let him lick              
your lips like that.            

95
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
             Oh, it's okay.     

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,300
    You know, it's an           
        interesting fact        

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,900
        that that dog's mouth   
             is probably cleaner

98
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,200
     than anybody's in this bar.

99
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,500
                There's a shock.

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,800
Fras, how about you?            
You want to play                
with the puppy?                 

101
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,400
         I don't know.          

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
 Uh, my mother never allowed me 

103
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
        to have a puppy         
    when I was a boy.           

104
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,100
  Consequently, she instilled   
in me a slight fear of animals. 

105
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,700
    I'd say it's about time     
    you got over that.          

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
        Come on, now, Spotty.   

107
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
         I want you to say hello
          to your Uncle Frasier.

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,800
Well, hello, Spotty.            

109
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,700
Norm, I, I think Spotty         
wants to go away now.           

110
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,200
             No. He feels pretty
  comfortable there, doesn't he?

111
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,400
Well, did I mention to          
you that, uh, Spotty            
wants to buy you a beer?        

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,300
    Good boy, Scotty.           

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,700
        Can I help you?         

114
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,300
Yeah. I'm looking for           
a yellow-bellied,               

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,600
runny-nosed has-been.           

116
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,500
                 Hmm, can't make
                one of those.   

117
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
              I'm out of cassis.

118
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,400
         Hello, Dutch.          

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,200
            Mayday.             

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
    What are you doing here?    

121
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,400
I hear you're too chicken       
    to pitch to me, Fluffy.     

122
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
What's the matter,              

123
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,500
afraid I'll make you            
look bad again?                 

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,800
                  I'm not afraid
             of anything, Dutch.

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,700
    And I don't have anything   
            to prove, either.   

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
     Hey, you know, Malone,     
        if word gets out        

127
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,500
      that you're pitching      
          to me again,          

128
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,200
it might give the guy           
the kind of publicity           

129
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
that would put him back         
in the public eye.              

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
Maybe even in the Hall of Fame. 

131
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,400
                  Oh, get out.  

132
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
            I could never get   
          into the Hall of Fame.

133
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,800
    Not you, you pantywaist.    

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,500
It's Dutch Kincaid Day,         
not Sam Malone Day.             

135
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,600
    Man, what an ego.           

136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,800
     Find yourself another      
    sucker, will you?           

137
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
             Okay.              

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,100
Have you got a men's room       
            in here?            

139
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,600
 Oh, what am I asking you for?  

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,500
            It's in the back.   

141
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,400
         Yeah, thanks.          

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,500
Oh, uh, I gave my neighbor's kid
a Sam Malone baseball card      

143
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
     to stick in his spokes     
          of his bike.          

144
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,700
 Now, when he rides it, it goes 
"wimp, wimp, wimp, wimp, wimp." 

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,800
                 Come on, Sammy,
                    let's go.   

146
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,600
            It would be great to
            see you pitch again.

147
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,400
No way. I told him "no"         
and I meant it.                 

148
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,500
     Come on, the guy is a jerk.

149
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,900
         You've got to nail him.
            No.                 

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,100
      Knock him down a few pegs.

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
No. No-no-no.                   

152
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,500
                  Oh, no.       

153
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,700
        You're afraid he's still
    gonna be able to hit you.   

154
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,100
Oh, are you kidding me?         

155
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,100
The guy's a washed-up           
old has-been.                   

156
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
I mean, he hasn't               
played for years.               

157
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,200
I can strike him out with one   
hand tied behind my back.       

158
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
             Worth a try, Sammy.

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,300
     The other way never worked.

160
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,200
That was then, you know.        

161
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,200
Now I've got the edge on him.   

162
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm young. You know,            
I'm in good shape.              

163
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,400
    Aw, shoot.                  

164
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,100
I've got to remember            
to warm up before I do that.    

165
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,000
                So why don't you
            just go out there   

166
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,700
            and humiliate him   
                for a change?   
                        Yeah.   

167
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,500
                 Come on, Sammy.
          Yeah, Sammy.          

168
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,900
Listen to yourselves, will ya?  

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
Have some class.                

170
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,400
The guy's an old man.           

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,500
                        FRASIER:
              Good for you, Sam.

172
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
  I'm impressed by your stand.  

173
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,900
    It shows real maturity.     

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Yeah, well, it's gonna take a  
 lot more than a stupid insult  

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,100
  to get me to go all the way   
          to New York.          

176
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,300
I'll see you later, Underpants. 

177
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,000
         That does it!          

178
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,500
                 All right, I'll
            see you Saturday.   

179
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,900
    Yankee Stadium.             

180
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,200
    That's the spirit.          

181
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
 Listen, and don't worry about  
getting into the stadium.       

182
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,100
    Saturday is Ladies Day.     

183
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,100
                               

184
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,200
                               

185
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,600
  That'll teach you to pinch a  
 lady's butt in a locker room.  

186
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
                     Guys giving
                    you trouble?

187
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,500
              No.               

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,200
I was teaching them how to pinch
a lady's butt in a locker room. 

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,300
            Ah, look at this.   

190
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,400
                I'm focused, I'm
             psyched, I'm sober.

191
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
        Hey, Dutch doesn't stand
                 a chance today?

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
        Yeah.                   

193
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
                  Only one thing
                missing, huh?   

194
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
    I know, Sam.                

195
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,700
                    Yeah, I wish
                Coach were here.

196
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,400
        He is.                  

197
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,600
        ANNOUNCER:              
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
         welcome to...          

198
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,000
Call me sentimental, but doesn't
this bring back the old days?   

199
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
                    Yeah.       

200
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,000
I want you to get               
out there, Sammy,               

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,900
grind him into a raw,           
meaty pulp,                     

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,400
spread him on home plate        
and slide into his guts.        

203
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
(sobbing):                      
I've got to get a Kleenex.      

204
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,300
        Hey, Sam Malone.        

205
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,200
             Yeah.              

206
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,500
                Cap Richards.   

207
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,100
                     I'm Dutch's
            personal manager.   

208
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
                I cooked up this
                    whole thing.

209
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
             Glad I got a chance
                 to talk to you.

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,900
                  Uh, here's how
                it's gonna work.

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
     Throw the first two pitches
            however you want.   

212
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,100
          The third one, though,
    just float it across home   
        plate, nice and easy.   

213
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,500
        Oh, what?               
    Yeah, I thought the home run
          would be more dramatic

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,600
             on the third pitch.

215
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
        But if you want to do it
             on the first pitch,

216
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,900
     like you used to, go ahead.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,500
    You've gotta be kidding.    

218
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Sam Malone does not take a dive.

219
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,300
Yeah, I came down here          
to strike this guy out          
and that's what I'm gonna do.   

220
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
 You know, if he wants to get a 
hit, he's gonna have to earn it.

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
         Whoa, this is not good.

222
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,300
We have a special ceremony      
         in honor of...         

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,100
            You ready, Sammy?   
        Yeah.                   

224
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,400
    ...Dutch Kincaid.           

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,600
    I can strike this           
    guy out, can't I?           

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
    Of course you can.          

227
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,700
                         Listen,

228
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,600
      this is your chance       
  to make up for the old days.  

229
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,100
      It's the last thing       
  anyone's ever gonna remember  

230
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,900
about Sammy Mayday Malone-- that
  he struck out Dutch Kincaid.  

231
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,600
             Now go on out there
    and smoke three fast ones   

232
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
        past that lousy         
      flat-headed bastard.      

233
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,300
        (sobbing):              
 I need to get another Kleenex. 

234
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
        Yeah? Huh?              

235
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
            Oh.                 

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
                      Excuse me,

237
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,900
      are you Sam Malone?       

238
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,100
             Yeah.              

239
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,500
Yeah. Wh-wh-what's your name?   

240
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,400
             Billy Kincaid.     
How do you do, Billy?           

241
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,100
Oh, now you wouldn't,           
you wouldn't be a relation      

242
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,400
to Dutch Kincaid would you?     

243
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,800
        He's my grandpa.        

244
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,700
              I've heard all his
              neat stories about

245
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,500
    how you used to help him    
hit those long home runs.       

246
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,300
                     I never got
             to see one, though.

247
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,200
I sure hope I can see one today.

248
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,100
I may have to                   
disappoint you there.           

249
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,000
     This is the last time      
 Grandpa's ever going to play.  

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,300
            It's today or never.

251
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
Go away, will you?              
Go on.                          

252
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,900
  My two brothers and my baby   
sister are all watching at home.

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
    None of us ever saw him     
        hit a home run.         

254
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,100
Give me a break, will you?      

255
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
    Grandpa told us he wants    
     to hit a ball so hard,     

256
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
     it'll go up to heaven,     
so Grandma can say hello.       

257
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,200
      ANNOUNCER (over PA):      
Now pitching, Sam Malone.       

258
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,500
        Yeah, all right.        

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
            Hey, how'd it go?   

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
    Great.                      

261
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,400
Need me to scalp                
any tickets?                    

262
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,500
             No, no, you've done
            enough for today.   

263
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
        Thanks, Vinnie.         

264
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,300
      Hey, you guys aren't      
    supposed to be in here.     

265
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,100
            That's all right,   
          we're with Sam Malone.

266
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,200
                         Mm-hmm.

267
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,500
We're his personal trainers.    

268
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
So you're okay down here?       

269
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,300
            (chuckles)          

270
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,000
                 We know our way
         around a dugout, pally.

271
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,400
Look out, Cliffy.               
Incoming.                       

272
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,700
     Boy, that ball girl's      
    really got an arm, huh?     

273
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,400
      Here you go, Toots.       

274
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,600
                     Aw, Norm.  
    What?                       

275
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,600
              Barbecue sauce got
            all over the nachos.

276
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
    Hey...                      
                        Hey...  

277
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,300
Hey, guys, did I                
miss anything?                  

278
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,000
    Sam hasn't started yet.     
Oh.                             

279
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,200
        Where you been?         

280
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,900
     Oh, I've been visiting     
        the other team.         

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,500
I ran into somebody I used      
  to get hot and sweaty with.   

282
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
    Who's that?                 

283
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
        The other team.         

284
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,800
 And now, stepping to the plate 
      to face Sam Malone,       

285
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,100
the man we all turned out today 
          to honor...           

286
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,100
         Dutch Kincaid.         

287
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,100
        (applause)              

288
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Boo-o-o-o!                      
                      Boo-o-o-o!
        Boo-o-o-o!              

289
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,900
         Hey, you guys, come on.
                The first pitch.

290
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,200
        Okay, Sammy go!         
             Go-go!             

291
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
Come on, Sammy.                 

292
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,900
      (ball thuds in mitt)      
Oh, yeah!                       
            Strike one!         

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,700
        Go, Sammy!              

294
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
All right, Sammy.               

295
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,100
     Look at him out there.     

296
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
                 Doesn't he look
              cool on the mound?

297
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,500
                    Oh, I've got
                    goose bumps.

298
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,900
Yeah, all right,                
here comes the stretch.         

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,800
  Hey, ram it down his throat,  
             Sammy!             

300
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,000
                      Sammy, oh!
Come on, Sammy!                 

301
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,900
      (ball thuds in mitt)      
Oh, yeah!                       
            Strike two!         

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,700
        (wild cheering)         
Oh, yeah!                       

303
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,500
                    Bring on the
                    heat, Sammy!

304
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,300
                    He can't hit
              what he can't see!

305
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,700
          (loud crack)          

306
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400
Apparently,                     
he saw that one.                

307
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,000
        ANNOUNCER:              
     Look at that ball go.      

308
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,600
          It may clear          
    the center field fence.     

309
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,500
    It's going, going,          
    it's out of here!           

310
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,200
        (crowd cheering)        

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,200
          Poor Sammy.           

312
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,700
 Wow, he must feel lousy, huh?  

313
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
         Yeah, he's really gonna
            need our support.   

314
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, we'll just have           
to be really nice to him.       

315
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,700
We can sneak out of here.       

316
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,700
    I know a shortcut           
      through the showers.      

317
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,700
Better yet.                     

318
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,100
                    Too late.   

319
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,500
                He's seen us.   

320
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
             Okay.              

321
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,800
  I know what you're thinking.  

322
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,600
        But I can explain it.   

323
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,600
                I know it looked
                like a home run.

324
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,700
Yeah, our first clue            
was when the ball               

325
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,700
actually left the stadium.      

326
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah, but it doesn't count      
  'cause I did it on purpose.   

327
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
                      All right.

328
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,500
                  Oh, sure, Sam.

329
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,800
You let him get a home run      
      off you on purpose.       

330
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,500
            No, no.             

331
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,600
I did it for Kincaid's grandkid.

332
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,000
He wanted to see his grandfather
     hit a home run, so...      

333
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,300
Well, hell, he can              
explain it to you.              

334
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Billy.                          

335
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,800
        Yo, hey, Billy!         

336
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
        Oh, right, Sam.         

337
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,100
    Whatever you say.           

338
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
We believe you.                 

339
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
                     Why are you
            using that voice?   

340
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
            That's your "I don't
             believe you" voice.

341
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,700
No it's not, Sam.               
I do believe you.               

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,600
                Then why are you
                still talking...

343
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
            Oh, come on, listen,
Billy'll tell you everything.   

344
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
                     Hey, Billy!

345
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,800
                 Come on, Billy!
        Sam, Sam.               

346
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Come on.                        
Let's go home.                  

347
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,400
We get to go on                 
an airplane ride.               

348
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,000
 And maybe when we're up there, 

349
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,300
we'll get to see that pitch     
you served Dutch.               

350
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,800
                I'm telling you,
            I did it on purpose.

351
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,800
                 I swear to God.

352
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,000
     There was this kid...      

353
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,500
        Come on, Billy!         

354
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,900
    This isn't funny!           

355
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,900
          ...78, 79...          

356
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
              If you keep moving
                 around, Spotty,

357
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,300
        I'm not gonna be able   
    to get an accurate count.   

358
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,500
        One, two, three, four...

359
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,900
    Woody.                      
                        five... 

360
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,700
I guess you've given up         
on finding his owner, huh?      

361
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,400
     Well, why don't you want me
     to have this dog, Ms. Howe?

362
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,300
It's not that I don't want you  
to have the dog, Woody,         

363
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,200
it's just that                  
I have this... this thing       

364
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,600
about being completely honest   
when it comes to lost pets.     

365
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,800
Okay, when I was                
ten years old,                  

366
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,500
I had this beautiful            
Persian cat named Princess.     

367
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,600
She only loved me.              

368
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
She didn't like anybody         
else in my family.              

369
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
One day I woke up,              
Princess was gone.              

370
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,500
My mom and dad said             
that she got out                

371
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
through the bedroom window.     

372
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,100
             The weird thing is,

373
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I could have sworn              
that bedroom window             

374
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,500
was painted shut.               

375
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
It bothered me for years.       

376
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,100
      Then as you matured,      
  you came to accept the fact   

377
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
 that it was your parents who,  
  in fact, got rid of the cat.  

378
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
        What?!                  

379
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,700
    My Princess?!               

380
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,100
They took my Princess?!         

381
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
 Oh, boy, me and my big mouth.  

382
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
    Why don't I just go down    
          to the park           

383
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,500
    and tell the little kids    
    about Santa Claus?          

384
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,100
    What about Santa?           

385
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,800
                    But we do   
            believe you, Sam.   

386
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,100
    I'm getting tired           
         of that voice.         

387
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,200
     You know, I don't care     
      what you guys think.      

388
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,400
          In my heart,          
      I know I did this...      

389
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,300
              ALL:              
      ...for a little boy       
and his dead grandmother.       

390
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,800
                 Oh, guys, look.

391
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,300
              Spotty fell asleep
                     on my shoe.

392
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,600
             He's so sweet.     

393
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
          I just wish           
     I was wearing sandals      

394
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,300
        so I could feel         
    his little puppy breath.    

395
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
         Hi, gentlemen.         
      What can I get you?       

396
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
          Just coffee.          
         We're on duty.         

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,700
    What's the matter?          

398
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
      Well, two weeks ago       
    our dog ran away.           

399
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
Cutest little puppy             
you ever saw.                   

400
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,700
    He's just about so big.     

401
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,200
      Today, Chief made us      
      give up our search.       

402
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,600
              Oh.               

403
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,500
     Woody, I think they're     
     talking about Spotty.      

404
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,700
Do you want                     
to say something?               

405
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
                        No.     

406
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,600
              Make them go away.

407
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Come on, Woody.                 

408
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
It is obvious that              
it is their dog.                

409
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,100
And give me a break,            
a Dalmatian,                    

410
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
the fire department.            

411
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,200
                It's a different
                dog, ratfink.   

412
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,900
            Just 'cause you lost
                your stupid cat.

413
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
            Remember when       
                he was born?    

414
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
        Oh-h-h-h.               

415
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,600
 We each took hour-long shifts  

416
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,300
     feeding him warm milk      
     through an eyedropper.     

417
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
Remember how he used to         
fall asleep on my shoe?         

418
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.                           

419
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,900
I can still feel his            
warm little puppy breath.       

420
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,000
            (cries)             

421
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
              What is it?       

422
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
            Nothing.            

423
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,300
            Go away.            
 Isn't there a fire somewhere?  

424
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,500
        Oh, the heck with it.   

425
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
I didn't want him anyway.       

426
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,900
    He's all covered with spots.

427
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,100
         Hey-hey-hey...         

428
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
         Take him, I didn't know
        he was yours, honest.   

429
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
                    Thanks, kid.

430
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,100
             Looks like you took
          real good care of him.

431
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,000
             Yeah.              
                You know, we had
            a reward posted--   

432
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
                a hundred bucks.

433
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
                Oh, I don't care
                about the money.

434
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,100
              I just want what's
                best for Spotty.

435
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,300
        Gee, I'm, sorry, kid.   

436
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,800
        Now, a ride on a real   
         fire engine might help.

437
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,100
We can't let you do that.       

438
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,500
            (cries):            
      I miss him so much!       

439
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
             All right, come on.

440
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
         But don't tell anybody.

441
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
             Yeah!              

442
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,200
            Hey, can I, can I   
                  run the siren?

443
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
      No, that would be illegal.

444
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
                        (cries):
          Oh, geez, Spotty meant
            everything to me!   

445
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,800
        All right, you can      
        turn on the siren.      

446
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
Well, can I wear your hat?      

447
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,000
It's part of the uniform.       

448
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,300
    Well, can I drive,          

449
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,300
                please, please?!

450
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
      Here, take the dog.       

451
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
         Take the dog.          

452
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,700
                  (crying)      

453
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,700
      We snowed 'em, dude.      

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
  Where's little Miss Malone?   

455
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
         In the office?         

456
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,800
Haven't you humiliated him      
            enough?             

457
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,800
        Hey, not as much        
      as he humiliated me.      

458
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,600
        Hey, Malone...!         

459
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,100
     Pull on your pantyhose     
    and get out here.           

460
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,800
  We've got a score to settle.  

461
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
                 Come on, Dutch.

462
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,100
You had your home run.          

463
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,800
    Why don't we just           
    leave it at that?           

464
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm not gonna leave it at that. 

465
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
                You deliberately
          threw me a cream puff.

466
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,200
            I don't need your   
                charity pitches.

467
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
I didn't do it for you.         

468
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,900
I did it for your grandkid.     

469
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,800
      I don't have any grandkid.

470
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,600
What do you mean, you           
don't have any grandkid?        

471
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,100
                Naw, my personal
             manager and his kid

472
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,900
              are always pulling
                      that scam.

473
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,800
        That's how I got        
    Dutch Kincaid Day.          

474
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,700
This was a setup?               

475
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,500
     I had a chance finally     

476
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
to strike you out in front      
  of a stadium full of people   

477
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,200
     and I had to let it go     
for a stupid, lousy setup?      

478
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,200
                You never had   
            a chance, Malone.   

479
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,400
              I can hit anything
            you can serve up.   

480
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,900
          Oh, come on.          
        Give me a break.        

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,700
      My first two pitches      
    went right by you.          

482
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,100
     Well, I let them go by     
         for the drama.         

483
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,000
             Drama?             

484
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
    You let them go by          
         for the drama?         

485
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,100
        You want drama?         

486
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,500
      I'll give you drama.      

487
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,600
Come with me, you, you,         
come on, right now.             

488
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,800
                      All right.

489
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,500
            There's still plenty
          of daylight out there.

490
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,600
                    Let's do it.

491
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
    Yeah, well, I'll be back    

492
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
in about three pitches, fellas. 

493
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Two grown men                   
settling a rivalry              

494
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,900
by throwing a little white ball 
at a wooden stick.              

495
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
How pathetic.                   

496
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,200
         Now, boxing...         

497
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
     that's a man's sport.      

498
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,700
    Punch a guy in the face     
    and scramble his brains.    

499
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
     That proves something.     

500
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,900
             Fras, you're coming
                  around, buddy.

501
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
        Thank you.              

502
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,800
    Hey, shut up, you guys,     
    Sammy's pitching.           

503
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
            (crack)             

504
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,100
          Oh, my God,           
 there's two moons in the sky.  

505
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
SAM:                            
All right, lucky hit.           

506
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's go again.                 

507
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,300
            (crack)             

508
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,400
Gee, he almost hit              
a helicopter.                   

509
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,900
            (crack)             

510
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,300
SAM:                            
Okay, 226 lucky hits.           

511
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,300
             CARLA:             
     Hang in there, Sammy.      

512
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,800
        He's old.               
     He can't live forever.     

513
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:16,869
