74
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,625
         did live together for  
         a year before we wed.

         that I now see it

            endlessly before me,

77
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,231
             until I lie rotting
             in the grave,      

78
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,733
     there's no real difference.

79
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,885
Now, Lilith, if you,            
your family,                    

80
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,804
and generations of your         
ancestors had lived             

81
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,591
with the boot of oppression     
on your throat,                 

82
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,910
would cutting out a man's heart 
seem that extreme?

             Now.               

127
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,460
EDDIE:                          
Oh, these look great.           

128
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,661
    Mm-hmm.                     

129
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,345
                You know, Carla,

130
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,047
     it's, uh, nice to see you  

131
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,349
         surrounded by          
         such a loving family.  

132
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,386
Oh, it's eerie, Sam.            
                     Mmm.       

133
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,487
I got a husband                 

134
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,821
             who does windows.  

135
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,990
And all the kids                
are out of jail.                

136
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,195
For the first time in my life,  

137
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,063
when morning comes around,      

138
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,132
I want to open up my eyes       
instead of my wrists.           

139
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,068
    That's beautiful, honey.    

140
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,271
Uh, and who knows, Ma?          

141
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,307
Someday... well,                
you can look forward            

142
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,741
to having grandkids.            

143
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,910
         ( <i>laughing</i> ):          
         Carla, a grandmother?  

144
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,545
     You've got to be kidding.  

145
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,647
No, no.                         

146
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,148
Sammy, it's true.               

147
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,651
         I think I'd like to be 
         a grandmother someday. 

148
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,785
I mean, get all the fun,        

149
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,087
none of the responsibility.     

150
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,189
Just seeing the little brats    
when I want to.                 

151
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,990
I think you're gonna            
be surprised                    

152
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,159
what a sweet                    
little old granny I'll be.      

153
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,662
That's great,                   
'cause I knocked up Annie good. 

154
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,396
What!?                          

155
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,466
    Hey, hey, hey!              

156
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,602
    Oh! Oh! Carla!              

157
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,271
Carla! Carla!                   

158
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,340
 What are you thinking of?!     

159
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,342
    I just waxed that table.    

160
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,210
         Come here, come here.  
         Come on, come on.      

161
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,878
             Get off. Come on.  

162
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,714
         Come here, come here.  

163
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,555
    And besides...              

164
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,423
        this is family business.

165
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,058
Let's, um...                    

166
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,194
         Let's talk             
    about this later, okay?     

167
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,363
                     ( <i>sighs</i> )  

168
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,814
So what kind of car             
do you drive, Ed?               

169
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,984
I thought you said              

170
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,719
you wanted to be a grandmother. 

171
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,120
                        Someday.

172
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,188
            Like years from now,

173
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,724
        when you've moved       
        thousands of miles away.

174
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,493
         Carla, please.         

175
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,232
I drive a Corvette myself.      

176
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,902
         How could you do this?!

177
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,805
             Hey, I'm going to  
             be 20 in two years.

178
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,041
                 I can hear my  
                 biological     
                 clock ticking. 

179
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,744
         Do you know what it    
         takes to raise a kid?  

180
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,613
Ma, will you relax?             
I got a job.                    

181
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,181
             You think you can  
             support a family   

182
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,315
         pushing cheeseburgers?!

183
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,950
Well, I thought                 
we'd all stay here.             

184
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,285
                 Ho-ho, great.  

185
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,120
                 More people    
                 in this house. 

186
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,656
                 I get about 19 
                 on the highway,
                 15 in town.    

187
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,927
     Whose stupid idea          
     was this anyway?           

188
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,564
     Hey, I was getting bored   
     sitting around the house.  

189
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,999
I thought this might            
give her something to do.       

190
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,000
         I'll give you          

191
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,202
something to do!                

192
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,771
            Oh!                 
                        EDDIE:  
                        No, no. 

193
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,739
    Carla, Carla, Carla!        

194
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,376
            Come on.            

195
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,644
                         Well...

196
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,112
     if this is the way         
that we are going to be treated 

197
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,048
     on the happiest day        
     of our young lives,        

198
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,484
     then I don't want          
 to live in this house anymore! 

199
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,887
                Anthony!        

200
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,556
     You should probably        
         come with me.          

201
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,842
    But we haven't eaten yet.   

202
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,577
     Your hair is full          
     of bread crumbs.           

203
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,046
 We could butter your head      
     and make a sandwich.       

204
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:55,250
I had a sandwich for lunch!     

205
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,518
Oh, go on.                      
Go, go!                         

206
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:57,519
Get out of here!                

207
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:58,988
Let's see how long              
you last on your own!           

208
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,555
I give you three days!          

209
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,658
Two, two tops! You hear me?     

210
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,161
                Carla, come on. 
                Calm down.      

211
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:11,466
 Sammy, you get 15 in the city? 

212
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,919
             Hey, so they're    
             gonna have a baby. 

213
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,171
They'll, they'll find their way 
         through it.            

214
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:19,408
     You don't understand.      

215
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,642
        My life is over.        

216
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,045
 I'm going to be a grandmother. 

217
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,163
I mean,                         

218
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,131
 I might as well wrap myself up 

219
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,466
     in a black babushka,       

220
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,001
     get fat and grow hairs     
        out of my moles.        

221
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,503
                    Oh, come on.

222
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,771
                     ( <i>laughs</i> ) 

223
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,005
                 You're         
                 exaggerating.  

224
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,542
         Do I have              
 to get out the family album?   

225
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,093
CARLA:                          
Oh, God,                        

226
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,628
     this is terrible.          

227
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,998
        Look at my life.        

228
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,299
    I never had a childhood.    

229
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,468
 I married Nick when I was 15.  

230
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,155
Never got to go                 
to the prom or homecoming,      

231
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,956
     to a slumber party,        

232
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,792
     to Fort Lauderdale         
        on Spring Break.        

233
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,061
     Or on one lousy date       
         with Fabian.           

234
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,999
     Now I don't even get       
         a middle age.          

235
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,301
 Go straight from grade school  
         to Granny.             

236
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,486
 I don't know what to say,      

237
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,604
                         Carla. 

238
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,173
 Just don't say anything, okay? 

239
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,490
There's nothing                 
anybody can say                 

240
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,808
 that's gonna change anything,  

241
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,210
 so just don't say anything.    

242
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:11,677
     Yeah, but, Carla...        

243
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,028
Sam, I said don't say anything. 

244
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,363
 Weren't you listening to me?   

245
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:14,914
         Yes, Carla...          

246
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,665
 I said don't say anything!     

247
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,166
     Nobody listens to me.      

248
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:18,717
         I listen to...         

249
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,437
Shut up, shut up, shut up!      

250
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:24,706
         Just stay away         
     and leave me alone!        

251
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,942
I'm going to my room,           

252
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,977
    wait for the angel of death.

253
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,603
Oh, here's one                  
of my favorite paintings        

254
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,471
of the Comuneros.               

255
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,640
It depicts the peasant army     
struggling                      

256
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,876
to push this cannon             
to the top of the hill.         

257
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,213
Later, they found out           
they were on the wrong hill     

258
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,348
and had fired                   
on their own village.           

259
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,686
These people                    
had no luck.                    

260
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:58,223
             That's fascinating,
             Dorothy.           

261
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,426
         Isn't that             
         fascinating, Frasier?  

262
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,012
         Oh, yes, yes.          

263
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:07,016
You know, these stories make me 
 long to visit Paraguay...      

264
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,551
         right now.             

265
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,974
    ( <i>hooting and cheering</i> )    

266
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,727
I hired you                     
as a temporary waitress.        

267
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,862
What on earth were you doing    
with your blouse off?           

268
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,330
                 Serving drinks.

269
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:22,832
This is not a topless bar.      

270
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,067
             What, I'm supposed 
             to get tips for    
             good service?      

271
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,069
             Yes, dear, that's  
             the way we do      
             it around here.    

272
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,337
Well, I'm sorry,                

273
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:30,673
but I don't beauties            
like these under wraps.         

274
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,140
             Out.               

275
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:33,508
Out!                            

276
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,878
 God, that is the fourth temp   

277
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,380
waitress we've gone through.    

278
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:38,547
        I hate this bar.        

279
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,549
Excuse me, Miss,                
can we get some service?        

280
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,017
                     Yes, sir.  

281
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,352
                         WOMAN: 
                         Miss,  

282
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,720
                this martini    
                is too dry.     

283
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,889
Oh, I'm sorry.                  
I'll take care of that.         

284
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,056
         I've had it.           

285
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,492
 Isn't Carla ever coming back?  

286
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,026
         I was not born         
     to be a waitress.          

287
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,595
         I was born             
     to manage waitresses.      

288
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,263
                    Oh, Miss?   
You'll get it                   
when I'm damn good and ready!   

289
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,034
            Oh, God.            

290
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,869
             Well, we tried     
             to cheer up Carla, 

291
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,571
                but I don't     
                think it worked.

292
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,473
 Yeah? How far did you get?     

293
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,141
                    About a half
                    block away. 

294
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,044
             She hit Mr. Clavin 
             with a rock.       

295
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,181
Woody, uh, would you have       
a little look-see?              

296
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,348
Is there a lump up there?       

297
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,916
                Well, let's see.

298
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,151
                No.             

299
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:19,388
                Gee, Mr. Clavin,
                do you pluck    
                your eyebrows?  

300
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,490
( <i>groans</i> )                      

301
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,460
     We can't get along         
     without Carla here.        

302
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,694
How can we get her back?        

303
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,496
    Uh, well, I don't know,     
        but let's start         

304
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,663
             at square one here.

305
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:29,998
                 We know that,  
                 uh, she's upset

306
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,567
             about having a     
             grandchild, right? 

307
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:33,268
Another round, Sam?             

308
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,370
                Coming right up.

309
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,405
             Table 11, please.  

310
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,541
Well, she was complaining       

311
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,943
 that she'd missed out on all   
 that teenage stuff, you know?  

312
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,345
Homecoming, proms, may...       

313
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,814
 What-What if we do something   

314
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,749
        to take her back        
     to her teen years?         

315
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:47,883
     Like get her pregnant?     

316
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,151
                         CLIFF: 
                         No.    

317
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,186
        That's been done        
         to death.              

318
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,890
W-What else did she say?        
What else?                      

319
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,158
             Uh, let me think,  
             let me think.      

320
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,826
            All right, something
            about a sleep over. 

321
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,061
                 No, no, I know.
                 Slumber party. 

322
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:00,062
            Yeah, slumber party.

323
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,063
A slumber party?                
                    Right.      

324
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,430
                Well, that's it.

325
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,799
             Why don't we just  
             throw the woman    

326
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,650
         a slumber party, and   
         that'll cheer her up.  

327
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,519
Recreating a ritual             
of youth is often               

328
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,821
just the thing                  
to get someone                  

329
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,356
out of depression centered      
on a fear of aging.             

330
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,358
I find it also helps            
to listen to heavy doses        

331
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,894
of Credence Clearwater Revival. 

332
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,764
                        REBECCA:
                        Great.  

333
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,165
             I'm gonna do that. 
             SAM:               
             All right.         

334
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,233
             REBECCA:           
             Just one question. 

335
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,835
             What-what do you do
             at a slumber party?

336
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,037
                Well, the phrase
                "slumber party" 

337
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,072
                would imply     
                that one sleeps,

338
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,342
     but somehow I sense        
     that's meant to be ironic. 

339
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,212
         Terrific. We're really 
         on a roll here.        

340
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,647
I have a patient of that age.   

341
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,349
I suppose                       
I could do some research        

342
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,751
             and help you put   
             something together.

343
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:39,835
             REBECCA:           
             Thank you, Lilith. 

344
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,069
                I would really  
                appreciate that.

345
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,437
                    LILITH:     
                    Certainly.  
Say, Rebecca,                   

346
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:43,104
if you're in need               

347
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,356
of some extra guests,           

348
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,757
I know a couple                 
of fun-loving gals              

349
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,393
            who could really use
            a night on the town 

350
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,427
                 away from      
                 boring old me. 

351
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,596
And, uh,                        

352
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,864
                 Lilith, you've 
                 always told me 

353
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,799
         that you found Carla   
         an interesting, uh...  

354
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,467
                 psychological  
                 case study.    

355
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,769
Won't you be lonely?            

356
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,703
FRASIER:                        
Well, it'll give me             

357
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,754
            a chance to be alone
            with Dorothy's books

358
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,990
             and a roaring fire.

359
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,946
                Well, what do   
                you say, Lilith?

360
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,615
  Big wheel keep on turning    

361
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,885
  Proud Mary keep on burning   

362
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,719
 Rolling                       
         Rolling               

363
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,155
     Rolling                   
             Rolling           

364
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,891
             BOTH:              
  Rolling on the river...      

365
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,527
You know, you don't often get   
to see them loosen up like this.

366
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,507
( <i>whispering</i> ):                 
Come on in, the coast is clear. 

367
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,775
            Hi, Eddie.          
Hey, how you doing?

how are you?

             There you go.      
                     Thank you  
                     so much.

She's in the back room knitting.

             Oh, that's a sign  
             she's perking up.

I don't think so.

It's her death shroud.

I forgot the marshmallows       
for the hot chocolate.

00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,300
     That's okay, we'll use     
     the ones for the s'mores.  

380
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,802
     Then what will we use      
        for the s'mores?        

381
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,337

         the s'mores?

the s'mores since we've started.

         No, I haven't.

we know you're down,

to deal with depression.
