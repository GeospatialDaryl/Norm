1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,085
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,953
This particular kind of granite

3
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:07,188
comes from Barre, Vermont.

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,623
Get out-
Barre? Yeah.

5
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:09,924
Yeah, you can take a tour

6
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:11,192
of their whole
operation up there.

7
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:13,161
Yeah?
Yeah, ask for a guy named Asa.

8
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:15,062
Yeah?
Yeah, you can tell him I sent you.

9
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:16,297
He'll, uh...
he'll do you right.

10
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:17,532
He'll set me up?
Oh, sure.

11
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:18,899
You see, it's got the, uh...

12
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,403
(both chuckling)

13
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:23,455
Excuse me, sir?

14
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,657
Hey, hey, yo.
Sir.

15
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,959
This man obviously
mistook the uniform

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,627
of the United States
Postal Service

17
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,396
for one of the common
valet there, Norm.

18
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:32,730
Now that you mention it, Cliff,

19
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,466
you know...
Mistake or not, though, the man

20
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,168
has entrusted a
valuable possession

21
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,103
to one who proudly
wears this uniform.

22
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,238
As long as that man is
in that restaurant,

23
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,274
I-I cannot shirk
the responsibility

24
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,242
he has laid upon
these shoulders.

25
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,910
What are you gonna do,
just hang here

26
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,841
for a couple hours
while the guy eats?

27
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,615
Norm, my friend,
this is a Jaguar.

28
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,783
Jaguar plus postman equals...

29
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:53,985
adventure.

30
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,737
Let's do it.

31
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:03,344

Hey, Cliffie, what you doing?

49
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,791
I'm filling out an application

50
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:23,992
for the Boston Marathon.

51
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:25,727
It's, uh, something
I do every year.

52
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,762
Wait a minute, you run
in the Boston Marathon?

53
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,831
No, no, I just get
the free T-shirt.

54
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,366
It, uh, impresses the
girls down at the gym.

55
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,568
Ah.

56
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,970
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you-you work out in a gym?

57
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,105
Well, no, I just hang out

58
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:38,206
in front with
the T-shirt.

59
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:39,473
Oh.

60
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,459
FRASIER:
Hey, listen to this.

61
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,794
According to the TV Guide,

62
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,629
they're playing
an old Red Sox game

63
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,230
on Play Ball later.

64
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,548
What is Play Ball?

65
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,350
Well, it's, uh, this show
on channel 58.

66
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,820
They replay
classic Red Sox games.

67
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:53,121
Hey, say, listen, Sam?

68
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:54,990
This is one of your games.

69
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:58,726
Yeah, July 14, 1975,
relief pitcher, Sam Malone.

70
00:02:58,727 --> 00:02:59,961
CLIFF:
Hey, Sammy, what do you say

71
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,613
we make an evening
out of it, huh?

72
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,180
Yeah, popcorn, pretzels, beer.

73
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,631
Gather around the old TV set.

74
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,518
All right, sounds like a
nice change of pace.

75
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,219
Yeah.

76
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,604
Yeah, what the hell?

77
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,006
That sounds like a nice idea.

78
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,057
Say, honey,

79
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:12,941
can you do me a favour?

80
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,025
Can you hand me the, uh,

81
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,294
baseball almanac under the bar?

82
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,698
Uh, I was drinking a lot
back in those days,

83
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,834
and there's something
about 1975 I don't remember.

84
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,069
What's that?

85
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,288
The summer part.

86
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:29,490
I-I-I don't want them
seeing a game

87
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:30,608
where I embarrass myself.

88
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,910
All right, here we go.

89
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:35,279
July... July 14, '75.

90
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,014
Red Sox versus the Orioles.

91
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,616
Red Sox won.

92
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,918
Oh, right.

93
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,218
I pitched three innings.

94
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,821
I must have been okay that day.

95
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,489
Good.
Yeah.

96
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,773
All right, fellas.

97
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,643
Yeah, let's have
a party here, huh? ALL:

98
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:51,111
Finally, you're gonna see
why Sammy's so famous.

99
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,264
Actually, uh,
we don't get the channel

100
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,266
that shows why Sammy's
so famous.

101
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,550
(all laughing)

102
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,486
(phone rings)

103
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,988
(groaning)

104
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,957
Cheers.

105
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,159
Oh, hi, Vera.

106
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:09,030
Uh, no, Vera, I'm sorry,
Norm's not here.

107
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:10,832
Can I take a...

108
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,800
It's an emergency?

109
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,203
All right, all right.

110
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,805
Whoa, you're not gonna
believe this, Vera,

111
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:18,016
but Norm just walked in.

112
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,307
(muffled):
Hello, everybody.

113
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:21,910
ALL:
Norm!

114
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,611
(muffled):
Why, hello, Mr. Peterson.

115
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:24,879
(mumbling)

116
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:27,014
(all laughing)

117
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,817
Hi, honey.

118
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,436
What's the problem?

119
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,038
What, an IRS audit?

120
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,756
No, it can't be this afternoon.

121
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:37,808
They've got to give you
at least three, four notices.

122
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,477
This is the fourth notice?

123
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,896
All right, all...

124
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,031
look, don't worry about it.

125
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,866
Don't... listen,

126
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,467
as long as you're
checking the mail,

127
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:48,803
uh, could you check
to see if the, uh,

128
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:51,072
Victoria's Secret catalogue
came in?

129
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,640
It did? Good, good.

130
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,408
Just... just hold onto it, okay?

131
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:56,944
And for God sakes,
don't order anything.

132
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,701
Hey, Norm, what are you doing?

133
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,602
Just getting prepared.

134
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,104
I'm gonna bury this
auditor in paperwork.

135
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,506
I got phony receipts.

136
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,874
I got a postdated diary.

137
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,210
I got fake mileage
logs, the works.

138
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,095
Why are you meeting
the auditor here?

139
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,864
Old trick, Rebecca: you meet
the enemy on your own turf.

140
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:20,218
Yeah, well, that's very smart
there, Normie, very smart.

141
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:22,420
Hey, let me give you
another hint.

142
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,939
Keep the authority figure
on your own eye level.

143
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,707
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, it intimidates them.

144
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,958
Really?
Oh, yeah, sure.

145
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,727
You know, whenever
I get stopped by a policeman,

146
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:32,162
I get out of the car
and face him eye to eye.

147
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,698
Hey, you know,
that's good thinking, Clavin.

148
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,867
And you know,
another good thing to do

149
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,836
is reach into your vest pocket
real sudden like.

150
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,438
Give the cop a good start.

151
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,906
That way, he won't
push you around.

152
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,909
Ah, well, thank you
very much, Carla.

153
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,413
Just planting the seed.

154
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:49,980
Take a look at all this stuff.

155
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,649
Just take a look
at all this stuff.

156
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,584
When she sees this,
she's gonna crumble.

157
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:54,786
Did you say "she"?

158
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,887
Yeah.

159
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,488
What are you worried about?

160
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,573
What do you mean?

161
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,825
All you got to do is flirt
with her a little.

162
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,909
(chuckling)

163
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,494
Right, flirt- me?

164
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,762
Yeah.
Come on.

165
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,932
I haven't flirted with a
woman since I met Vera.

166
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:12,236
Actually, I think she killed
the part of me that flirts.

167
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,505
Come on, I mean, you can do it.

168
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,541
You compliment her a little.

169
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,842
You sweet-talk her.

170
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,077
Before you know it,
she's putty in your hands.

171
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,245
Yeah, right.

172
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,247
Would you flirt
with an IRS agent?

173
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,249
I do it with the tollbooth guy.

174
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,225
I'm looking for Norm Peterson.

175
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:37,111
And you are?

176
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,963
Dot Carroll, IRS.

177
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:39,964
Oh.

178
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:42,266
He's right over
there on the corner.

179
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,768
Ouch.

180
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,204
NORM:
Ah, Ms. Carroll,

181
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,689
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

182
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,623
After all, I'm an
accountant myself.

183
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,343
And I should be interested
in that because...?

184
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,528
No reason.

185
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:54,895
No reason at all.

186
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:57,081
Is there someplace we can talk?

187
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,716
Yes, uh, the
office there, uh...

188
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,785
I think you'll find that
everything's in perfect order.

189
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,969
It better be.

190
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,871
I just spent two hours
with some horse's ass

191
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:06,340
who tried to play the old
fake receipts and diary on me.

192
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,508
Can you believe it?

193
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:11,512
Ouch.

194
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:15,566
Okay, fellas,
bring it on in here.

195
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,834
Put it over there

196
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,202
under the other
television, all right?

197
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,937
And plug it in for me.

198
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,289
What's with the big screen?

199
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,723
Oh, some channel is playing

200
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,125
one of Sam's baseball
triumphs tonight.

201
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,266
Here, see for yourself.

202
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,778
Uh-huh.

203
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,980
(Carla clears throat)

204
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,182
Sammy, can I talk
to you for a minute?

205
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,450
You betcha.

206
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,886
You know, about this game
that's on tonight...

207
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,121
Uh-huh.
Do you remember what happened?

208
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,689
Yeah, I won.
(chuckles)

209
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,226
Hey, Sam, this was in
your drinking days.

210
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,194
I mean, this is the
game where you thought

211
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,497
the Orioles' mascot was
a huge mutant bird.

212
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,484
Oh, my God.

213
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:52,203
Yeah, remember?
Oh...

214
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,054
Yeah, you threw a
fastball at him.

215
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:55,556
You hit him right
between the eyes

216
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:56,924
and gave him a concussion.

217
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,243
Well, what would you do

218
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,378
if you saw this gigantic bird
coming at you?

219
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,812
Would you just
let it attack you

220
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,247
and peck your eyes out?

221
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,300
Come on, it took you three
years to live it down.

222
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,769
I mean, you really
want these guys

223
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,170
seeing it all over again?

224
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,389
Shh... shh...

225
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,157
Sammy, all set
for the big game tonight, huh?

226
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,492
STEVE:
Hey, all right.

227
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,543
A big screen TV.

228
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:17,594
Hey, Sammy, we ordered
a bunch of pizzas.

229
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:19,880
Say, uh, fellas, hey, listen,

230
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:21,215
you-you-you don't
want to watch

231
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:22,450
that silly old game, do you?

232
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,285
Let's see what else
is on at 8:30.

233
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:25,786
Hey, here you go, look at this.

234
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,222
Magilla Gorilla, huh?

235
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,391
ALL:
Come on!

236
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:33,010
$500 to have your
nails wrapped?

237
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,278
Yeah.

238
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,515
Yeah, I have
a very low calcium count.

239
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,000
According to these receipts,

240
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,835
you had a lot of business
dinners with a C. Clavin.

241
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,839
Yeah, he's a, um,
very important business client.

242
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:47,241
I constantly have
to wine and dine the guy.

243
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:49,985
Well, I certainly hope
he enjoyed his three Whoppers.

244
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,013
I believe he did, yes.

245
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,517
Mr. Peterson, about
this work diary

246
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,719
from 1989...
Yeah.

247
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,605
I'd be willing to bet
that if I took this

248
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,473
to my office for an analysis,
they would discover

249
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,943
that the ink is not more
than 30 minutes old.

250
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,478
So what, you're
gonna try to penalize me

251
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,448
for copying it over
for neatness?

252
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,652
Mr. Peterson...
Yeah?

253
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:17,204
As an accountant, I'm sure
you're aware that the penalty

254
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:19,824
for defrauding the United States
government is imprisonment.

255
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,277
This conversation
just took a left turn.

256
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:26,196
Fake receipts, phony diary.

257
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:29,500
Mr. Peterson,
you are in very big trouble.

258
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,035
I can't believe I'm hearing this

259
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,953
from someone... as...

260
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:39,677
doggone it, as...

261
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,847
as, uh, as lovely as yourself.

262
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:46,133
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

263
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,820
Come on, just...
take a look at you.

264
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,657
You've got the...
sculpted cheekbones,

265
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,059
those smouldering eyes,

266
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,061
a voice any man
could get lost in.

267
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,012
You're not giving yourself

268
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,181
enough credit, Miss Carroll.

269
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,949
I mean, surely
I'm not the first man

270
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,517
who's ever said
these things to you.

271
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,437
I think I know what's
going on here, Mr. Peterson.

272
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,705
What?

273
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,690
I wasn't born yesterday.

274
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:12,426
I know when someone's
making a pass at me.

275
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,495
And let me
tell you this, buster,

276
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,063
you're coming on to an official

277
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,565
of the United
States government,

278
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:20,867
an auditor for
the Internal Revenue Service.

279
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,338
This meeting is over...

280
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:26,691
stud!

281
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,776
We'll continue this audit
in my hotel room.

282
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:31,345
Ritz Carlton, room 147.

283
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:32,980
Meet me there tonight.

284
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,251
And P.S.,

285
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:39,220
I play rough.

286
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:52,183
I tell you, as far
as I'm concerned,

287
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,053
you got it made in the shade
with this IRS chick.

288
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,889
Hey, not only do you
get out of jail free,

289
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,726
but, uh, you get
a little action on the side.

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,495
High five!

291
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,182
Nobody. Okay.

292
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,453
NORM:
Well, Miss Ann Landers,

293
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:14,522
are you happy?

294
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:16,624
I took your advice-
I flirted with the woman.

295
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,192
Now she wants to sleep with me.

296
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,527
What do you suggest now?

297
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,212
I suggest you keep
the lights off.

298
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,398
Thank you.

299
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,001
Well, I say,
sauce for the goose.

300
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,603
At last a male
is being sexually harassed.

301
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,672
Let this be a lesson to us.

302
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:35,509
I mean, how many of us have,
in our lives, in some small way,

303
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:38,979
depersonalised a member
of the opposite sex?

304
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,568
Whoa, mangos-
two for a buck!

305
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,154
You see?
That's exactly the kind

306
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:49,205
of boorish behaviour
I'm talking about!

307
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:51,925
Hey, Sam,
how's it going back there?

308
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,060
Uh, fine.

309
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:55,862
All I got to do is
undo these two wires,

310
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,731
and the fellows will
never see the game.

311
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,567
(electrical crackling)

312
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,038
(grunts)

313
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,577
Sam, are you okay?

314
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,612
I just remembered.

315
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,581
I fought in the Civil War.

316
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:17,618
Hey, you know, I think
you busted the TV.

317
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:18,786
Wow!

318
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,438
What happened?

319
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:22,423
Oh! Yeah, uh, I'm
sorry, fellas.

320
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:24,825
I was, uh, I was, you know,
trying to make the colour

321
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,594
just right on the TV
for the big game,

322
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:27,695
and, uh, something blew.

323
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:28,496
Ah, Sammy.
(men grumbling)

324
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,514
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.

325
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:31,682
But, hey, don't worry about it.

326
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:32,816
They're-They're bound
to show it again.

327
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:33,985
It was a hell of a game.

328
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,419
I was pretty good
in it, too, fellas.

329
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,487
Don't worry, Sammy.

330
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,721
We'll watch it on
the regular TV.

331
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:38,922
(cheering)
No, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,424
Tim, actually, put that down,
put that down.

333
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,042
Uh, forgot to tell you, fellas,

334
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:44,178
that, uh, I was working
on that TV earlier,

335
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,180
trying to get the colour
just right for the game,

336
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,916
and, uh, damnedest thing,
it-it blew.

337
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,519
It blew as well as
the big screen there.

338
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:54,855
Uh, I guess we're just not meant
to see this game, huh, fellas?

339
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,790
It's okay, Sammy.

340
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:58,959
We can, uh, see it
on my little Watchman.

341
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,863
Where did that thing
come from, Paul?

342
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,498
I take it with me everywhere.

343
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,199
You know, you can, uh,
run it on batteries,

344
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,569
or I plug it in the, uh,
cigarette lighter in my car.

345
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,370
Paul, you watch TV in the car?

346
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:12,773
I don't like to miss my stories.

347
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,894
Can I see that?

348
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,129
Oh!

349
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,493
(chuckles):
Look at that.

350
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,764
I'll be damned.
That's a beauty.

351
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:21,765
I guess you just...

352
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,934
Oh.

353
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,185
Hey.

354
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

355
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:29,573
Uh, Paul, I'll-I'll replace it.

356
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,075
It's $300.

357
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,327
No, I meant the beer, Paul.

358
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,995
Sam, Sam, your
behaviour leads me

359
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,396
to one of two conclusions:

360
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,332
A) You're trying to keep
us from seeing that game;

361
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,368
Or B) You've just suffered a
small cerebrovascular accident.

362
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:43,821
What the hell is
going on here, Sam?

363
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,522
All right, I'll...

364
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:46,590
I'm sorry, fellas.

365
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,691
It's just...

366
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,443
I don't want you
to see the game.

367
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,161
I made a real idiot
out of myself.

368
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,597
I was, I was drunk that night
when I was pitching,

369
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:56,066
and, well, I kind of got mad

370
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,036
at the Oriole mascot and...

371
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,171
well, I skulled him.

372
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,474
Sammy, now, are-are you
talking about

373
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,642
that-that big stupid bird

374
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:07,778
that used to dance around
on top of the dugout?

375
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,696
A-Actually, Alan,
it turns out

376
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,233
that's a man
in a bird's costume.

377
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,837
See, I just, uh...

378
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,806
well, I-I'm real
embarrassed about it,

379
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,475
and it'd mean a lot to me if
you guys didn't watch the game.

380
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,177
I-I-I don't want to be
remembered like that.

381
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,680
We understand, Sam.

382
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,015
Yeah, Sammy, all you had to do
was say something.

383
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:29,483
It's okay, Sam, really.

384
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,601
Ah, hey, thanks a lot, guys.

385
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:32,836
That-That means a lot to me.

386
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,104
Thank you.

387
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,440
Uh, Carla, give these guys
a drink on the house.

388
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,708
Thanks a lot, fellas.

389
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:38,775
(chuckling, chattering)
Thanks, Sammy!

390
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:40,311
Thanks a lot.
That's great.

391
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:41,945
Looky here.

392
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,614
Hey, Paul, you got
two of those?

393
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:44,948
Yeah, I always keep one charged.

394
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,885
(chuckling,
ball game playing over TV)

395
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,057
(dryer blowing air)

396
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,244
(dryer stops)

397
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:59,268
So, Norm, decide what
you're gonna do?

398
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,048
I know one thing's for sure.

399
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,516
I can't just sleep
with some woman

400
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,318
so she'll go easier
on my tax audit.

401
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,852
You know, uh, Norm,

402
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,689
I've known you for a long time,
and I consider you a friend.

403
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,923
Yeah.

404
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,293
And I, uh, just want you to know
that I got connections.

405
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,329
Might be able to make it
a little easier for you.

406
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,697
You mean people in the IRS?

407
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,048
No, prison.

408
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,484
Right.

409
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:21,819
Thanks a lot.

410
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,121
Of course, if I tell this woman

411
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,490
that I'm not really
that attracted to her,

412
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,926
she'll get so angry, I
will wind up in prison.

413
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,794
Well, relax, Norm.

414
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,663
I've been brainstorming,
and I've come up with a plan.

415
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:33,797
Yeah?
Yeah.

416
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,165
I'm desperate;
I'll try anything.

417
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,433
Come on.

418
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,785
All right, tell you what,
here's the plan.

419
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:39,553
Uh-huh.
I go to the hotel in your place, right?

420
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:40,988
I reach in,
flick off the lights,

421
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:42,389
say "Room service
for Dot Carroll."

422
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,259
In the meantime, I've got
a big bag full of wild squirrels

423
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,362
with sparklers
attached to their tails.

424
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:50,731
I drop them in the room.

425
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,998
They run around terrified,

426
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,534
setting off the alarms
and the sprinklers.

427
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,636
Okay? In the ensuing hubbub,

428
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,871
she forgets all about
her little date with you.

429
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:58,922
Trust me.

430
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:00,941
You think a cold shower's
a mood killer?

431
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:03,176
Try a bag of wild squirrels.

432
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:07,764
Thanks, Cliff, but, uh, you
don't have to go to the trouble.

433
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:11,168
That's all right;
I already got the squirrels.

434
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,136
Thank you, but no.

435
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,272
Okay, okay.

436
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,991
Hey, Norm, I got an idea.

437
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,192
What?

438
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:21,261
Why don't I just pick up
the phone and call Vera

439
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:22,396
and tell her what's going on?

440
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,714
Now, listen.

441
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,282
She'll run over
to the Ritz Carlton

442
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,718
and burst into the room
before anything can happen.

443
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,954
This way, Dot can't get angry at
you, and you'll be off the hook.

444
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:31,905
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,840
Then Dot tells Vera
how I came on to her.

446
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,645
Either way, I spend the next
ten years sleeping on a cot.

447
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:41,748
Well, Norm, you could get,
uh, someone to impersonate Vera.

448
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,500
Well, thanks, Fras, but I doubt

449
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,886
that Ed Asner has time to
hop on a plane to Boston.

450
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:50,090
Well, I was thinking more

451
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:52,993
along the lines of,
uh, a friend in the bar.

452
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,895
(scoffs):
Oh.

453
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,364
NORM:
Come on, Carla.

454
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:58,849
This was your idea
in the first place. Oh, no.

455
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,584
What do you say you
help me out? Come on.

456
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:01,969
Oh, and why should I?

457
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,771
You haven't left me a tip
in 15 years.

458
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,008
Frankly, I never felt
the service was all that great.

459
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,845
Come on, are you gonna
help me or aren't you?

460
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,480
Forget about it!

461
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,282
All right, fine.

462
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,083
Fine. I'm
on my own.

463
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:21,555
I'll just go over to the hotel
and throw myself at her mercy.

464
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,490
I'll plead with the woman.

465
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,559
I'll beg her.

466
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:28,546
I'll say how wrong it is
for her to force me to do this.

467
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,110
What the hell, it worked for me
on my wedding night.

468
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,598
I'll make this short and sweet.

469
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,600
When I say "go,"
you tear off my clothes,

470
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,235
and you can't use your hands.

471
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,423
Well, hell, come on in.

472
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,415
Enough foreplay.

473
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:22,616
Let's be sheet meat.

474
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,369
Did I tell you
that I was married?

475
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:26,853
(scoffs) Congratulations.

476
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:29,072
Let's celebrate
with a roll in the hay.

477
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,458
Listen, there were
some things I said to you

478
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:33,761
this afternoon
that I-I really...

479
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:34,895
Don't worry.

480
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,446
I'll be gentle.

481
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,115
Drop trou on three.

482
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,366
One, two...
(knocking on door)

483
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,567
Who the hell's that?

484
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,102
I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

485
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,904
CARLA:
It's me, Vera, your wife!

486
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,405
What are you doing
in there, Norm?!

487
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,808
You better not have
a woman in there!

488
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,293
NORM:
Honey, honey.

489
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,397
(gasps)

490
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,131
Vera, now, now, now, calm down.

491
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,633
Calm down, honey, calm down.

492
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:57,668
Dot, I am so sorry.

493
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,069
How could you?!

494
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,771
I couldn't help myself.

495
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,606
How could you?

496
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,642
Let me put your mind at rest,
Mrs. Peterson.

497
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,943
Nothing happened.

498
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,444
Oh, thank God.

499
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,679
Well, I guess that's it.

500
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,747
We'd better go.
Yeah.

501
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,915
Hey!

502
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,116
Aren't you a waitress
at that bar?

503
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,385
What?

504
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,586
I don't believe for a second

505
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,153
that you two are man and wife.

506
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:18,689
I don't know what
you're talking about.

507
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,457
I'm Vera Peterson, Norm's wife.

508
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:22,993
Okay, if you two
are so happily married,

509
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,430
let's see a big,
open-mouthed, sloppy kiss.

510
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:29,165
Right now.

511
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,038
We don't have to do that.

512
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,240
That's right.

513
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:39,076
That's for the privacy
of our boudoir.

514
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,895
If I don't see some evidence
of your happy marriage,

515
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,965
I'm gonna go through your
receipts with a fine-tooth comb.

516
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,487
Honey?

517
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:21,368
I'm sorry, Norm.
You're gonna fry.

518
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:28,024
Okay, Peterson, what's going on?

519
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,694
All right, Dot.

520
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,163
All right, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

521
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,132
That wasn't my wife.

522
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,735
My wife is probably home in bed.

523
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,838
The truth is, Dot,
I'm not a very good husband.

524
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:43,240
(sighs)

525
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,375
I hardly spend
any time at all with Vera.

526
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,210
We never talk.

527
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:49,380
I don't know her birthday.

528
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,847
I don't know
when our anniversary is.

529
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:53,133
But I don't cheat on her.

530
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:55,085
Now, that may not
sound like much to you,

531
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,987
but to me,
it's the difference between

532
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,923
being a bad husband
and being a bad person.

533
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,762
So, go ahead, d-do your worst.

534
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,497
Throw the book at me.

535
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,149
I should've known.

536
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,650
I scared you away, didn't I?

537
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,237
I'm always scaring men away.

538
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:16,607
What is it about me?!

539
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,093
Don't just stand there, tell me!
Uh...

540
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,331
(sighs)
You could lighten up a bit.

541
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,101
I mean, you do
come on sort of strong.

542
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:28,368
And while we're at it,

543
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:31,405
you could cut back
to three or four packs a day.

544
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,957
I do it to stay thin.

545
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,459
Want one?

546
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,665
All right,
this isn't about me, okay?

547
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:47,103
Oh, I guess I'm just
not used to somebody

548
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:49,439
saying nice things to me.

549
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,208
Well, I could start right now.

550
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:52,509
All right?

551
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,294
(sighs)

552
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,230
I believe that underneath
that gruff exterior,

553
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,433
you're probably a very
nice, warm, caring person.

554
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,268
Okay? And I say
that knowing that

555
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:02,902
you're probably gonna
throw me in jail.

556
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:03,887
(scoffs)

557
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,458
You're not going to jail, Norm.

558
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,158
I wouldn't throw a decent man
like you in jail.

559
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,043
Thank you, Dot.

560
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:17,350
Better head back
to, uh, Cheers.

561
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:20,136
Um, you want to stay here
and talk a while?

562
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,556
I probably shouldn't.

563
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,873
Got a minibar.

564
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:25,168
Well, if you need a friend.

565
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:32,849
That'd be nice,
just you and me, talking.

566
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:39,672
Room service for Dot Carroll.
