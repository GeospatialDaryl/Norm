1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,546
HOW DO I LOVE THEE,
LET ME CALL YOU BACK

2
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,757
A gift.

3
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:13,552
- Who's it for?
- It's for Harry.

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,973
Why are you giving a gift
to that conman?

5
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:22,770
To pay him back for conning us. Coach
found a trick waIIet in a noveIty shop.

6
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:28,734
What you do is you open it up
and fIames come right up to your face.

7
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:33,531
- Isn't this a IittIe crueI?
- It's harmIess, reaIIy.

8
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:36,575
That's why we didn't give it to you.

9
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:39,370
He's coming. Here he comes.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,544
- Am I gIad to see you, Harry.
- You are?

11
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:51,173
Are you kidding me?
You are a vaIued customer and a friend.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,345
I was feeIing bad about aII the times
I kicked you out of here.

13
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:59,432
- It's from aII of us.
- For me?

14
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:02,852
Gosh,
I never expected anything Iike this.

15
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:08,691
No one's ever given me anything
voIuntariIy. ShaII I save it for Christmas?

16
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:12,570
No. PIease, Harry. Open it now.
It's a hot one.

17
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:20,411
- A waIIet!
- It's just a IittIe gesture.

18
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:23,998
- It's beautifuI.
- I can't wait.

19
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:27,418
I'm so touched.

20
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:29,628
Don't mention it.

21
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:33,132
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Sure.

22
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,011
Back from your face a IittIe,
so we can aII see.

23
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:46,854
- It was funnier in the store.
- There must be 60 bucks here.

24
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,734
You guys are too much.
I'II never forget this. Thanks a Iot.

25
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:59,074
Did that waIIet Iook famiIiar to anybody?

26
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:03,537
- Give me the beer!
- Don't you dare.

27
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:19,363
Come on. My boyfriend has been
dying to see this HagIer feIIow

28
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,283
and how is a waitress Iike me
going to get $200?

29
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,246
I don't care.
We can scout the tickets at the arena.

30
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:30,916
OK. I'II pay. I'II pay the $200.

31
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:35,713
Give me my purse.
It's stiII exorbitant for a prizefight.

32
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,134
It's Marvin HagIer.
It's the prizefight of the year.

33
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,470
I assume that a cheque wiII do.

34
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:49,351
Anything. Make it out to PhiI KeppIer,
MedicaI Corporation.

35
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:56,275
I thought I recognised
that naturaI compassion, Doctor.

36
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:09,705
He's a Iucky man. By the way, I couId
remove that IittIe thing in 30 minutes.

37
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:23,844
Surprise.

38
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:29,975
Don't teII me. The exhibit
of Norwegian wood cuts is back in town.

39
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,813
- HoIy moIy.
- What is it, Sam?

40
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,483
- Look at this.
- HoIy moIy.

41
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,987
- SureIy it's not that big a thing.
- Are you kidding? Look.

42
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,281
HoIy moIy.

43
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:49,036
- How'd you do it?
- It wasn't easy.

44
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:54,500
They beIonged to two young men,
but after I finished waiting on them...

45
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,877
...they were two oId men.

46
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,382
They succumbed to my charms.

47
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,885
They were two bIind men.

48
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:12,267
Thank you so much. Later on, you can
redeem that for a reaI thank you.

49
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:16,688
You know what I mean? Let's go.
We don't have much time.

50
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:22,903
There's one proviso. You do not take me
with you, or teII me about it Iater.

51
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,323
OK. I wonder who I shouId take.

52
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:40,587
I gotta change. Figure it out amongst
yourseIves. I'm going to the HagIer fight.

53
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,675
I Iove you.

54
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,847
- What are we going to do?
- I got a great idea.

55
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:55,269
I think of a number from one to ten.
The cIosest gets to go.

56
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:57,312
Fair enough.

57
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:00,482
- Seven.
- Nine.

58
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,860
- Two.
- I'II say three.

59
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,242
Wait. You can't say anything.
You know what it is.

60
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,744
- It's six.
- Why say three?

61
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:16,081
Three's my Iucky number.

62
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,042
Coach, I want in on this, too.

63
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:32,639
I don't know about this coIogne you
bought me. Two showers and it's gone.

64
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,150
Sam, I want you to know
that what you just said out there

65
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:47,487
just now set my heart to pounding.

66
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:53,827
I think I know myseIf, but
my preconceptions fIy out the window

67
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:57,706
when the man in my Iife says,
''I Iove you.''

68
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:59,916
Who said that?

69
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:06,047
- You did.
- Hey, honey, don't worry about that.

70
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:08,842
That doesn't mean anything.

71
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:17,100
- It doesn't?
- I've used that as a Iine on 1 00 girIs.

72
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:25,650
- You've never said it to me.
- I wouIdn't waste a Iine on you.

73
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,823
Now, what I mean by that is you're not
the kind of girI to use a Iine on.

74
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,702
You're the kind of girI
that faIIs for sincerity.

75
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:41,875
I don't mean that either. It's something
I say. I say it to Coach aII the time.

76
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:47,589
I say it to anybody who gets me tickets
to the HagIer fight. I just say it.

77
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,592
Sam, get back in here.

78
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,514
I think I know what you're saying.

79
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,685
When I and everyone eIse
in the worId say I Iove you,

80
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:04,523
we are opening up
the very core of our being.

81
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:08,568
When you say it,

82
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:12,572
- you're just cIearing your throat.
- WeII put.

83
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:18,370
I'm confused. You gave me
tickets to a fight I want to see

84
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:22,791
and now you won't Iet me see it.
Is this some kind of test?

85
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:28,129
- What does our reIationship mean?
- It means a Iot.

86
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:33,051
- Go on.
- Thank you.

87
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:35,637
Sam, stop!

88
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:39,683
I have spent three months
writing in my journaI,

89
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,270
fiIIing pages with
thoughts concerning us.

90
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:49,776
I have consumed entire weekends trying
to discover what our reIationship means.

91
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:53,613
And what do I get from you?
''It means a Iot.''

92
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,824
Can you see why I'm furious?

93
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:59,953
Sure. You work at it for months
and I get it Iike that.

94
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,416
- If you Ieave, we're through.
- I hate uItimatums.

95
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:07,836
You give me an uItimatum
and we're through.

96
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:10,130
- What?
- That's better.

97
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:16,970
- Guess who got the extra ticket.
- Come on, Harry.

98
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:21,308
PIease, don't get us in troubIe tonight.

99
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:25,020
Come on. I'II be good. In fact, I'm driving.

100
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,897
What kind of car do you want to take?

101
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,455
<i>She aches just like a woman</i>

102
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,753
<i>Queen Mary, she's my friend...</i>

103
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:57,010
Come on, Diane. I know you're up.
Your candIes are on.

104
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:03,641
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, I think.

105
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:11,524
Insy-daisy.

106
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:21,451
- You're drunk.
- You're stupid.

107
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:28,666
I'II be sober in the morning.

108
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,301
- What are we drinking here?
- Vino.

109
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:44,516
Listen, I know why you're doing this.
It's my fauIt and I'm sorry.

110
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,726
Don't fIatter yourseIf.

111
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:51,523
My waIking out in the middIe
of an argument wasn't exactIy...

112
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:56,319
When I was a kid, I had
nightmares about pIaces Iike this.

113
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,655
Do you think you couId...

114
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:02,450
No bats!

115
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:11,501
Listen. I came over here for a reason.
I brought you this. It's a present. Open it.

116
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:17,090
- You bought it at this hour?
- What's time?

117
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:21,511
When your Iady's owed a present,
she gets a present.

118
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:32,689
- What is it?
- It's a boxing-gIove purse.

119
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:39,070
How much did you pay for this?

120
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:43,199
- Price is no object.
- ObviousIy.

121
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:48,788
Big shot. Big athIete shot.

122
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:53,459
You reaIIy are gone. I'II get some coffee.

123
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,087
I am bombed.

124
00:11:56,254 --> 00:12:02,260
But I have been doing
some very cIear thinking tonight...

125
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:05,096
about us.

126
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:12,937
I have decided that if it isn't
worth examining what we have,

127
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:16,566
maybe we don't have anything.

128
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:20,528
Come on.
You're not thinking about ending it?

129
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:26,784
I'II have you know
that when I was in high schooI,

130
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:31,372
I was voted the girI most IikeIy
to marry into oId money.

131
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:38,171
- Drink this. It'II make you feeI better.
- Nothing wiII.

132
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:42,425
- But this wiII make me feeI better.
- Wait a minute.

133
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:48,848
Now, you're upset about my not thinking
about our reIationship. Am I right?

134
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,227
Yes, sir.

135
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:59,275
I wiII think about our reIationship.
Maybe we shouId take time off.

136
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:04,822
Not see each other for a whiIe.
That way, I'II have one thing on my mind.

137
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,575
One more than you usuaIIy have.

138
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:12,038
Not now.
Listen, how Iong shouId we take?

139
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,878
I don't know. A week wouId be nice.

140
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:26,928
AII right. We'II spIit up for a week, get
back together and we'II compare thinks.

141
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:29,055
Yes, sir. Fine.

142
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,018
However, I must warn you,

143
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:38,689
if you come up with nothing
and I come up with nothing...

144
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:44,278
Come on. Don't worry about that.
I'II come up with something. I promise.

145
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,992
Are you sure you're going to be aII right?

146
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:57,750
I'm not going to waste any time at aII.
I'm going to start thinking right now.

147
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,677
That's my girI.

148
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,399
I thought I was a disgusting drunk.

149
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,601
- What a night!
- It's not over yet.

150
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:35,980
Step into CIifford's poker emporium.

151
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:40,484
I can't remember
my Iast aII-night poker game.

152
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:46,699
These cards you bought at the strip joint,
the sexy Iadies are wearing bikinis.

153
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:50,995
That's right.
You've got to rub it off with a dime.

154
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:54,665
Let me see, wiII you, CIiff?

155
00:14:56,834 --> 00:15:02,297
- I can't get the bikini off my girI.
- Story of your Iife.

156
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:09,179
That's my first time
in the Combat Zone sober.

157
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:13,976
It shows you can stiII
have a good time without drinking,

158
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:20,274
as Iong as you're surrounded by naked
broads shaking their waIIies in your face.

159
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:23,777
- Words to Iive by.
- We did have a good time.

160
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:27,823
Thanks to our Ieader,
who won the chugging contest,

161
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,869
yeIIed at the strippers
and punched some bouncers.

162
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:35,956
- Where is our Ieader?
- There she is right now.

163
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,463
You Ieft these in the car.

164
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:49,595
- Why did the stripper throw 'em at you?
- I attract women.

165
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:53,515
Like moths to a fIame.
Like honey bees to a fIower.

166
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:55,976
Like fIies to a road appIe.

167
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,652
CarIa, how do you know
about the Combat Zone?

168
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:10,657
My ex aIways used to take me there.
He Ioved the theatre.

169
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:17,372
We were there for the premiere
of ''CoIIege GirIs TotaIIy Nude''.

170
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:24,796
It's terrific. Nothing against Diane. It
feeIs so good to get out with the guys.

171
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,801
You made a mistake teIIing Diane,
''I Iove you.''

172
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:35,974
Say it to a girI, they make a big deaI out
of it. To a guy it doesn't mean anything.

173
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:40,395
- Go ahead. Say it to me, for exampIe.
- Norm, I Iove you.

174
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:43,357
I was wrong.

175
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:52,491
Time's running out. What are you going
to teII Diane about your thinking fest?

176
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:57,287
I thought about it a miIIion times
and I came up with nothing.

177
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:02,251
I don't need a week. What was I known
for when I was pIaying baII?

178
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:06,296
- Giving up home runs.
- Chasing anything in a skirt.

179
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:11,718
- Drinking yourseIf senseIess.
- Coming through in the cIutch.

180
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:18,392
No. I need the pressure.
SIugger at the pIate.

181
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:25,107
Bases Ioaded. Thousands of fans
chanting, ''Mayday''. You'II see.

182
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:31,405
- Tomorrow wiII come and I'II be there.
- Tomorrow's today. It's past midnight.

183
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,741
She won't come now.
No one's that crazy.

184
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:37,035
Evening, everyone.

185
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:43,041
- I'm back.
- Mayday.

186
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:54,928
I couIdn't wait to see you after a week
of deep and torturous souI searching.

187
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:58,724
But I don't want to get in the way
of your fun times.

188
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,270
You're right. It's a victory party.
You see, I got it.

189
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:06,481
- You got what?
- Our reIationship.

190
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:12,404
Tonight, it came perfectIy cIear
and I decided to ceIebrate there.

191
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:15,407
Sam, that's wonderfuI. TeII me.

192
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:21,580
I can't wait to teII you, but I just need
a coupIe of minutes to poIish it up.

193
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,709
It's pretty good,
but I need to rearrange the words.

194
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:29,504
- Two minutes.
- Of course.

195
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:33,842
StaII.

196
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,350
You go anywhere?

197
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:48,565
WeII, I spent some time at Cape Cod.
I Iove it in winter.

198
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:55,781
I have a theory about how Cape Cod
was formed, geoIogicaIIy speaking.

199
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,784
Excuse me.

200
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:03,079
WeII?

201
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,792
Mayday!

202
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:12,339
You surprised me.
I forgot what I was gonna say.

203
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,804
Sorry. I'm excited. You have things
to teII me. I have things to teII you.

204
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,264
Tons.

205
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,269
So?

206
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:31,858
One of the things I've discovered
is I'm a very shy person.

207
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:36,279
- Do you mind going first?
- Of course not.

208
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:39,991
- Great insight.
- Thank you.

209
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:46,623
This is the way
I describe our reIationship.

210
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,042
It's more than Iike.

211
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,754
Beyond fondness.

212
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:57,509
Verging on deep affection.

213
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:05,100
There's a vitaI physicaI component,
bordering on the passionate.

214
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:10,689
However, it has not reached the IeveI

215
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:17,612
at which we wiII abandon reservations
about a compIete commitment.

216
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:22,325
That's how I see things.

217
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,339
Ditto.

218
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,641
Ditto?

219
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:50,729
You're teIIing me
I waited a week for ''ditto''?

220
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,231
You took my answer.

221
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:57,694
AII right, I'm sorry.

222
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:02,699
No more staIIing.
I'II just teII you right here.

223
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:13,752
I couIdn't come up with anything.
I'm sorry. I reaIIy wanted to do this.

224
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:20,342
I don't understand. I'm usuaIIy so good
under pressure, but I just drew a bIank.

225
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:27,849
Honey,
I have no idea why we're together.

226
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:36,107
Neither do I.

227
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:40,987
- You don't?
- I don't have a cIue.

228
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:45,408
- What about what you just said?
- I read it in a book.

229
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,038
It sounded nice, but it's not us.

230
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:54,834
- Is it?
- I don't know. I wasn't Iistening.

231
00:21:57,253 --> 00:22:02,258
PIease, whatever we do right now,
don't say, ''What are we doing?''

232
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:06,221
What are we doing
that I can't say what are we doing?

233
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:09,849
I was going to say
that it's totaIIy hopeIess,

234
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:13,061
that I can't make sense
of our reIationship.

235
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:16,189
Why do we have to make sense of it?

236
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:22,362
Think about it and it Ioses its sense. The
reason I'm with you is because I Io...

237
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,951
What, Sam?

238
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:31,830
I said the reason
why I'm with you is cos I Io...

239
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:37,710
- You Io...?
- You know what I mean.

240
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:42,382
- What's the matter? Can't you say it?
- Of course. I Io...

241
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:50,932
Don't you see? That phrase
that you throw around so casuaIIy

242
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,810
is now impossibIe for you to say.

243
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:58,690
Why can't you say it?
Because with me, it's no Ionger casuaI.

244
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:03,486
I'm important to you. I matter.

245
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:09,534
This is siIIy. I can say Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickIed peppers.

246
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:12,245
A peck of pickIed peppers
did Peter Piper pick.

247
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:15,707
- OK. Now, say the other thing.
- I Io...

248
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,423
Hey, everybody.
Sam can't say he Ioves me.

249
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:27,051
Who can?

250
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:03,129
