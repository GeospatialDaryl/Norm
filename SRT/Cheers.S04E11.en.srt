1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,790
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,159
- All right, 1 955 AL MVP.
- Yogi Berra.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,390
All right, height of the left field wall
at Fenway.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,314
- The Green Monster is 37 feet high.
- Told you.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,068
All right, here you go.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,119
- lke Delock's lifetime ERA.
- 4:03. Had enough?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,393
Give it up, Norm. The woman's
a lean, mean trivia machine.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,676
- Unbelievable. You're the best.
- I know.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,956
- Ask me something.
- Forget it, Zeke.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,510
There aren't any questions
about wheat in there.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,395
Oh, and I suppose you know
everything that's in this book.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,039
- If it's in there, I know it.
- Yeah?

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,236
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,835
What's the Library of Congress
card catalogue number?

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,276
Seven, eight, zero, three,
four, seven, six.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,029
- That's not even close.
- What do you mean? Look there.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,872
What?

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,234
That's it exactly.

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,075
Hey, everybody. Guess what
I grew in my greenhouse?

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,835
Not another potato that looks
like Richard Nixon.

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,634
No, I learned the error
of my ways there.

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,439
Yeah, I guess I was pretty
off the deep end then, huh?

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,115
No, but this is nothing like that.
Look at that.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,834
A map of the Hawaiian lslands.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,277
See the little bumps in the exact shape
and formation of our 50th state.

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,754
Come on, Cliff,
don't make me look, please.

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,913
Normy, Normy, this is one of nature's
fascinating little mutations here.

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,992
Resting in the hands
of one of her bigger ones.

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,037
All right, no skin off my nose.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,352
I'll just put it in the bag
and take it on home.

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,870
Hey, guess what's in the bag.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,275
"Human Sexuality"?

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,590
You don't have to broadcast it.

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,910
It happens to be assigned reading
for a required course.

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,310
You're blushing.

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,994
I am not blushing.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,559
I prefer to maintain a sense
of decorum, unlike you

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,474
who brought in coloured slides
of your wedding night.

39
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,998
They were a big hit.

40
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,996
And your break was over
ten minutes ago.

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,593
Oh, Carla, please.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,197
I have to come up with a topic
for my psychology paper by tonight.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,476
I'm at a complete loss.

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,313
Of course I could turn out your
run-of-the-mill essay

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,029
on sadomasochism, bestiality,
bondage and discipline...

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,634
but I'm looking for something
with a little pizzazz.

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,432
- Hello, everybody.
- Oh, Sam.

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,478
Would you please see if you can
light a fire under the stick?

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,039
She's been goofing off
for an hour.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,156
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. She's gotta write some paper

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,835
about sex and she can't think
of anything to write about.

52
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,794
You're kidding me. She studied
for a whole year at Sammy State.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,436
Hey there. I hear you're
writing a paper on sex.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,115
- Is there any way I can help out?
- Thank you, Sam.

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,556
This paper is on human sexuality.

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,597
No, come on, I'm serious.
I want to help.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,230
Well, it had occurred to me
to use you as a case study,

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,791
but I lack the proper clinical distance,
so that's out of the question.

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,995
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,276
You got an A plus staring you
in the face, here.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,911
Come on, we're pals, aren't we?
Come on, let me feel useful.

62
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,116
Well, you would be
an interesting study.

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,068
Great. Kind of slow in here, why don't
you step into my laboratory.

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,999
Well, all right. I am desperate.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,313
Sam...

66
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,835
...this has to be done
in a professional manner.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,151
I hope you'll take this seriously.
I'm only this far away

68
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,869
from a master's degree in--
Well, 37 different subjects.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,955
But if I do well in this class, psychology
could well become my major major.

70
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,915
Wow, and we were here, huh, Cliff?

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,875
We're always here.

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,912
Sam, before we start,
I want to warn you.

73
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,150
This will be frank and candid.

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,676
We may be touching on some
highly sensitive areas.

75
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,229
I like the sound of it already.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,595
Go ahead. Go ahead.

77
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,671
Okay, why don't we start
with your parents.

78
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,991
Would you describe them
as physically demonstrative?

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,232
I'm here, aren't l?
They must have been.

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,392
But why are you asking me
about my parents?

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,472
I'm asking about your parents
to lay a psychological foundation

82
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,234
- for your later behaviour.
- Boy, this isn't as much fun

83
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,870
as I thought it was gonna be.
When are we gonna get to me?

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,271
Okay, why don't we jump to your
relationships outside the family.

85
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,589
Yeah.

86
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,718
At what age did you have your
first sexual encounter?

87
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,633
That's more like it. Okay.

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,270
"Trevor, a Case Study."
Who's Trevor?

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,036
- That's you.
- You're not gonna use my name?

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,748
Of course not.

91
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,675
So I do all the work
and this Trevor guy gets the credit?

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,188
Sam, this is not your résumé.

93
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,638
In a psychological treatise,
real names are never used.

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,155
Yeah, but at least I should be able
to choose my own name.

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,754
How about "Duke"?

96
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,872
- This is my paper, and I like Trevor.
- All right. All right.

97
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,271
Let's see where were we? You wanted
to know about my first time, right?

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,273
Yes. How old were you?

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,830
Boy, I'm not sure.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,278
I know I couldn't get to her house
until the crossing guard showed up.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,514
Wow. First time is kind
of hard to remember.

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,717
- What about your first time?
- I'm the scientist, Sam.

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,270
My first time has nothing
to do with this.

104
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,114
But just to lay the subject to rest...

105
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,875
...it was the summer of my 19th year.

106
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,508
He was a young man in uniform.

107
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,591
It was a brief encounter.

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,309
He left my arms and went
to his doom.

109
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,439
Oh, no, he was killed, huh?

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,034
No, no, he went off to boot camp
and came back

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,078
with the most God-awful haircut
I'd ever seen.

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,118
Now, may we get back to you?
And limit your responses to attitudes.

113
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840
Please leave out the gory details.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,877
Now, what about your
second encounter?

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,952
Well, that would be
the crossing guard.

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,637
So, Woody, ready to take on Carla
in the sports trivia contest?

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,395
Yeah, well, now, I've been studying
all week long, so go ahead.

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,278
- Test me.
- All right.

119
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,030
In what game did Ted Williams
break his elbow.

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,396
Ted who?

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,389
I'd take another quick peek
in the book, Woods.

122
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,312
- Diane?
- Dr Greenspon.

123
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,630
What on earth are you doing here?

124
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,950
I just wanted to come by
and tell you in person,

125
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,556
I've read your paper, and I think
it is absolutely extraordinary.

126
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,392
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

127
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,870
if The New England Journal
of Psychology wanted to publish it.

128
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,192
Forgive me for losing my academic
demeanour for a few moments.

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,072
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,993
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love a beer, please.

131
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,549
Wonderful. Coming right up.

132
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,871
Of course I do have a couple
of reservations.

133
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,514
Well, the most significant concerns
your psychological subject, Trevor.

134
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,355
Since you seem to have found such a
near perfect example of Don Juanism,

135
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,036
there are bound to be those who are
going to doubt this paper's authenticity.

136
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,476
Doctor, I assure you,
every word is true,

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,358
although I understand your doubt.

138
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,115
It is hard to believe
that such a man exists.

139
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,191
Doctor,

140
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,590
have a seat over there
for just a couple of minutes.

141
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,513
I'll join you soon.
There are a few things I have to do.

142
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,833
- Sam.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,798
Would you mind
if I revealed your identity

144
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,428
to my psychology professor,
Dr Greenspon?

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,831
Mind? Yo, doc, Trevor here.

146
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,953
- Alias: Sam Malone.
- Lowell Greenspon.

147
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,035
That's an amazing case history
you have.

148
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,952
Yeah, isn't it? Knock on wood.

149
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,156
So you'd say that the paper
is accurate?

150
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,836
Well, now, we had to change a few
of the names to protect the satisfied.

151
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,513
- Well, it's been very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

152
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,911
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah. No, thank you very much.

153
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,632
What a find you have there, Diane.

154
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,870
So you really think it's publishable?

155
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,270
Well, that brings me
to my other reservation.

156
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,590
- What?
- In Trevor,

157
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,116
you've shown us the cause, yes?

158
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,590
What the paper lacks is the effect.

159
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,311
Now, if you could possibly find one
of these conquests to learn

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,835
why she's so gullible.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,878
What gives her such low self-esteem
so that she could possibly

162
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,430
fall for this blatant manipulation.

163
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,798
I don't know.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,748
Well, if you did, I don't see how
the Journal could fail to publish it.

165
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,791
Hey, Woody.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,230
Come on, buddy,
get your nose out of that book.

167
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,039
How much more trivia can you cram
into that head?

168
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,475
Yeah, maybe you're right.

169
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,837
My brain must be filled up,
because my hair hurts.

170
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,509
Why don't you call Carla over
before I forget everything.

171
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,989
Carla, you got a brash,
young challenger over here who says

172
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,390
he's gonna boot you off the top
of sports trivia mountain.

173
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,549
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,156
Well, he said it before and I've always
left him bleeding in the dust.

175
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,630
I say, Jethro goes down
in three questions.

176
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,874
Okay, everybody, gather around
for the sports trivia championships.

177
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,354
- Give me your best shot.
- Okay.

178
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,353
What was the lowest round
ever recorded

179
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,796
in a PGA-sanctioned
golf tournament?

180
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,670
- Fifty-nine, Al Geiberger.
- He's right.

181
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,035
All right.

182
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,988
Who was the oldest
heavyweight champion?

183
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,431
- Jersey Joe Walcott.
- Yeah. Bingo.

184
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,790
- All right, those were easy questions.
- Two for two.

185
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,758
You're gonna choke on this one.

186
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,314
Who was the only pitcher to ever lose
a one-hitter in the World Series?

187
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,438
- Bill Bevans.
- He did it.

188
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,431
All right.

189
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,431
New York Yankees, 1947,
against the Brooklyn Dodgers.

190
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,229
- All right. That's good, Woody.
- Goodwoody. Elmer Goodwoody,

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,231
shortstop, Boston Beaneaters.

192
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,075
It's all right, buddy, take a rest.

193
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,676
Take A Rest,
winner of the California Derby, 1 959.

194
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,198
Ten-eighty to win,

195
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,191
six-forty to place,

196
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,749
three-twenty to show.

197
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,593
- So you liked my rewrite?
- Oh, yes.

198
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,273
I just can't get over it.

199
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,319
I mean, who would have thought that
this "Colette" that you described

200
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,555
as "rapturously beautiful, intelligent,
indeed brilliant with an ethereal quality"

201
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,030
could be so easily manipulated
by Trevor.

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,388
Trevor is not without his charms,
crude as they may be.

203
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,438
Well, but they're so transparent.
The woman would have to be addled.

204
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,831
- She'd have to be totally lacking.
- Thank you. Your point is made.

205
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,996
Oh, hi, doc.

206
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,948
- Oh, my, is that the paper there?
- This is it.

207
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,111
You know, I still haven't had a chance
to read that.

208
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,316
- Mind if I take a look?
- You wouldn't enjoy it.

209
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,913
Oh, don't be modest, Diane.

210
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,799
I'm looking forward to your
presentation of it in class tonight.

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,757
- Thank you, doctor.
- Tonight?

212
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,593
Hey, you know, wait a second,
I'm the headline act of that thing.

213
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,479
- You mind if I sit in on class?
- Oh, Sam.

214
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,313
- You wouldn't enjoy the class, either.
- It's very dry and boring.

215
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,392
No reflection on you, professor.
I mean to someone

216
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,711
of Sam's limited intelligence.
No reflection on you, Sam.

217
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,475
What I mean is, don't you have
to cover for Woody tonight?

218
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,632
Oh, you're right. Darn it.
Well, too bad, huh? Doc.

219
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,756
Shoot,
and that did sound like fun too.

220
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,194
Wait a second, I've got an idea.

221
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,873
Why don't you bring them
all over here.

222
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,873
Kind of a field trip.
See Trevor in action.

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,709
We could hardly do that.

224
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,031
But I don't think some of the members
would mind coming by for a drink after.

225
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,272
It would give them a chance to meet
the clinical case in the flesh.

226
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,830
Oh, I'm not going to promise that.
We'll just see how the evening goes.

227
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,032
He's remarkable.

228
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,710
Sam.

229
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,429
- Sam.
- No, not now.

230
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,388
I'm going to prepare my lecture, here.
You know, it's about time

231
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,792
I gave something back to the sport
that's given me so much.

232
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,794
Sam, I think you should read this
after all.

233
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,437
It's not what you think.

234
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,068
If you change your mind
about the class coming here tonight,

235
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,198
call me at home. I'll understand.

236
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,474
"The Don Juan Syndrome
in Modern Culture: An Analysis of...

237
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,191
...Sat-- Sate-- Sater-- Satyriasis."

238
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,072
Oh, man, she did it.
She even made my sex life boring.

239
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,789
And not for the first time.

240
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,314
Excuse me,
is there a Cliff Clovin here?

241
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,992
It's Cliff Clavin, partner,
and you're looking at him.

242
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,799
Oh, hi.
I'm a reporter from the Chronicle.

243
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,110
You the guy that sent in this picture
of a squash

244
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,558
- with the Hawaiian lslands on it.
- Yeah. Yeah. What did I tell you guys?

245
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,632
This is one story
they couldn't squash.

246
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,154
There you go.

247
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,515
To be honest,
it's not the squash I'm looking for.

248
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,674
Actually, it's a part of a larger story
on eccentrics here in Boston.

249
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,751
You know, the lunatic fringe.

250
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,753
Lonely people desperate for attention.

251
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,478
Yeah, yeah, but where do I fit in?

252
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,030
You come right after the old lady
with the 84 snakes.

253
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,870
Okay, I'm insulted,
and I'll thank you to leave this bar.

254
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,835
They don't pay me enough.

255
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,119
Cliffy. All right,
you stuck up to that guy.

256
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,078
- You didn't let him exploit you.
- Yeah. Who the hell they think

257
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,559
they're dealing with.

258
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,917
I ain't giving my squash second billing
to a broad with a bunch of snakes.

259
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,789
Hey, how would you like to get a look
inside that old bag's head, huh?

260
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,159
Professor Malone, I think you've got
a little class in session there.

261
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,198
Hi, doc. Over here.
Welcome, everybody.

262
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,715
Why don't you come over
and take a seat anywhere over here.

263
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,873
There's no need to be so formal,
but if you have something prepared.

264
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,395
Oh, just a few things
off the top of my head.

265
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,836
Did you bring an apple
for the teacher?

266
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,548
- Sam.
- Yeah.

267
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,836
I didn't hear from you,
so I assume you read the paper.

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,752
Paper? Oh, yeah.
Couldn't put it down.

269
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,911
Are you sure you still want
to go through with this?

270
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,719
- Oh, absolutely.
- But, Sam, I don't feel this--

271
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,393
No, come on. Take a seat here.

272
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,917
Don't want to be late for class.
Okay, sit down.

273
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,912
Welcome, everybody.

274
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,390
Now, I realize you came here
to meet me and find out

275
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,394
what makes a guy like me tick.
So I asked myself:

276
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,154
"What makes you so different
from everybody else

277
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,629
when it comes to scoring big
with women?"

278
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,793
And I think it's--
I think it's this: I love ladies.

279
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,670
I love the way they smell,
the way they sound, the way they feel.

280
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,037
And by the way, that shade
of lipstick really compliments

281
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,794
that rosy glow on your cheeks.

282
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,311
- Unbelievable.
- Now, see, I'm not the only one

283
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,913
who thinks that.

284
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,514
Okay. All right, let's--
Enough about me here.

285
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,432
Let's open up this discussion
a little bit.

286
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,113
- What's your name, son?
- Barry.

287
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,554
Barry. All right, Barry.

288
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,157
Why don't you tell me what you do
when you meet a girl for the first time.

289
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,950
Well, I talk to her and I let her know
that I respect her as a human being.

290
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,236
I ask her out
without putting any pressure on her,

291
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,313
and I let the relationship
grow naturally.

292
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,514
Well, we all have some
pretty crazy ideas when we're young.

293
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,832
Okay, can anyone tell me
where Barry went off the beam?

294
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,840
Miss Chambers has a thought here.

295
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,394
All right. Well, all right, I guess so.

296
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,791
We can take five here.
Smoke them if you got them.

297
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,828
- You didn't read this, did you?
- Didn't have to, I lived it.

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,798
Sit down, please.

299
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,753
"Trevor is the image
of the arrested adolescent,

300
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,990
entirely self-oriented,

301
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,991
still intimidated
by the women around him

302
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,357
and attempting
to prove himself superior to them.

303
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,876
Through sexual conquest he can,
for a time, quell his constant fears

304
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,508
of inferiority and failure.

305
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,475
Indeed,
the idea of a nonsexual relationship

306
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,119
is completely foreign to him.

307
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,477
As the years pass and his physical
attractiveness diminishes,

308
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,791
he'll be doomed to a life
of loneliness and despair,

309
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,679
unable to give or receive love."

310
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,830
- Is this really how you feel about me?
- This is my clinical view of you.

311
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,230
As a woman,
I might have felt something different

312
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,470
than I feel as an academician.

313
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,918
It makes my life seem so cheap
and pathetic.

314
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,231
- Sam, you're reading things into this.
- Like here where it says:

315
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,834
"His life is cheap and pathetic."

316
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,348
Don't be hurt.
I hate it when you're hurt.

317
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,069
This is not a true picture of you.

318
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,472
I exaggerated in order
to corroborate my thesis.

319
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,358
Boy, I don't know.

320
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,795
Maybe I am gonna end up this way.

321
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,554
You're not listening to me.
This is a paper.

322
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,234
Theory and conjecture.

323
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,595
I was going for a grade.
I told the professor

324
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,432
what I thought he wanted to hear.

325
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,795
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

326
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,030
I mean, everything in here is true,

327
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,796
including the part about I've never
had a nonsexual relationship.

328
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,714
Now, there, that's a good example
of exaggeration.

329
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,030
You and I have
a nonsexual relationship.

330
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,428
How can you say that?

331
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,036
Well, I think that the fact
that we don't have sex is a major hint.

332
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,709
That's just because we promised
to try to keep our distance.

333
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,110
And we have.

334
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,114
Our relationship has reached
the mature adult stage.

335
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,589
Well, I wish there
were some way I could...

336
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,637
...prove it to you.

337
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,913
Well, maybe there is.

338
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,958
Sit on my lap.

339
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,271
I'm just trying to convince myself
that I can be close to a woman

340
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,034
without it being sexual.

341
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,432
- This is the silliest thing I've ever--
- Hey, come on, Diane.

342
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,359
Well, if it'll help prove something
to you, all right.

343
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,792
- Boy, you're nervous.
- I am not.

344
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,598
- There, we did it.
- Hey, come on.

345
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,957
Come on, you can't just get up
like that. That doesn't prove anything.

346
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,759
Come sit here, and let's just try
to have a normal conversation.

347
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,316
There is nothing normal about this.

348
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,109
- What do you want to talk about?
- It doesn't matter. Anything.

349
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,918
- How about the weather?
- Okay.

350
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,911
- Nice weather.
- A little nippy.

351
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,071
Well, that's because we're in Boston.

352
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,676
Now, if we were in, say, Tahiti.

353
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,035
- We'd be lying in the sun.
- Getting a tan.

354
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,954
Maybe even a sunburn.

355
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,829
Well, not if we rubbed oil
all over each other.

356
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,353
What are we trying to prove again?

357
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,353
Something about that I can carry
on a normal conversation

358
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,318
- without it being sexual.
- Well, so much for the weather.

359
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,914
- Yeah.
- How about music?

360
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,868
- No, we don't like the same music.
- Well, we can talk about that.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,470
- All right. I like rock 'n' roll.
- I like classical.

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,312
- Harmonies.
- Grandeur.

363
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,758
- The hot guitar licks.
- The strings washing over you

364
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,195
in a darkened concert hall.

365
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,430
The driving beat.

366
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,550
The low moan of the cello.

367
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,395
The drums, pounding,
pounding, pounding.

368
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,997
- But if we don't agree, we don't agree.
- Yeah, right.

369
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,958
- What's that leave us?
- Religion.

370
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,348
Religion. All right, the Bible.

371
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,509
- Adam.
- Eve.

372
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,069
- Fig leaves.
- Sin. All right.

373
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,674
- Okay.
- Well, I think we've proved our point.

374
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,195
Clearly we have
a nonsexual relationship.

375
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,793
And you are a fine human being.

376
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,916
- Well, thank you, Diane.
- So if you'll excuse me,

377
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,958
I'm going to go out there and tell them
my paper is completely invalid.

378
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,315
- There you go.
- Your knob.

379
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,799
Yes, I believe so.
