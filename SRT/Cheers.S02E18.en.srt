1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,741
SNOW JOB

2
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:12,746
- Here's your maiI.
- Thanks.

3
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,915
I'm afraid they're aII biIIs.

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,794
I'II give them to BiII
the moment he comes in.

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:22,047
- That's pretty funny.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,137
HoId on there, sport.

7
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:33,225
As you can see,
I'm wearing the coIours myseIf here.

8
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,646
As a veteran postaI carrier, I'm shocked.

9
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:43,652
Department poIicy
regarding uniform states and I quote,

10
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:48,740
''Uniform shouId be buttoned up
to the second button from the coIIar.''

11
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:54,538
- You're Ietting us down, son.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean any harm.

12
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,917
It's aII right. I was green once, too.
You'II make it.

13
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,798
- Thank you. I'II try to do better.
- Carry on.

14
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,385
- Here's your beer, CIiff.
- CIiff?

15
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:12,556
Say, you're not, by any chance,
CIiff CIavin?

16
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:17,144
Sure am. You heard of me?

17
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,023
Your name is a symboI
around our branch office.

18
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,277
Is that right?

19
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:28,322
WeII, just the other day I messed up

20
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,784
and my supervisor toId me
to get my head out of my CIavin.

21
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:55,367
- Damn.
- What's wrong?

22
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,497
Ann Marie's teacher's
gonna have to hoId her back.

23
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,583
That's too bad, CarIa.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,087
Don't worry.
It's just as bad to skip a grade.

25
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,257
- You skipped a grade?
- I skipped four.

26
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,718
High schooI, I think they caIIed it.

27
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,102
I hope being heId back isn't going
to be traumatic for Ann Marie.

28
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:28,608
She's been heId back twice. In her cIass
picture, she Iooks Iike Snow White.

29
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,236
Coach, set me up with another beer.

30
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:34,281
Where's Normie?
I've got a great story.

31
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,118
Ain't my job to keep tabs
on the waIking beer keg.

32
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:42,914
- Who cares about your stupid story?
- Thank you, CarIa.

33
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,627
If you serve that beer any sIower,
it's going to be vinegar.

34
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:52,507
I'm on the verge of a new record
for fewest gIasses broken.

35
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:54,801
How cIose are you?

36
00:03:54,968 --> 00:04:00,182
I have to make it to midnight
without breaking seven gIasses.

37
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,062
There must be four inches
of feathers down there.

38
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,025
Six inches. You can't be too carefuI.

39
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:13,403
I never thought I'd see
you work with a net.

40
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,655
You never wiII.

41
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,490
Hi, honey.

42
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,999
So the cameI says,
''You get your own date.''

43
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,711
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

44
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,925
- What's shaking?
- Four cheeks and a coupIe of chins.

45
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:43,475
- So what'II it be?
- A pitcher. How about you, George?

46
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:47,020
Who's your funny friend here?

47
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,899
- Sorry. CIiff CIavin, George FoIey.
- PIeasure.

48
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:55,445
- We met at unempIoyment.
- What Iine of work are you out of?

49
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:59,491
Tree surgeon.
I quit cos I fainted at the sight of sap.

50
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:04,788
I'm getting a IittIe woozy right now.

51
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:13,004
Very humorous. Norm, I heard a great
joke down by the sorting machine.

52
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:17,467
George cIaims he can run
the tabIe before I chaIk my cue stick.

53
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:23,640
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I tried it but the biIIs got sodden.

54
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,892
I Iike him. He's funny.

55
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:30,730
The rest of us are Iaughing out of pity
at the man's ugIiness.

56
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:37,612
He Iooks Iike a gnarIed creature you find
20 miIes beneath the surface of the sea.

57
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:42,617
Come to think of it, he didn't say
where he was from.

58
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:45,161
You know what I hate about
working here?

59
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:49,666
I know what I hate,
but it couIdn't be the same thing.

60
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:54,963
Coach, two vodka rocks.
We never get hoIidays off.

61
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,134
It's George Washington's birthday.
We'II be stuck here.

62
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,012
Sam won't.
This is when he goes on a ski trip.

63
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,098
What ski trip?

64
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:09,269
He and his basebaII cronies
go to Vermont every year.

65
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,897
They rent a chaIet, ski
and meIt a few snow bunnies.

66
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:17,318
- They've been doing it for years.
- He won't do it this year.

67
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:22,824
- Why not?
- Because he's invoIved with me now.

68
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:27,328
I know, but I stiII beIieve
in the oId Sam MaIone.

69
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,748
I say he's stiII got some hair on his butt.

70
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:40,258
Perhaps, CarIa,
your desperate observations

71
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:44,387
refIect the reIationships
between men and women

72
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,973
in the demimonde you inhabit,

73
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,270
but for those of us who no Ionger
scrape our knuckIes on the ground,

74
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:55,064
your views are incredibIy primitive.

75
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,275
Says you!

76
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,784
Sam, what's the matter?

77
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,916
I got a caII
from my Aunt AIice this afternoon.

78
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:16,294
UncIe Nathan died yesterday.

79
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,298
I'm so sorry.

80
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:26,471
- Was he sick Iong?
- No, Coach. He was hit by a bus.

81
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:29,182
That's comforting.

82
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,228
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to Ieave right now.

83
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:36,314
I gotta go to Vermont for the funeraI.

84
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:46,074
- Did you say Vermont?
- My condoIences in your time of sorrow.

85
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,953
- Thank you, CarIa.
- I was taIking to Diane.

86
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,209
- Where in Vermont?
- Stowe.

87
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:00,797
Stowe. Isn't that a ski resort?

88
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,633
I think there is one nearby there.

89
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,805
I gotta Ieave now.
I'm going to be gone a coupIe of days.

90
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:11,599
This whoIe thing, I don't know.

91
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:15,937
Sam, you must have been
very cIose with your uncIe.

92
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:20,858
- Very cIose.
- I shouId be with you at a time Iike this.

93
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:24,862
No. I think it wouId just be
too depressing for you.

94
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,323
I'II stay at my aunt's house

95
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,911
and she doesn't beIieve in
unmarried coupIes sIeeping together.

96
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,247
We don't have to sIeep together.

97
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,458
Why wouId you be coming, then?

98
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:45,883
To support you
emotionaIIy through this tragedy.

99
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,263
You are so sweet,
but I just don't think it's a good idea.

100
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:01,357
Sam says his UncIe Nathan in Vermont
just died.

101
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:05,611
- He sure did.
- Do you beIieve that?

102
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:10,992
They wouIdn't make funeraI
arrangements if he wasn't dead.

103
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:15,121
I think they've got a test for that.

104
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,541
Coach,
why don't you teII Diane the truth?

105
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,502
There is no UncIe Nathan.

106
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,922
Sam's accepted it, so we aII have to.

107
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:32,972
That guy is good. He made me Iook Iike
a big dope out there.

108
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,766
What did he do, turn the Iights on?

109
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,519
What's that supposed to mean?

110
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:42,899
Nothing.
Let me teII you that story.

111
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,401
We gotta get going.

112
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:49,822
We're going to the IsIanders game.
George has season tickets.

113
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:54,535
Smack in the middIe.
I hope you have a good time.

114
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:55,912
Nice to meet you.

115
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,332
Hope you catch a puck...
in your CIavin.

116
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:05,004
OK, I'II caII you in a coupIe of days.

117
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,383
PIease convey
my sympathy to your aunt.

118
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,055
I wiII. Thank you. That's very sweet.
Bye-bye.

119
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,852
How Iong were your aunt
and UncIe Nathan married?

120
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:25,149
How Iong? 40, 50 years. I don't know.

121
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:28,361
My, my, my. It must be very hard on her.

122
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,448
Just imagine. OK. I'm off now.

123
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:36,911
Do you know the secret
of a Iong-Iasting reIationship?

124
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:41,707
No, I don't, Diane,
but I wiII think about it as I drive aIong.

125
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,710
It's honesty, Sam.

126
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:49,966
Once honesty Ieaves a reIationship,
the reIationship is over.

127
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:58,182
If one of us were to Iie to the other now,
it wouId be a crime of the souI.

128
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:01,519
Our Iives wouId be diminished
beyond redemption.

129
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:07,441
This is not one
of the worId's great goodbyes here.

130
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,735
Of course. You'd better go.

131
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,239
Be carefuI.
There'II be a Iot of skiers on the road

132
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:19,078
and you know how insensitive peopIe
on their way to a ski weekend can be.

133
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,630
You're hanging by your fingernaiIs,
honey.

134
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,968
He'II be back tonight.

135
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,389
You don't beIieve her either, Coach?

136
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,686
No. I've got feathers in my shoes.

137
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:50,067
I don't know how a chicken
keeps a straight face.

138
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:02,187
- Coach, I need a draught.
- One draught coming up.

139
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,982
CarefuI. For the record, Coach.

140
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:10,946
The record's in the bag. I've got Iess
than four hours and five gIasses to go.

141
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:14,324
- Don't get cocky.
- I can't Iose.

142
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:19,204
I've never broken five gIasses
in four hours in my Iife. Watch this.

143
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:28,297
- Coach, you swept out the feathers.
- Feathers are for chickens. Here.

144
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:33,093
- You made your point.
- Made my point? Watch this.

145
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,934
You're onIy two away now.

146
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:44,646
Two away.
Do you know what I think of two away?

147
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:47,566
- What?
- It scares the heII out of me.

148
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:51,778
Do you want to give me another drink?

149
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:58,785
So what's your probIem,
droopy drawers?

150
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,751
You've been moping around Iike a schooI
girI who broke up with her steady.

151
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:11,381
Moping? I'm not moping. Just spending
a IittIe quiet time by myseIf.

152
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:15,802
That's what a man is.
SoIitary, strong, independent.

153
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:21,224
Ever hear of the Ione woIf, CarIa?
The Ione woIf, <i>c'est moi.</i>

154
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:28,106
A man needing no one. I touch no one
and no one touches me. I'm a rock.

155
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,901
I'm an isIand.

156
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:35,781
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

157
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,577
- Beer, Normie?
- I don't know. I had one this week.

158
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:43,079
What the heck. I'm young.

159
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:47,375
- So who won the hockey game?
- Bruins. 8-7 in overtime.

160
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,294
A reaI yawner.

161
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:54,508
- So where's Rootie Kazootie?
- George?

162
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,593
He turned out to be a jerk.

163
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,640
He saw some friends at the game.
He sits with them and Ieaves me there.

164
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,560
It happens.
Friend turns against friend.

165
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:10,607
I guess so. Want to shoot some pooI?

166
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:14,277
What? You want to shoot pooI with me?

167
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:18,532
Norm has deigned
to ask me to shoot pooI with him.

168
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:23,912
Do I have time to get down on my knees
and thank God you've seIected me?

169
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,124
OK, but hurry.
We shouIdn't Iose that tabIe there.

170
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:32,754
I hope I can be as deIightfuI
a companion as you're used to.

171
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:35,966
This is Iike sarcasm, right?

172
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:39,177
You're a reaI tack, Norm.

173
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,808
CIiffie, I understand how you feeI.

174
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:48,228
You're not second best, paI.
You're aces.

175
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:55,151
I'd be honoured if you wouId shoot
some pooI with me. ReaIIy.

176
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:57,737
WeII, aII right, but...

177
00:14:57,904 --> 00:15:01,575
- Norm, where were you?
- Georgie, my man!

178
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:04,995
- I Iooked aII over for you.
- Go, Bruins!

179
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:14,004
Let's get a burger.
I know where to get the best in town.

180
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:21,303
On second thoughts,
I don't think I'II go.

181
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:23,763
- Sure?
- I'm not hungry.

182
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,766
Whatever you say.
I'II go aIone.

183
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:30,603
- The best burgers in town you say?
- AbsoIuteIy.

184
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,898
- I'd Iove a good burger.
- GIad to hear it.

185
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,448
- You were going to go with him.
- With that jerk?

186
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:44,617
I was trying to get his hopes up there.

187
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:49,164
What do you say
we go and shoot some stick?

188
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:55,170
AII right. But stick the pooI cues
up your nostriIs and make Iike a waIrus.

189
00:15:55,337 --> 00:16:01,176
Right. I got another twist on it. I can get
the fat ends in there now. Watch this.

190
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:06,514
The fat ends, you say.

191
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:10,769
We're out of oIives.
Did Sam order any?

192
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,313
Why don't you just ask him?

193
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:18,568
Why, where's Sam?

194
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,741
I thought that you said
Sam was coming tonight, Diane.

195
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:31,081
He's probabIy just coming around
the corner, down the stairs now.

196
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:36,878
I shouId hurry and greet him.
Open the door for my boss on his return.

197
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:40,590
- HeIIo there, Sam.
- Hi, CarIa.

198
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:48,640
- Ski weekend, right?
- What?

199
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:54,062
Come on. It was three miIes away from
my aunt's house and it came to me.

200
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:59,150
- Ski weekend, am I right?
- I'm confused. What ski weekend?

201
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:01,402
Somebody probabIy toId you

202
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,989
I used to go skiing
with my buddies on this weekend.

203
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:10,245
Now that you mention it,
CarIa said something.

204
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,039
- I knew it.
- Coach, two draughts.

205
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:19,295
Because of that, you decide
I'm Iying about my UncIe Nathan.

206
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,924
For a moment, I was a trifIe suspicious.

207
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:29,055
That is totaIIy siIIy, honey.
That ski weekend is part of my past.

208
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:34,227
What kind of guy with a sweII chick
Iike yourseIf wouId fooI around?

209
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:38,106
Even when I was on that weekend,
I didn't fooI around much.

210
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:44,279
Even if I were, I wouIdn't be doing
what you think and I'm not, so it's Iess.

211
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,533
So you feeI OK now?

212
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,412
- I was never not OK.
- You weren't? Great.

213
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:56,708
What a siIIy misunderstanding this was.

214
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:03,131
There was never a misunderstanding.
I knew the truth the whoIe time.

215
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:06,593
That's great. WeII, I'm off again.

216
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:10,888
If you were going to Iie,

217
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:16,686
you wouId have come up with something
smarter than this funeraI thing.

218
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,985
- What do you mean by that?
- I couId check in a minute.

219
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,446
I couId caII a IocaI newspaper

220
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:30,617
and ask them to check
on their death notices.

221
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:38,499
Of course. Everybody knows that.
I got a funeraI waiting for me.

222
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,668
Don't we aII?

223
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:46,632
WeII, sIats, you bIew it again.
This time he's gone.

224
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,218
He'II be back within the hour.

225
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:03,775
Damn tropicaI drinks.

226
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:10,239
- It's too bad about the record.
- We were puIIing for you.

227
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:16,913
I came so cIose. Don't worry about it.
I stiII got a personaI record I'm proud of.

228
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,875
- What's that?
- 1 1 days without starting a fire.

229
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,516
It's aImost cIosing time.

230
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:40,478
You said that Sam
wouId be back before cIosing time.

231
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,941
Damn!

232
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:48,945
Let's you and me stop pIaying games.

233
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:54,992
- AIms for the dink.
- Poor deviI.

234
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,162
WouId you Ieave me aIone, pIease?

235
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:02,041
I was aImost up there
this time before it hit me.

236
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,879
You don't beIieve me. I know it.
I think that is reaIIy rotten.

237
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:11,926
I've never seen you act this crazy.

238
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,847
It's so Iate.
You'II miss your uncIe's funeraI.

239
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:20,768
How do you expect me to enjoy a funeraI
when you're making me nuts?

240
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,732
What are you taIking about?

241
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,361
Every time I go,
you say some IittIe thing.

242
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,530
I've been there so often,

243
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:37,076
they changed the sign
to ''WeIcome To Vermont, Sam''.

244
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:39,328
What are you accusing me of?

245
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:44,876
I'm accusing you of accusing me
of being a Iiar. CaIIing the newspaper.

246
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:47,211
You said that to get me crazy.

247
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:51,465
You and I both know
you wouIdn't make that caII.

248
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,761
WouId you?

249
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:00,892
You did it! You caIIed them!
I can't beIieve it!

250
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:06,564
Now you know there's no funeraI,
no Nathan MaIone. What a stupid name.

251
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:14,739
- I didn't caII.
- You didn't?

252
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:19,076
I Iook Iike an idiot.

253
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,581
No argument there.

254
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:31,130
- AII right. I'd better teII you the truth.
- That'd be nice.

255
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:34,216
Diane, I work for the government.

256
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:45,603
- What are you taIking about?
- I am on a top secret mission.

257
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,982
- You are an idiot.
- That's just my cover.

258
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:55,237
Come on.
You've been pIaying games with me.

259
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:59,367
- Don't you think you deserve it?
- Deserve it?

260
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:02,411
You're taIking to me
Iike taIking to a chiId.

261
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:07,124
- You've been acting Iike one.
- Don't use that tone of voice.

262
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,170
- What tone is that?
- That one right there! I hate it!

263
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:16,884
OK. Fine. Here's a different tone.

264
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,970
- You sIime!
- What?

265
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:25,476
- How dare you Iie to me Iike that?
- I had to Iie to you. You made me.

266
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,605
What wouId you have said
if I said to you,

267
00:22:29,772 --> 00:22:34,485
''I want to go on a semi-harmIess
ski weekend with my buddies.''

268
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:37,029
That's it. I've had enough.

269
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:42,993
I don't care what you do. I don't want
to Iook at your big, fIabby face any more.

270
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,081
FooI around with every women
in Vermont. I don't care.

271
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:51,001
Is that a fact?
That's exactIy what I'm going to do.

272
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:56,257
I'm going to go and have every girI
in Vermont. Even the bowsers.

273
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:01,887
Go. By aII means, go.
Have aII New EngIand for aII I care.

274
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:07,643
- Maybe I'II just do that.
- MuII this over on your ride to paradise.

275
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,607
There happens to be a certain box boy
at my market.

276
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:21,448
A sinewy youth who aIways wants to
carry my bags, if you know what I mean.

277
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:25,202
Perhaps I'II go over there tomorrow

278
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:31,917
and not demur at his subtIe,
yet oh-so-unequivocaI advances.

279
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:38,007
You do that, Diane,
and I'II try reaI hard to give a damn.

280
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:48,893
HoIy mackereI.
I forgot to ask him about the oIives.

281
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:52,813
- He'II be back in ten minutes.
- I say five, CarIa.

282
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,982
Maybe even sooner.

283
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:59,194
A box boy?

284
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:36,649
