we had quite a thing            
going there a while ago.

( <i>laughing</i> )

154
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,300
Would you...?

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
This is <i>not</i> funny.

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,100
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,400
You sure it's yours?

158
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,200
No, it's between me       
        and another guy.

159
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,500
But the kid's a real looker,

160
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,700
so, you know,          
    you figure it out.

161
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,900
So when are you         
      gonna find out, Dad?

162
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,000
Soon.

163
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,000
I mean, she dragged me down   
            to a lab

164
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
to have a blood test.

165
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,400
Well, what's                    
the big deal, you know?

166
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,200
You can just do                 
what all the other jerks do.

167
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
You pay a little money          
for support,

168
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,000
and you get off the hook.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
No, Carla, it means a lot more 
        to me than that.

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm telling you,        
 if this, if this kid is mine,

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,600
then... then I want             
to see that he's fed,

172
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,000
that he's clothed,          
    and that he's educated.

173
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
You know,                       
I'm-I'm gonna take

174
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,700
him to, to              
Little League games, too.

175
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm gonna be the    
            best damn father    
            you've ever seen.

176
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Please don't let
                him be mine!

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,900
Oh!

178
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh!

179
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,100
I tell you, if I get      
  out of this, I swear to God,

180
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,900
I am through fooling around   
            forever.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,900
Sam, don't swear to God.

182
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,000
No, I mean it, I mean it,       
     if I get out of this,

183
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,800
I swear to God,         
I'll never have sex again.

184
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,900
You?

185
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
Never?

186
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, not ever.

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
I mean, for the rest...

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,100
Well, three months,       
         three months.

189
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,800
Well, I guess the amount of sex 
    you have in three months

190
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,500
is what most people       
      have in a lifetime.       
Huh.

191
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,600
If they're attractive, I guess.

192
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,400
You have a phone call      
          from Denise.

193
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
( <i>sighs</i> )

194
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, and Carla,    
              you know that, uh,

195
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,900
pitcher of beer       
          you left on your tray?

196
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Some guy from table six
         came and drank it.

197
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,200
We don't have a table six.

198
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,700
I knew I should have said       
          table five.

199
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,900
Hello.

200
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, hi, Denise.

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Um, what'd the doctor say?

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,100
Oh, thank God,         
         oh, thank God!

203
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh, thank God! Oh!

204
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,500
Oh, I'm so happy.

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Well, I'm so happy          
    for the other guy.

206
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
Yeah.

207
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,300
Congratulations, huh?

208
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,800
All right, we-well,       
         I'll call you

209
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
some other time         
        then, all right?

210
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Bye-bye.

211
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,700
Doctor, Sam?

212
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
Uh, yeah, uh,

213
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,600
Denise and I and this, uh,      
        other guy

214
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,100
share the same doctor

215
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,700
and she just wanted
             to let me know

216
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,500
that he had gotten          
    some new magazines

217
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,000
in the waiting room.

218
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,700
You lucky dog!

219
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,000
Must be the       
              <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
             <i> "Swimsuit Issue."</i>

220

Say, uh... Suzanne,       
     uh... what do you say,

221
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,700
you want            
to help me celebrate here?

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,500
I'd love to.          
                          Great.

223
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,900
What are we celebrating?

224
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,200
I have no idea,   
              but whatever it is

225
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,800
we're overdressed.

226
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,100
( <i>Carla clears throat</i> ):
        Sam?

227
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah?                     
        Uh, Sam, aren't you     
        forgetting something?

228
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,600
I know, I know, I'm gonna       
  drop by the old drug store.

229
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't worry,                    
I learned my lesson.

230
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,400
Could you wait just...?

231
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,500
What?

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Does the name "God"
             ring a bell?

233
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah?

234
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,100
The guy you         
            made a vow to?

235
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh.

236
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,400
Yeah, boy, I almost             
forgot about that.

237
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,700
Uh... it's no big thing.

238
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,400
"No big thing"?

239
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
Come on, God's a sport.

240
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,800
People make promises            
like that all the time,

241
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
but if God had to collect       
on all of them,

242
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,500
He wouldn't have any time       
to create

243
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
natural wonders like that,      
         for instance.

244
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,300
I'll see you...                 
Oh, boy.

245
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,400
Give me a minute here.

246
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,500
CARLA:        
                  Listen, Sammy,

247
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I don't want to tell you        
how to run your life,

248
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,300
but I want to tell you this:    
don't mess with God.

249
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,900
Look at all the people          
in the Bible who did.

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,700
The entire population           
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

251
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,200
Lot's wife-- turned into        
a salt lick with boobs.

252
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,300
Come on, what...

253
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,100
What's He gonna do--            
reach down from the clouds

254
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,800
and snatch me up?

255
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,100
You know, you...

256
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Halt, infidel!

257
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, sorry, Sam.

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,100
Uh, I was just at               
an understudy rehearsal.

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,600
I thought you might get         
a kick out of my costume.

260
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
( <i>panting</i> ):            
        You ought to warn people

261
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,600
before you go around    
        pretending to be God.

262
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,800
You thought I was God?

263
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Thanks.             
 I was only trying to be Moses.

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
Hey, guys, he thought I was God!

265
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,900
Sam, can we go now?

266
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,800
Yeah, you bet.

267
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
No, no, Sam!

268
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
He has sent   
                  His messenger.

269
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Me...? What messenger?

270
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,100
That is just Woody.

271
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,800
You think it's a coincidence
    that Woody came in

272
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,200
just at that very moment
        dressed as Moses?

273
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,900
I mean, of all the plays he
     could have been in, Sammy.

274
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
He could have been     
         dressed as Auntie Mame.

275
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,600
Would that have
                 scared you?

276
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,300
Yeah, a little.

277
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's face it, Sam,
             that was a warning,

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,400
and you'd better
                take heed.

279
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,400
Oh, come on,                    
what's He gonna do?

280
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,300
Well, my cousin Tino...

281
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Yeah?

282
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,000
...swore he'd   
                give up meat.

283
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,200
That night,     
                he ate a burger.

284
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,600
The next day,      
             his teeth fell out.

285
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, come on, Carla.

286
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,300
There's no connection here.

287
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,900
I swore I would                 
not have sex, so...

288
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
( <i>shudders</i> )

Why not?

some other time.

        give me a call?

Yeah. I-I don't     
            have your number.

Oh, listen, Sam.

Uh, in the interest             
of authenticity,

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,300
you think there's anyway        
I can sound

300

less like God                   
and more like Moses?

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,800
That's good.

303
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,900
That's good,          
now, how 'bout the voice?

304
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,300
Now sit down.

305
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,800
Now...

306
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,700
how can I be of help?

307
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,800
Well, I would like          
      your advice, Father.

308
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Actually, it's for          
    a friend of mine.

309
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
He, uh...

310
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,000
got himself into kind of a bind,

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,900
and so, in desperation, promised
  God he'd give up something.

312
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,400
And what did he promise     
          to give up?

313
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
Sweets.

314
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,700
Oh.

315
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
I see.             
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )

316
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,700
Yeah...

317
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,100
but my friend          
really likes sweets a lot.

318
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,500
You know, and sweets      
        like him a lot.

319
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,600
And he hasn't had sweets now  
      for about two weeks,

320
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
and if he doesn't have sweets  
soon, he's gonna explode.

321
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
I see, and God's        
     contractual obligation

322
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,500
was to get your friend     
 out of this bind you spoke of.

323
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Yes, sir. Which He did.

324
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, then, what is the problem?

325
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Well, m-my friend was wondering 
what the penalty would be

326
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,500
if he, say... you know, had a...

327
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
huge box of chocolates.

328
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Sam, I think this is between you
         and your God.

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Yeah, right.

330
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh, how did...

331
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,900
How'd you know it was me?

332
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,900
In all the years people     
     have been coming here

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,700
for their friends, I have never 
met one of their friends.

334
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Oh, well, yeah,         
     as long as I'm busted,

335
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,500
I guess I might as well tell you

336
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,300
the truth here.

337
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,500
I-I didn't promise              
to give up sweets.

338
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,100
I promised to give up sex.

339
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
Ah...

340
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,400
that is a tough one.

341
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,900
You know, Sam, the Church

342
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,600
does recommend chastity     
      to unmarried people.

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,800
( <i>chuckles</i> )

344
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,300
Oh, I'm sorry.         
    You were serious. Uh...

345
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
How do you do that?

346
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,200
I mean, what do <i>you</i> do?

347
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
How do you not?

348
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,300
I mean, a-are there             
special tricks, or a

349
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,900
certain way           
    of sitting, maybe?

350
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Well, yes, but we are strictly 
    forbidden to reveal it.

351
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,000
You're kidding.

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
Yes.

353
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,200
Oh.

354
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,500
You know, Sam, I think     
you're looking for someone

355
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,200
to tell you it's all right      
    to break your vow,

356
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,400
but I can't
                     do that.

357
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
You know, I've found that people
         who come here

358
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
looking for answers usually   
    know what the answer is,

359
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
and I think you do, too.

360
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,800
Yeah, maybe.

361
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
Well, thank you.

362
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Oh...

363
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh, no, no, no.

364
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
SAM:            
                Carla, Carla?

365
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,300
Oh, great.             
         Look. I think I got it.

366
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,000
God's gonna have   
             to accept this one.

367
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
"With the Lord, one day
         is as a thousand years,

368
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,300
and a thousand years
            is as one day."

369
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,600
So?

370
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
So that means

371
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,500
I've been out of action
         for 21,000 years.

372
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Come on, that's got to 
         be good enough for Him.

373
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,600
You know, Sam, I-I'd            
like to agree with you--

374
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,900
( <i>sighs</i> )   
since you're so                 
pathetic it's annoying--

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
but no sale.

376
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
All right, all right,      
 I still got Deuteronomy here.

377
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't look, Sammy.

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,900
Temptation at 12:00.

379
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,900
Oh...

380
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,200
Oh... Oh, God.

381
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,000
Man, they're coming in waves.

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,400
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

383
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Cheers.

384
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah, this is him.

385
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,200
You're kidding.

386
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,400
Moses has an ear infection.

387
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

388
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,300
I'll be right there.

389
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,100
So, Woody, they gonna           
let you go on?

390
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,900
Uh, no, I got to stop      
        by the drugstore

391
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
and pick up some antibiotics.

392
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,200
So, believe it or not,     
  I've given up sex entirely.

393
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,500
But you got to promise          
not to tell anybody.

394
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Well, Sam,     
                 confidentiality

395
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,100
is the bedrock      
            of my profession.

396
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,800
Besides, who'd
                  believe me?

397
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
You were saying?

398
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,100
Well, I was just wondering      
what you think I ought to do.

399
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,500
Well, you need to find

400
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
another outlet for      
        your sexual energies.

401
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,500
Mm-hmm.                 
              For example,

402
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,000
during six painfully frustrating
months of my adolescence,

403
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,500
I built a submarine             
in our basement.

404
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,700
One of those          
          little plastic models?

405
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,500
No, life-size. Slept six.

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,700
The happiest hours              
of my youth were spent

407
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,000
down there in the dark          
shouting, "Fire one.

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,500
Fire two."

409
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Well, enough about me.

410
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,700
Let's address                   
this problem, Sam.

411
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Well, I don't know        
      anything about submarines.

412
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,200
Well, surely you                
have other interests.

413
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,400
Sports, sailing, music?

414
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,900
Well, yeah, I had a
             piano lesson once.

415
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Actually, I had     
            the piano <i>teacher</i>

416
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
and it was twice, but...

417
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,400
I liked it.

418
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Well, I'll tell you.

419
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,600
If you were to sit down         
at the piano today

420
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,800
and channel your energies       
into it,

421
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,600
you would find                  
all your sexual tensions

422
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,200
pouring out                     
through your fingertips.

423
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Yeah, fingertips.

424
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,100
Yeah, right.

425
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,300
And best of all, Sam,

426
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,900
no matter how badly you perform,
     a piano never laughs.

427
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,900
Never stomps out of the room

428
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,100
and refuses to let you     
play again for three days.

429
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, I'm off to Lilith.

430
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,200
( <i>yawning</i> ):       
                 Sam?

431
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,500
Would you please
                lock up?

432
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,100
Uh, yeah.               
I'm going home to bed.

433
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,200
Okay, good night.

434
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Did you hear me?

435
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,000
I said I'm going                
to go to bed.

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
Well, I hope you, uh,

437
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
get a good night's sleep.

438
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,600
Thank you.

439
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,900
Carla, I just left myself       
        wide open

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,400
for one of Sam's sleazy remarks,
          and nothing.

441
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
I mean, not that I want to,     
but what does it mean

442
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,200
when you can't turn on the      
horniest guy that ever lived?

443
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,300
I am really getting old.

444
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, Rebecca, would you
          stop being ridiculous?

445
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,800
You're still a young,      
    beautiful, vibrant woman

446
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
with her whole life       
         ahead of her.

447
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,100
Oh, you're just saying that.

448
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
Yes, I am.

449
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
I was taught to humor old folks.

450
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,900
Carla, I ca...

451
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,800
I can't take this anymore.

452
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,500
I mean, I tried everything.

453
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,200
I've stopped eating oysters,

454
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm taking cold showers,

455
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,600
I even started stuffing ice   
         in my pockets.

456
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,500
I tell you, I'm not going       
          to make it.

457
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh, Sammy, buck up.

458
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,500
You only have          
     nine more weeks to go.

459
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm talking about tonight.

460
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,400
Guess who?

461
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,900
Uh-oh.          
I'll give you a hint.

462
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,500
Vermont ski lodge,              
a roaring fire,

463
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,200
and baby oil.

464
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,400
Uh... could you, uh,

465
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
be more specific?

466
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,500
Gravity boots.

467
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,100
Oh, Rachel Patterson.

468
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
( <i>laughs</i> )                    
            Oh, look...

469
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,300
Hi, Sam, how are you?

470
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh, boy.

471
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,200
I tell you, honey,    
          you're the last person

472
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,300
in the world I want
             to see right now.

473
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,600
Nice to see you, too.

474
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Uh...

475
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,400
Listen, I have got              
an 18-hour layover,

476
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,200
and I'm not                     
the least bit sleepy.

477
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,700
How'd you like to help me       
kill some time?

478
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,200
Listen, what, um...

479
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,900
Actually, I hear, uh,   
        movies are good for     
        that kind of thing.

480
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,800
Why don't you, uh, why 
         don't you take in about

481
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,000
two or three          
     right in a row, there?

482
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,800
I know-- smell.

483
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
I'm wearing that perfume    
that always drove you so crazy.

484
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,100
Oh, Devastation, huh?

485
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,700
Uh...

486
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,100
Actually, I got this, uh,       
        this head cold.

487
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,400
Uh, I wouldn't want
             you to catch it.

488
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
Um, I'm sorry, uh...

489
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,000
what do you say,        
     some other time, huh?

490
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,900
Well, okay.

491
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh, Sam?

492
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
Yeah?

493
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,700
A friend of mine                
snapped this

494
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
of me on a beach in Ipanema.

495
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,300
I thought               
     you might like a copy.

496
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Oh.

497
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,200
Would you excuse me

498
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,700
just for a  
                    minute here?

499
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,000
Look at this!

500
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,800
I mean, this is not fair.

501
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,000
I mean, I'm going for it.

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
It's-it's not          
  like I'm murdering anybody.

503
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,800
I-I'm just going to bring   
    a great deal of pleasure

504
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
to two people.

505
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
So, if in Your,         
      uh, infinite wisdom,

506
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,300
You feel You have           
    to smite me down,

507
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
then please           
  make it quick and painless.

508
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
And if You could give me    
    about three hours,

509
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,400
I'd appreciate it.

510
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,700
Okay.

511
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,700
Sam?

512
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,800
( <i>sniffing</i> )

513
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,400
Devastation.

514
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,500
The hound is loose.

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Please, go easy on him.

516
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,900
Sammy, now you've done it.

517
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,200
There's nothing   
              in your future but
              frogs and locusts.

518
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,100
Why'd you have to   
            go and do it, Sammy?

519
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
I didn't do it.

520
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
What?

521
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,900
I didn't do it.

522
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,200
We went to the hotel,

523
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
she got into bed,

524
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,600
I got into bed with her.

525
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,100
Then I was folding up my socks, 
          and I was...

526
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
You fold up                     
your socks?

527
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,000
Sure. I'm not an animal.

528
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,800
Anyway, all of a sudden,    
         for no reason,

529
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
I went over and I,

530
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,400
and I opened          
     the nightstand drawer.

531
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,100
And there it was,           
    staring right up at me.

532
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
The Bible.

533
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,900
Can you imagine that--     
    a Bible in a hotel room?

534
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
So, we... we got out of there  
          real quick,

535
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,900
and we got another room, and...

536
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,600
there it was again.

537
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,300
I mean, we... we went      
     from hotel to hotel,

538
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,200
and it just followed us     
    wherever we went.

539
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Then it dawned on me.

540
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
This was a bona fide miracle.

541
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
God was speaking

542
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,800
to me directly         
through hotel nightstands.

543
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,700
He works in mysterious ways.

544
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,500
Amen. Amen.

545
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,900
Excuse me,  
                    Sam, but, uh

546
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,100
in all the years        
      you played baseball,

547
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
traveling               
    throughout the country,

548
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,200
all the hotel rooms       
         you stayed in,

549
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,500
didn't you ever once notice...?

550
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,100
Uh, Frasier,                    
Sam was just telling us

551
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,400
about a miracle

552
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,000
that affected him               
very deeply.

553
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,300
Now, what was it        
    that you were noticing?

554
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
Well, th-they always put    
  those little strips of paper

555
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,700
across the toilets.

556
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,700
Just an observation.

557
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,100
Sammy, I'm so proud of you.

558
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,800
( <i>chuckling</i> ):      
                Yeah.

559
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,300
If you could hold out      
          last night,

560
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
you can make it         
    the whole three months.

561
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Sam, I'm late for a party.

562
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Can you help me     
            with this zipper?

563
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,400
Sam? Sam?                       
Sam? Sam?

564
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Sam...!

565
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Piano. Piano, Sam.

566
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,400
For God's sake, piano!
