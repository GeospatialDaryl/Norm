     <i>a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:07,172
Friends, congratulate me.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,208
I've just had my first     
     3 consecutive hours        
     of sleep

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,344
since i became a father.

5
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:14,712
Lilith's been makin' you       
 get up with the baby           
 at night when it cries, huh?

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,864
Well,                          
 being a progressive couple,    
 we actually take turns,

7
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,801
but last night                 
 as she was gently nudging me

8
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,753
with one of                
     her serrated elbows,

9
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,123
i fell back                
     on the old yoga trick

10
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:27,792
of lowering my heart rate,

11
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:30,495
holding my breath,

12
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,314
and staring blankly         
    as though i was dead.

13
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:34,615
And that worked?

14
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:36,634
Nope. Didn't buy it        
     for a minute.

15
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,271
See, i forgot it was she       
 that taught me that trick      
 during our honeymoon.

16
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,409
You know, this, uh, gettin' up 
 in the middle of the night

17
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,511
with the cryin' baby stuff,    
 that's...

18
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:49,580
that's the reason              
 i never had kids.

19
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:52,734
That's the only reason, 
        huh, cliff?

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,804
Yeah, well, that and the fact  
 that my mother taught me

21
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,272
to have a healthy respect

22
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:58,506
for the evils                  
 of overpopulation,

23
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:00,242
know what i mean?              
                    Hmm.

24
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:02,778
Yeah, you know, i--i can still 
 remember her lookin' at me     
 and sayin',

25
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:06,114
"for the love of god, cliffie, 
 let it stop with you."

00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:23,157
ok, people,                    
 i've got a special day         
 planned with robin,

42
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,226
so i'm leaving the bar         
 in your control.

43
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,128
(Rebecca)                      
 i want everything shipshape.

44
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:29,197
Carla,                     
     straighten up your apron.

45
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:30,798
Woody, fix your hair.

46
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,334
Sam, stop fixing your hair.

47
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,054
Robin'll be by shortly,        
 and he's taking the day off.

48
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,123
Oh, how nice for you.  
    Oh, good.

49
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,875
Nice?

50
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:43,110
I don't think you understand   
 the significance of this.

51
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,697
Men like robin colcord  
        do not take days off.

52
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,615
He had to shift appointments,  
 put off deals,

53
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:48,934
cancel plane flights.

54
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,585
When a man like robin      
     takes a day off,

55
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,388
it is a major commitment.

56
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:55,573
While for me,       
            it's a way of life.

57
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,826
So, i guess                    
 this is some kind of honor,

58
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:01,529
him hangin' out with you       
 instead of his other babe.

59
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,698
You know the chick             
 from the french consulate.

60
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,000
That chick is in paris     
     being debriefed.

61
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:10,137
Oh, i thought robin            
 was in charge of that.

62
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,923
You know, i am really      
     not jealous of her.

63
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,491
I don't care, i am winning.

64
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,493
It is obvious he prefers me.

65
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:16,877
And he's never taken           
 a whole day off

66
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,913
[in french accent]             
 with jeanne marie.

67
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,532
Well, maybe she has

68
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,999
[in french accent]             
 a real job.

69
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,518
So, what do you 
                plan on doing?

70
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,504
Oh, nothing special.           
 We're just gonna

71
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,640
play it by ear,         
        go with the flow.

72
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,191
Hey, miss howe,

73
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:34,112
i finished ironing          
    your wardrobe for the day.

74
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,247
Why didn't you tell me         
 the iron has a spray setting?

75
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:39,084
I got all dried out            
 spittin' on your clothes.

76
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,586
Thank you, woody.

77
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,404
So, what's all this?

78
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,690
Today, robin and i             
 are gonna live out             
 every fantasy i've ever had,

79
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,758
and i want to be   
             properly attired.

80
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,411
So, this is for the beach, 
     walking hand in hand,

81
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:53,347
picnic in the park, 
            paddle boats,

82
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,599
zoo,

83
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,268
seventh row,           
          <i>phantom of the opera,</i>

84
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:58,803
and this...

85
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,624
is for the end         
         of a romantic evening.

86
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:06,311
You plannin' on locking        
 your keys in your car,         
 miss howe?

87
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,698
Yes, woody.

88
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,684
Well, you've gone              
 to a lot of trouble.

89
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,518
How long have you been         
 plannin' this?

90
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:17,121
Since my first day             
 of puberty.

91
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:20,058
Ah, pubescence,

92
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,726
(cliff)            
             an emotional time.

93
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,845
I don't mind saying it,     
    puberty was one long        
    nightmare for me.

94
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,514
How's that, cliff?

95
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:30,784
Ma wouldn't allow it        
    in the house.

96
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:33,371
Well,                          
 on the lovely array of images  
 that brings to mind,

97
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,507
i'm going to adjourn           
 to the back room.

98
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:38,409
I'm ready for a game of darts  
 if anybody's man enough.

99
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,445
Sorry, i'm busy.

100
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,131
[Clearing throat]              
 uh, i will,                    
 i'll play you for a beer.

101
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,049
Oh, want to make       
         a little wager, huh?

102
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,718
No, no, if you, uh,            
 buy me a beer, i'll play you.

103
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:51,506
Sam? Set up my friend norm, 
    here.

104
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,558
Hello, rebecca.

105
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,326
Hi, sweet baby.

106
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,113
Mmm!

107
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,398
Are you ready for the most 
     relaxing, exciting day     
     of your life?

108
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,717
I most certainly am.        
    I just have to make         
    one phone call first.

109
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,320
Wait? It isn't     
             business, is it?

110
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,255
On my day off?

111
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,823
[Scoffing]                     
 certainly not.

112
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,327
Ah, yes. This is, uh, colcord.

113
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:15,296
Give me 5,000 shares           
 of metronix international.

114
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:16,747
Robin?

115
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,099
Oh, yes. Well, i'll call you   
 later, aunt beryl.

116
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,535
God bless.

117
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,671
So, uh, what would you         
 like to do today?

118
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:26,424
Ok, i'd like to go             
 to the beach, then i'd like    
 to go paddle-boating,

119
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,126
to the zoo--        
     oh, yes. Your, um,

120
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:31,262
first day of puberty dream.    
 It had slipped my mind.

121
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:33,347
Well, let's be off, eh?        
         Ok, i'll get ready.

122
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,949
Oh, i have to get into     
     my beachcombing outfit.

123
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,701
Oh, and here's yours.

124
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,852
Right here.

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,270
And--and here,

126
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,839
is a little terry-cloth cap 
    for you to wear.

127
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,023
No.

128
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,159
Fine.

129
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:49,163
Hey, mr. Colcord,  
             i think it's great

130
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,598
that you're takin' 
             a day off.

131
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,552
You know, back in hanover, 
     we used to always          
     take sundays off.

132
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:57,271
Yeah,                      
     me and the family used to  
     dress in our best clothes

133
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,608
and sit in the parlor,         
 and read from the good book.

134
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,977
Then afterward,         
        me and my brother would 
        go out to the barn

135
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,095
and read from a bad book.

136
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:08,950
I loved sundays.

137
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,586
Well,                  
         i whupped 'em both.

138
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:14,722
Oh, yeah, frasier.             
 You definitely threw the one

139
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,158
that came closest  
             to the dartboard.

140
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,561
Now,                        
    what is that unusual taste?

141
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,729
Ah, yes! Sour grapes.

142
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:23,898
So, does anybody else wish to

143
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,768
snatch the laurels of victory  
 from my brow?

144
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:30,554
Well, something's gotta 
        cover that beach        
        you call a forehead.

145
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,509
Mr. Colcord.

146
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:37,328
You english guys,          
     you--you play darts a lot, 
     don't you?

147
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,814
Oh, yes, we english do nothing 
 but sit around in pubs,

148
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:43,184
sipping thick, warm ale,    
    throwing darts incessantly,

149
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,620
dropping our h's,          
     and singing                
      <i>god save the queen,</i>

150
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:48,456
that's all we do in england.

151
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,458
Well, that film strip      
     they showed in junior high

152
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,493
was right on the money.

153
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,564
No, i'm sorry i snapped.

154
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,967
It's, um,                      
 not because of you people.

155
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:01,869
It's this business of, um,     
 sitting around all day,

156
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:03,738
doing nothing.

157
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,974
Gets on my nerves, you know.

158
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,241
Or, um,

159
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:10,028
maybe it is you people.

160
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,697
So, darts.                 
     Who shall i thrash first?

161
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,048
Well,                          
 i'll play you for a beer.

162
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, a little wager.

163
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,151
Mmm, not exactly.

164
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,136
[Inaudible]

165
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,808
that guy is        
             so damn arrogant.

166
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,377
Yup. He likes his beer, too.

167
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,248
No,                        
     i was talkin' about robin.

168
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,816
Yeah, but you must admit,

169
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:35,586
mr. Peterson                   
 can cop an attitude.

170
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:39,440
You know, i--i--i hope         
 normie just knocks him down    
 a peg or 2.

171
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:43,161
Yeah, well, we all know    
     that norm isn't the best   
     darts player in the bar.

172
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,546
And we all know who is,    
     don't we, sammy?

173
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:47,515
Come on!       
     No, no,                    
     i don't want to play him.

174
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,550
I mean, it's one thing 
         when you play friends,

175
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,019
that's kind of fun,    
         you know?

176
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,953
But when you start playin'  
    people you don't like,

177
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,755
other things kinda enter in.

178
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:57,224
You start thinkin' about   
     those times

179
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,261
that he screwed you out        
 of all that money,

180
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,997
or how he, uh,             
     beat you to rebecca

181
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,299
after you worked on her    
     for all those years,

182
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,735
and how he always makes you 
    kinda feel

183
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,304
like a stupid,          
        know-nothing jerk

184
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:13,340
with lousy clothes         
     and a stupid job.

185
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:16,678
You know somethin',    
         i'm gonna kick         
         that guy's royal butt!

186
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,052
[All cheering]          
         (man)                  
         hey! Way to go, robin!

187
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,154
You know, it just isn't fair.

188
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,557
I came in to-- i wanted to be  
 one of the guys.

189
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,493
All i'm doin' is               
 sittin' on my duff, watchin'   
 other people do things.

190
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,962
Welcome to normworld.

191
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,965
Keep your hands inside the car 
 at all times.

192
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:42,169
Hi, darling.               
     Ready to go to the beach?

193
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,088
I've been to the beach,        
 thank you.

194
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,940
Well,                          
 why didn't you ask me to go?

195
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,859
I did, i came in here          
 and screamed your name out     
 at least a half a dozen times.

196
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,761
I thought                  
     you were cheering me on.

197
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,696
You mean you had to go         
 to the beach all by yourself?

198
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,265
No, i went with woody.

199
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:57,168
I did all those stupid things  
 that i dreamed of doing.

200
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:58,769
We walked on the shore,

201
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:02,240
and we fed the seagulls,    
    and we skipped stones.

202
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,276
I buried woody up to his neck  
 in the sand, and...

203
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,863
oh, my god. Woody!

204
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,332
All right, last shot!      
     Sammy needs a bull's-eye   
     to win.

205
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,268
All right. You mean        
     one of these here?

206
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,205
[All cheering]

207
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,691
sammy wins!

208
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,109
Are you sure about the score?

209
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:24,812
Absolutely.                
     I kept score with peanuts.

210
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,432
This is you. This is sam.  
     Norm?

211
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:30,184
That's right. Uh, 250 to 249.

212
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,621
You know, if you hurry,        
 i think you can catch up       
 with rebecca there.

213
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,257
Do you fancy           
         another game, sam?

214
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:38,209
Oh, no, come on. It's over.

215
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,427
Let's just                 
     walk away from this,

216
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:41,796
a winner and a loser.

217
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,598
Say, boys,                     
 who was the winner again?

218
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,984
(All)                      
     sammy! Sammy! Sammy!

219
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,720
Well, if not darts, 
            what about a--

220
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,621
a friendly game of pool, eh?

221
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,809
No, no, i never like           
 to nail a guy twice            
 in one afternoon.

222
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,760
You haven't lived.

223
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,497
Well,                       
    perhaps i could make the...

224
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,682
i could make the prospect  
     a little more enticing

225
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,150
if we threw in a wager, huh?

226
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:06,187
Shall we say... um, here,  
     uh, one u.S. Dollar?

227
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,622
[All murmuring]            
                         (norm) 
                         whoa!

228
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:08,889
Big spender, eh?

229
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:10,357
One lousy buck?

230
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,192
Well, you see, sam,

231
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,462
a real sportsman       
         wouldn't consider it   
         a lousy buck,

232
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,330
but a trophy.

233
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,866
Something to be held   
         over the head          
         of the vanquished.

234
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,401
A symbol of victory.

235
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,271
All right. Lag for break.

236
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,508
Although i can't understand    
 why anyone would get           
 that excited about

237
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,894
winning a dollar.

238
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,729
 Nah, nah, nah, nah

239
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,864
(all)                      
      nah, nah, nah, nah

240
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,100
 hey, hey, hey

241
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,085
 goodbye

242
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,121
 nah, nah, nah, nah

243
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,073
 nah, nah, nah, nah

244
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,057
 hey, hey, hey

245
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,626
[whooping]             
          goodbye

246
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:47,962
oh, don't feel bad, robin.

247
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,531
You'd have beat him 
            if you'd called     
            that last shot.

248
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:53,451
You mean the one               
 that ricocheted off            
 that mailman's head?

249
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,036
Yep. Now, if you'd said:

250
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,473
"8-ball off of cliffie's       
 temple,"

251
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,676
then maybe this portrait       
 of george washington           
 might be yours.

252
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:04,378
Uh, by the way, boys,          
 which president was he again?

253
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,498
Number one!            
         Number one!            
         Number one!

254
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,435
Hey, cliffie!

255
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,936
Hey,                   
         how you feel, cliff?

256
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,022
Oh, fine, fine. Just a little  
 crack in the head.             
                 All right.

257
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,675
So, uh...              
         oh, who won the game?

258
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:18,976
Sammy.

259
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,062
Ah, did you? That's great.     
 That's great.

260
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,347
Carla, how about a beer here,  
 huh? Thanks.

261
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,150
So, uh, who won the game?

262
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,154
Sammy did.                 
                 Yeah.

263
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,107
No kiddin'?                    
 Gee, that's great, sam.

264
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,259
How about a beer there,        
 carla, huh?

265
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,479
Uh, cliff,

266
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,681
what do you say         
        we trot on down

267
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:43,817
to the old emergency    
        room just for fun, huh?

268
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:46,787
Yeah, yeah.        
             Sure thing, frase.

269
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,555
So, who won that game?

270
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,843
So, do you fancy               
 another game, sam?

271
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:55,563
Whoo, boy, robin,          
     you are a glutton.

272
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,565
Well, it's not often           
 i meet someone who can         
 offer me such a challenge.

273
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,067
I must confess,

274
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,369
i rarely lose.

275
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,487
Really?                        
 Well, you're a natural at it.

276
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,656
[Guffawing]                    
 hey!

277
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,974
Yes, you're very kind.

278
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,043
It's not surprising            
 you beat me                    
 at these physical games.

279
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:10,244
I mean,                        
 all they depended upon

280
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,880
were simple hand-to-eye        
 coordination,

281
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,348
animal cunning.

282
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,617
I mean,                        
 these are the only things      
 you're adroit at.

283
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:17,701
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

284
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,070
No one calls me a droit.

285
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,172
(All)              
             sammy!

286
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,340
Sammy!

287
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,674
Sammy!

288
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,243
No, but, how do you think  
     you would fare

289
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,611
in a game whose outcome

290
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,312
rested purely on intelligence,

291
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,680
acumen,

292
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,698
cognitive reasoning?

293
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:33,500
Ok.

294
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:36,536
Carla, break out the yahtzee.

295
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,806
No. I--i was referring

296
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:41,275
to the age-old game of chess.

297
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,793
Or don't you indulge           
 in such sport

298
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,895
in this cultural wasteland?

299
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,214
[All protesting]           
     hey, hey!

300
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,449
Wait a minute.

301
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,618
Are you talkin' about  
         my country?

302
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,536
No, i'm talkin' about          
 this bar.

303
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,988
Oh? Well, you don't know   
     the half of it.

304
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,374
Yeah, all right. Ok.

305
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,842
I'll-- i'll play you           
 a little game of chess.

306
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,295
But let's not, uh,             
 go for this weenie dollar bet, 
 here.

307
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,863
I'll tell you what.

308
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,531
Double or nothin'.

309
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,700
Well, what d'you say--     
     what do you say we make it

310
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,052
something worth our while?

311
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,804
Both of us, eh?                
 Um, a week's pay.

312
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,440
My salary

313
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:15,375
against your salary.

314
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:16,677
Uh, that's not exactly fair,   
 now.

315
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,345
You--you don't make tips.

316
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:19,830
[All laughing]

317
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,485
and what do you say, sam?

318
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:25,903
All right. Sure.

319
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,221
Fine.

320
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,774
Right. I'm going back      
     to my penthouse,

321
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,610
and i'll get my chess set.

322
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,279
And i'll see you       
         in an hour, sam.

323
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,647
I'll be here.

324
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,133
Boy, sammy, i am impressed.

325
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,769
I mean, you have put a lot     
 on the line.

326
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:44,304
You have any idea              
 how much that guy takes home   
 in a week?

327
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,974
I tell ya, that's enough money 
 for me to buy back this bar.

328
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,575
Yes!        
     We are home free.

329
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:49,943
All right, sammy.

330
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,130
All i gotta do is learn how    
 to play chess in an hour.

331
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,603
Uh, you know, what the heck.   
 It's gotta be easier           
 than yahtzee.

332
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,396
Oh, here's where               
 everybody is.

333
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:10,547
Frasier, how's cliff?

334
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,982
Oh, he's fine, fine.

335
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,884
He'll be all right,            
 i think.

336
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,686
They wanna keep him under      
 observation for a while

337
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,205
until he's completely normal.

338
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,908
Gee, i never got        
        to say goodbye.

339
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,477
So, uh, what is                
 all this, anyway?

340
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:24,678
Oh, you're gonna love this.

341
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:26,347
[Chuckling]                 
     see, sammy and robin

342
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:29,016
are playin' chess              
 for one week's wages, right?

343
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,601
We got this            
         computer chess game

344
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,670
so that sammy can beat robin.

345
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,340
And norm is gonna feed him     
 all the right moves            
 over this headset.

346
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,794
Well, i hate to spoil your fun 
 with a moral voice,

347
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:43,698
but, uh, isn't that            
 what we used to call cheating?

348
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,733
I mean, isn't that just like   
 stealing robin's money?

349
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:49,252
No, frasier, i'm not       
     doin' this for the money.

350
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,455
I just wanna           
         get the satisfaction

351
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,757
of seein' his expression    
    when he gives me the check.

352
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:55,142
And once it's in my hand,  
             oh.

353
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,695
I will rip it up           
     and throw it in his face.

354
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:01,065
Maybe.

355
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,600
So, where did you get          
 all this expensive listening   
 equipment, anyway?

356
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,886
Oh, this is pete's stuff.  
     He uses this stuff         
     all the time.

357
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,656
Pete, are--are you         
     a surveillance expert?

358
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:11,142
No. My wife sleeps around  
     a lot.

359
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,783
All right!             
         Bird for 3!

360
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,986
Sam, are you going to          
 play chess or listen           
 to your basketball game?

361
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,722
I can do both.

362
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,073
King's rook

363
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,524
to queen one.

364
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:28,742
Ok.

365
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,811
King's rook to queen one.

366
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:34,748
Well, in that case, uh,

367
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:38,519
my horsey guy takes            
 your little pointy-headed guy.

368
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,908
You know,

369
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,010
you're a--                     
 you're a fascinating opponent,

370
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,712
obviously unskilled            
 in the finer points            
 of the game.

371
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,681
You have                       
 an instinctive raw talent      
 that pulls you through

372
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:54,151
and makes me want              
 to squash you like a bug.

373
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,387
Queen takes bishop. Check.

374
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:58,255
All right! Jump ball!

375
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:01,058
Oh, god! I wish you could  
     hear this game, you guys.  
 Sam? Sam. Here.

376
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,393
Sam? I checked. I checked.     
                 Yeah? Oh.

377
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,412
Sorry. Check.      
             All right, uh...

378
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:08,582
well, in that case, um,

379
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,718
my castle takes your queen.

380
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:13,770
Get out of that,   
             rich boy.

381
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,977
(Rebecca)                      
 well.

382
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,779
Robin.

383
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,715
Woody and i                
     have been to the beach,

384
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,417
we have been to the zoo,

385
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,586
we went paddle-boating,

386
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,887
we saw  <i>phantom.</i>

387
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:33,491
Oh, it was wonderful.      
     Thank you for asking.

388
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:35,426
Woody was a model escort,

389
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,894
except for one little annoying 
 habit of constantly asking me,

390
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,664
"is this part scary?   
         Is this part scary?"

391
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,535
It was.                        
 Thank you for asking.

392
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,970
I am going to go freshen up,

393
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,706
and then we are going  
         to a late supper.

394
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,243
Oh, uh, actually, miss howe,   
 i'm not really hungry.

395
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,711
I was talking to robin.

396
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,379
Oh, yeah.

397
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,848
Dream on.

398
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,237
Norm, how many times           
 have i told you

399
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,573
i don't want you in here       
 trying to erase your bar tab?

400
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,292
Oh, come on.

401
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,112
Come on, you think         
     i would do something       
     as deceitful as that?

402
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,347
I'm only trying to help sammy  
 cheat at chess.

403
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,865
That's terrible.

404
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:15,999
Can you step on it?

405
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,435
Robin and i                    
 can still make that supper.

406
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,103
I'm tryin', i'm tryin',

407
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,539
but, i tell ya,        
         my bar tab's eatin' up

408
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:24,941

         on this computer.

What?

419
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,201
I said, "pardon me."

420
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,436
I burped.

00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,989
No, you didn't.

 one day, and i won't hear it.

Oh, poor sammy.

430
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,792
Oh, come on, guys,         
     we've seen sammy

431
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,595
in situations like this     
    hundreds of times.

432
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,831
You know,                      
 the--the game's on the line,

433
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,432
the best hitter's comin' up    
 to the plate,

434
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,800
men on second and third.

435
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,268
And who do they call in?

436
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,804
"Mayday" malone                
 with his slider of death.

437
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,490
And what would he do?

438
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:32,776
Well, he'd usually give up 
     a 3-run homer.

439
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:36,012
It was sam's teammates     
     who called it              
     "the slider of death."

440
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,383
So, they had a man on first

441
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,151
and a man on second.

442
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,854
Who do they call in        
     but old "mayday" malone

443
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,241
with his slider of death.

444
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,560
Why did they call it that?

445
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,130
None of your business.

446
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,599
That's very nice,              
 but your time                  
 is running out, sam.

447
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,766
Move or forfeit.

448
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:57,985
Ah...

449
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,171
all right, fine, there.

450
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:06,226
That's either the stupidest    
 move in the world, or...

451
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,013
that 's very clever, sam.

452
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,082
What will you do           
     when i move my bishop

453
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,318
to king knight 5?

454
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,120
I don't know.

455
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,940
Oh, is this, uh,   
             horsey guy mine?

456
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:22,609
Yes.

457
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,611
Well, ahem,

458
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,630
gonna move that here,

459
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:30,033
and that's...checkmate.

460
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:34,704
What?

461
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:40,277
Well, yeah.        
             Yeah, i win.       
             That's checkmate.

462
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,578
[Laughing]     
                 yeah.

463
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,647
Yeah. You shouldn't have moved 
 your cardinal, bub.

464
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:46,032
Bishop! It's called a bishop!

465
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,135
And i only moved him           
 because your last move         
 was so incredibly stupid,

466
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:51,204
that i thought you were     
    up to something clever.

467
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:55,792
Yeah. Well,                 
    sometimes incredibly stupid 
    is clever enough for me.

468
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,694
Why did you do that?           
 Up to then, you were playing

469
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:59,262
a classic alekhine's defense,

470
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,932
and i was matching you         
 every step of the way.

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,552
Why in the world               
 did you make that stupid move?

472
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,787
Wait, wait.

473
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,205
Which one of you told him

474
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,274
to make that stupid move?

475
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:16,546
You knew?                      
        What do you think i am, 
        an idiot?

476
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,066
What gave me away?

477
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,668
Well, for starters,

478
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:24,221
the basketball game            
 which you were supposed to be  
 listening to

479
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:25,538
was on the television set  
     behind you,

480
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:28,408
and it had been over   
         for about an hour.

481
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,527
Boy, those english guys 
        are clever.

482
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,498
No wonder we lost that war.

483
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,066
No.

484
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,801
We didn't lose the war. 
        We won it.

485
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,838
Oh, right. Then how come       
 we speak english?

486
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,263
Hey, man, come on,  
            you know,

487
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:52,583
just don't be a droit.

488
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,688
All right, all right. If you   
 knew this game was fixed,

489
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,274
then how come           
        you went along with it?

490
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,659
Are you joking?

491
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:05,062
That was the only thing        
 about the game that held any   
 challenge for me, samuel.

492
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,848
Ok, so you knew it was fixed   
 and yet you went ahead         
 and played.

493
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,783
I say that i won,      
         fair and square.

494
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,968
You owe me.            
         One week's salary.     
         Come on, bud.

495
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,421
And don't, uh, leave out    
    any of those little zeros,  
    there.

496
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,022
Oh, right you are, sam.

497
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,792
Um, i must preface this 
        by saying that, um,

498
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,562
in order to keep        
        my tax bracket low,     
        i am a corporation.

499
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:24,164
And the nominal salary     
     i pay myself

500
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:26,399
as president            
        of that corporation

501
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,335
is $1 a year,

502
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:31,538
which means that, uh,      
     my weekly salary           
     after taxes is...

503
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,491
one penny.

504
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,844
(Rebecca)              
         well, well.

505
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,517
One penny.

506
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,404
Sam,

507
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,989
you used all this electronic   
 paraphernalia to cheat,

508
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:51,958
and what did it get you?

509
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:54,328
One penny.

510
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:59,232
And you, robin.

511
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,102
You take the one day off       
 that you've had in years,

512
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,704
and what do you do with it?

513
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:06,472
You spend the whole day        
 fighting over...

514
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:09,242
one penny.

515
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:12,496
And what about me?

516
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,465
You take the one day

517
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,034
that i have always             
 dreamed about,

518
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,754
and you turn it                
 into the most depressing,

519
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,890
pathetic day of my life.

520
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:32,215
Oh, woody, i'm sorry.      
     I had fun with you!

521
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,883
Look what you did!

522
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,621
You know,              
         you're right, rebecca.

523
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,240
I've been acting like a fool.

524
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:42,943
You see, for one moment,   
     i actually lost control

525
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,545
of that competitive edge

526
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,212
which built my empire.

527
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,214
Yeah. I apologize.

528
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,285
And what did you learn, sam?

529
00:22:52,353 --> 00:22:55,221
Well, i learned that it's not  
 that much fun to play games

530
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,191
if all you're worried about    
 is winning or losing.

531
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,795
I'm sorry that we ruined       
 your day like that.

532
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,548
I guess i said a lot of        
 childish things, there, robin.

533
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:05,933
I'm sorry, um,

534
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,684
you're a good sport.

535
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,070
[Clears throat]                
 let's just call it even,       
 shall we?

536
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:15,826
1, 2, 3, 4,            
         i declare a thumb war.

537
