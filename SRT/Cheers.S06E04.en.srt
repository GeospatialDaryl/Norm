     Hey, Sam, me and Eddie     
      are getting married!      

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,500
 She's, uh, quite a catch, Ed.  

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,100
Seems that Eddie and I picked   
the one day of the century      

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,100
when all the planets            
and constellations              

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,400
are in perfect alignment.       

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,300
    So we either get married    
      by 4:00 p.m. today,       

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,000
or we wait until the year 2042. 

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,700
      This is going to be       
    an interesting wedding,

      people in the world.      

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,700
Hey, hey, don't say that.       
It's bad luck.                  

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,900
            Our love can conquer

  to say the wedding's off.

     would you like a beer?     

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,800
          No, I'd like          
     a dead cat in a glass.     

34
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,600
         Men, you are looking   
         at one sharp bargainer.

              Carla and Eddie

    and lemon zester.

42
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,900
    So what happened?           

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,700
    Eddie freaked out           
     about being a father?      

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
No.

      Hate at first sight.

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
     Yeah, how'd you know?      

48
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,900
  Well, that's the "law" part   
    of "mother-in-law," see.    

49
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,700
So Eddie's not going            
to marry Carla                  

50
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
because his mother              
doesn't approve.                

51
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
I tell you,                     
it's pathetic                   

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,500
to see a grown man so tied      
to his ma's apron strings.      

53
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,800
     Well, that reminds me,     
 Mr. Clavin, you mother called  

54
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
 and said she couldn't make it  
      for dinner tonight.       

55
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,100
Oh, great. What                 
am I supposed to do

one little condition.           

94

You pull this off and you can   
have anything you want.

99

          you have worked here, 

100
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,700
        you have done nothing   

101
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,900
                 but whine about
                 these uniforms.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
         Now, I put a great deal
         of thought into them   

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,100
        and I happen to think   
        they make a statement.  
Oh, yeah.                       

104
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,800
They say I'm a lima bean.       

105
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,600
All right. Fine, fine.          

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
If you insist on                
keeping these uniforms,         

107
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,700
then there'll be                
no wedding,                     

108
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
no wedding reception,           

109
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
and you and Mr. Drake           
can spend an intimate evening   

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,100
watching 40 quarts              
of guacamole turn black.        

111
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,800

112
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
        Get rid of the uniforms.

113

         Just tell them         
  I'm at Gown-O-Rama, tra-la.   

124
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,100
                  That was all  
                  well and good.

125
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
    Thank you.                  

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,000
 How do you plan on getting the 
 bride and groom back together? 

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
 I'm going to rely on my wits.  

128
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,600
                  Well, you're  
                  halfway there.

129
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
     You better believe it.     

130
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,200
Sam.                            

131
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
 Father Berry at Carla's church 

132
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
      said we gotta hurry       

133
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,400
because he's got                
two weddings                    

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,500
planned after Carla's,          
a bake sale,                    

135
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,400
a slide show of the Knights of  
Columbus' trip to the Holy Land,

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,100
and a CYO hootenanny.           

137
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,400
            Thank you, Woody.   

138
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,900
    Sam?                        
                Mmm?            

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,900
I'm, uh... I'm thinking         
of becoming Catholic.           

140
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,800
      We'll talk about it later.

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,100
    Hey, Sammy, I got Eddie.    

142
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,000
      Great. Where's Mama?      

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,200
     I tipped the cabbie to     
     take her back to the hotel.

144
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,200
                You already paid
                back that buck. 

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not gonna                   
marry her, Sam.                 

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,700
I mean, I can't go              
against <i>mémère's</i> wishes.        

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,100
Maybe some day,                 
after Mama gets to know her     

148
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,100
and starts to like her....      

149
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,100
Wait, wait,                     
wait, wait, wait.               

150
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
          What about the planets
          and the tea leaves?   

151
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
      I mean, if you don't      
         marry her now,         

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,100
      you're going to have      
    to wait till 2042.          

153
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,300
    Sam, it's no use.           

154
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,600
  I mean, maybe Carla's right.  

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
      Ever since I saw her      
      on our wedding day,       

156
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,600
we've had nothing but bad luck. 

157
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,800
    You know, I happen          
  to think that it's bad luck   

158
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
to be a jerk to the woman       
      you're in love with.      

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
            Now, come on, Eddie.

160
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,800
    Just talk to her.           

161
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
     Okay. I guess I could      
    just talk to her.           

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,700
                Great, great,   

163
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,500
      great, great, great,      
    hold that thought.          

164
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,100
How's it going?                 
                    Pretty good,
                    pretty good.

165
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,300
         It better be,          
    or my butt's in a sling.    

166
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,800
Is there room for two in there? 

167
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,400
          Eddie's arm.          

168
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,700
        His neck.               

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
How's it going?                 

170
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
                Oh, not too bad.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
         I don't think          
we've broken anything vital yet.

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
                Eddie's foot.   

173
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
    Sweetheart.                 
                Eddie's femur.  

174
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
    Sit down.                   
    Hey. Stop, stop.            

175
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,700
Would you give the guy          
a break, please?                

176
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,000
He had to break a mirror, right?

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,900
    He had to spill the salt.   

178
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,200
             He had to thumb his
             nose to the Fates, 

179
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,700
         and look what happened.

180
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,000
  They turned him into a wuss.  

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,600
     The important thing is     
    that the wuss came back.    

182
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,300
      Does he have a note       
        from his mommy?         

183
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,400
          Oh, come on,          
     just talk to the guy.      

184
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
            I don't talk to     
            spineless jellyfish.

185
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,100
All right, fine.                
I'll just, uh,                  

186
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,300
          go out there          
     and tell him to leave.     

187
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,500
                    Hey.        

188
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
      Does he look really       
      pathetic and cute?        

189
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,900
 Have you ever seen a puppy...  

190
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,800
          in the rain?          

191
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,400
            Well...             

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
         I guess I can          

193
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,300
     let him off the hook,      
        but first!              

194
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,200
He has to come in here, get down
 on his knees and sweat blood.  

195
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
He was hoping you'd say that.   

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,300
You're smiling.                 

197
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,000
            The wedding's on.   
Oh, yeah.                       

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,500
This uniform is almost off.     

199
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,500
Old engineer Sammy's            
got the matrimony express       

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
right back on schedule.         

201
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,400
      Eddie. Eddie, Eddie.      

202
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
Wait a minute, man. Whoa.       

203
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
                Where you going?

204
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,500
I can't face her                
right now.                      

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,400
I mean, even if I did           
change my mind                  

206
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
and decide                      
to stand up to Mama,            

207
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,300
Carla would never forgive me    
for the way I ran out.          

208
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,000
I mean, if I went               
in there right now,             

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,100
she'd tear my head off.         

210
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
        Come on, Eddie.         

211
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,600
 I think you're underestimating 
     Carla just a bit here.     

212
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,300
What, you don't think           
she'll be mad?                  

213
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,800
    No, I don't think           
she'll stop at your head.       

214
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
SAM:                            
Norm...                         

215
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,000
            Listen, she wants   
            to forgive you.     

216
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,900
    All you two need is a few   
    moments together in private.

217
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay, but could we              
do it out here,                 

218
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,300
where there are                 
plenty of witnesses?            

219
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,600
                All right. Okay.

220
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,900
Just sit down right here. Relax.

221
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
If he even looks at the door,   
break his legs.                 

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,700
              Sam!              

223
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,100
The wedding frock               
you ordered.                    

224
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,300
 I got some pretty weird looks  
  on the bus with this thing.   

225
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,000
There was also one              
rather interesting invitation.  

226
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
              Sam.              

227
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
Father Berry.                   

228
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,800
The other wedding party's       

229
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,700
      starting to stack up      
    in the vestibule.           

230
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,500
        Ah, I can't talk        
        to him now, man.        

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
 I-I gotta talk to Eddie here.  

232
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,800
    I just talked to Eddie.     

233
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,200
     I gotta talk to Carla.     

234
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,300
Carla?                          
                    Mm-hmm.     

235
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
        Carla.                  

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
         Father Berry?          

237
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,400
     Listen, Sam can't talk     
     right now, but, uh...      

238
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,700
 while I got you on the phone,  
can I ask you a question?       

239
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,000
      Do you have to pay        
      any membership dues       

240
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,600
    to be a Catholic?           

241
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,400
                     I told you 
                     I wouldn't 
                     talk to him

242
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
                unless he comes 
                in here begging.

243
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,400
    Come on. Carla, we don't    
  have time for this nonsense.  

244
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,800
Hey, I got an idea.             

245
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Get out of your clothes.        

246

        Oh, Sammy,              
  any other time I'd love to,   

247
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,100
         but, really...         

248
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
    Well, I just think that,    
  you know, uh, you're sweaty.  

249
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,500
You're tired,

      into something else.

Well, hey, like this,           
for instance.                   

252
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,900
            No way.

          Oh, come on.          
     Just, just try it on.      

254

You know, see how it fits       

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
        in case you want        
    to get married someday.

258
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 I might not be pregnant then.  

259
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
             Right.

262
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,300
            This might be the   
            last chance I get   

263
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,600
        to see what I look      
        like in one of these.

 I know what you're doing here.

                take one look   
                in the mirror

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,300
                and I'm going

Yeah, that's basically it.

286
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,100
No, no. I don't say

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,600
        It's not an ugly thing. 

368
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
                It's a Wabby.   

369
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,600
What's a Wabby, Webecca?        

370
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,700
        It's a "Women of Boston 
        Business" award.        

371
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,300
        I'm very proud of it.   

372
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
            It happens to be    
            very prestigious.   

373
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,700
            Thousands of women  
            have won it.        

374
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,400
What's it doing                 
out here?                       

375
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,600
You trying                      
to impress your boss?           

376
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,700
                I'm glad        
                you reminded me.

377
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,500
        I'm completely          
        forgot he was coming.   

378
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Yeah, sure you did.             

379
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Hey, you know,                  

380
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
every time Evan Drake's name    
gets mentioned                  

381
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,100
you get a little red            
around the gills.               

382
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,000
Do you have                     
a crush on him                  
or something?                   

383
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,600
            I beg your pardon.  

384
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,400
                He happens to be
                a married man.  

385
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,800
        Although not happily.   

386
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, you <i>do</i> have a crush on him. 

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
        How cute!               

388
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
"Oh, Evan, Evan."               

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Great stuffed mushrooms,        
Cliffie.                        

390
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,100
                Try the Swedish 
                meatballs.      

391
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,800
                They're out     
                of this world.  

392
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,900
        Yeah.                   

393
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,300
Ooh, try 'em together!          
Together!                       

394
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,000
     Excuse me, gentlemen.      

395
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
     Do you plan on leaving     

396
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,100
    any hors d'oeuvres          
        for latecomers?         

397
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
        Hey, you snooze,        
        you lose.               

398
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
Ooh-ooh! Rumaki!                

399
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,500
Come on.                        

400
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,400
    And now it's time           
for the traditional first dance,

401
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,200
  and we all know who's going   
          to start it.          

402
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,600
 Holy cow, it isn't me, is it?  

403
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,100
Let's welcome                   

404
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,800
the happy couple Carla and Eddie
to the dance floor.             

405
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300
      ¶ The greatest love       
    the world has known... ¶    

406
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,100
Hit me again, Harley.           

407
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,900
    Third time's the charm.     

408
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,300
            So, uh, where's your
            big-shot lover boy? 

409
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,900
A: I told you                   
he is not my lover boy.         

410
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,400
B: The big shot SOB             
is in a meeting.                

411
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,100
C: Choke on it.                 

412
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,300
     There's a happy pair.      

413
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
    Say cheeseburger.           

414
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,400
                    Uh, no, no. 

415
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,600
        All right,              
      that was a good one,      

416
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,700
even with Miss Howe's eyes      
     kinda gimpy like that.     

417
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,800
                Oh, Norm, look. 

418
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,700
            We forgot about     
            the dessert table.  

419
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,300
        And we call ourselves   
        guests.                 

420
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,300
            Ma, you want        
            to trade partners?  

421
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,900
            Why not?            
            I'm going to die.   

422
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,200
            I'm going to dance  
            with my mother,     
            all right?          

423
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,500
                How about a cup 
                of coffee, huh? 

424
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,300
      Why would I do that?      

425
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,600
    Well, because I've seen     

426
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,500
      a lot of ladies hit       
the champagne in my time.       

427
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,500
                One minute      
                they're doing   
                just fine.      

428
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,900
            The next minute     
            it kind of sneaks   
            up on them          

429
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,800
            and they're doing   
            all sorts           

430
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,500
      of wild and crazy...      

431
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,100
  Why <i>am</i> I giving you coffee?   

432
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,400
                    So, Eddie,  

433
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,800
        what's Mother Tortelli  
        like in bed?            

434
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,100
                    What are you
                    looking at, 
                    pretty lady?

435
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm looking at you.             

436
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
            Well, I'm looking   
            back at you.        

437
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,600
I think I'm beginning           
to see you                      

438
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,500
in a whole new light.           

439
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,800
        Why don't you tell me   
        what you see?           

440
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
You have a really weird face.   

441
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,700
Your eyebrows                   
are growing together            

442
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,500
like a big old                  
ugly caterpillar.               

443
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,700
Oh, look,                       
they're cutting the cake.       

444
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,400
And now as the hour draws late, 

445
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,900
    it's time for the bride     
     to throw the bouquet.      

446
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
    Okay, come on, come on,     
        everybody.              

447
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,300
                You all ready?  

448
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,000
                Okay, heads up, 
                you old maids.  

449
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,300
        Dr. Crane,              
        a girl's supposed       
        to catch the bouquet.   

450
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,900
Well, then the girls            
should have been                

451
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,100
a little bit quicker.           

452
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,000
                Here, knock     
                yourself out.   

453
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,400
    I think it's time           
     for me to pack it in.      

454
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Uh, you know,                   
I don't think                   

455
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
you're in any condition         
to drive, Miss Howe.            

456
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,800
Let me give you                 
a lift home, all right?         

457
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,000
         I don't know.          

458
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,100
 I've never been alone in a car 
     with such a hairy guy.     

459
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,600
    Are you sure you weren't    
    in <i>The Planet of The Apes?</i>  

460
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,900
            Can anybody else    
            please take me home?

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,100
There's room in our car.        

462
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,600
You can sit on my lap.          

463
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,100
                Darling, you're 
                married now.    

464
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,700
                You don't have  
                a lap.          

465
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,900
Come on.                        
You think I'm so ugly?          

466
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
I'll let you get a bag          

467
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,400
and put it over my head,        
all right?                      

468
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
         Just a minute.         
    Let me get my bag.          

469
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,700
        And yours.              

470
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,400
         I'm not crazy          
about the way that girl flirts. 

471
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,700
And now, folks,                 

472
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,000
 as the lucky couple gets ready 

473
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
        to embark               
  on their new life together,   

474
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,000
let's all throw some rice,      
    the symbol of fertility.    

475
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,300
                    Ow!         

476
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
                        Oh, ow! 

477
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,600
                    Ah!         

478
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,900
I can't go                      
out here, Eddie.                

479
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
                            Why?

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No, it's too dangerous.         

481
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
                    I'm okay.   

482
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
Who are we trying               
to kid here?                    

483
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,600
We're living                    
in the shadow                   
of the curse                    

484
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
we brought                      
on ourselves.                   

485
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't go on                   
with this.                      

486
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
                Come on, Carla. 

487
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
          No, no, no.           

488
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,800
                I think maybe   
                we should get   
                an annulment.   

489
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,200
            Oh, would you two   
            stop it?!           

490
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
    I can't believe...          

491
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
  This should be the happiest   
    day of your lives,          

492
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,500
      and all you've done       
    is moan and groan           

493
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,400
                all day long.   
                I mean, come on.

494
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
  It's one thing to play along  

495
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,200
  with this superstition stuff  
  for, you know, for some fun,  

496
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,700
     but you're letting it      
        interfere               

497
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,300
with your happiness here.       

498
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,200
                You two         
                are wonderful.  

499
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,600
            You got everything  
            in your life        

500
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
            to look forward to. 

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,200
    Please, please, come on.    
        Trust me.               

502
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,700
Nothing bad is going to happen. 

503
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,200
        ( <i>phone rings</i> )         

504
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,500
    You got my personal word    
            on that.            

505
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I mean, superstition,           
it's for the birds.             

506
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,300
Just go on                      
with your normal life.          

507
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,000
Woody, do you mind?             

508
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,100
All right, fine.                
Go ahead. Answer it.            

509
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
It's probably                   
just somebody who wants         

510
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,700
to, uh, know what time          
the bar closes.                 

511
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,900
            We close at 2:00.   

512
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
            Eddie, it's for you.

513
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,500
                Some guy        
                from the Bruins.

514
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,600
Maybe, maybe you oughta...      

515
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,800
Probably just want              
to congratulate me              
on my wedding.                  

516
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,700
Yeah, right.                    
That's it. That's it.           

517
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
        Hello.                  

518
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,100
        Oh, hiya, Frank         

519
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
     Yeah, how's it going?      

520
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,500
It's Frank.                     

521
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,800
Yeah,                           

522
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,000
            uh-huh.             

523
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,200
            Uh-huh.             

524
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,000
            Uh-huh.             

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,900
Okay, yeah.                     

526
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,400
Yeah, thanks a lot.             

527
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Good-bye, Frank.                

528
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
Do I smell a bonus?             

529
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,800
They cut me from the team.      

530
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,700
They're going                   
with the youth movement.        

531
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,500
They tried to trade me,         
but nobody wanted me.           

532
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,600
    I'm sorry, Carla.           

533
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
            I guess             
     all the superstitions      

534
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,200
    finally caught up           
            with us.            

535
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,100
Wait a minute.                  
Wait a minute.                  

536
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,300
I can blame a lot               
of things on superstition,      

537
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
but you aren't                  
the greatest goalie             
in the world, honey.            

538
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,100
            What are you saying 
            to me, Carla?       

539
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,100
Well, you know,                 
the end of last year            
you were losing it,             

540
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,900
and now you're older,           
and your reflexes are shot.     

541
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,700
            Oh, thanks a lot.   

542
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,500
            I'm feeling a lot   
            better already.     

543
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,900
And if that wasn't              
because of superstition,        

544
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,000
then maybe the twins            
aren't bad luck either.         

545
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Could it be possible            

546
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,500
that I'm just having twins      
    because the eggs split?     

547
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
          Whoa, whoa!           

548
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,700
 And maybe your mother hates me 
     because she's stupid.      

549
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,800
     And Anthony hates you      

550
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,500
     because he takes after     
 his no-good rat-faced father.  

551
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,100
      And all those things      
 that we thought were bad luck  

552
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
    had nothing to do           
    with superstition.          

553
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,000
         It was just...         

554
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
             life.              

555
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,700
         Unfortunately,         
it happens to be my life.       

556
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,300
         What the heck?         

557
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,200
    I'm married and in love     
    with a great guy.           

558
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,200
So, I guess                     
that evens things up.           

559
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
No, it doesn't.                 

560
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,400
But it makes life worth living. 

561
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
        No, it doesn't.         

562
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
But it's something.             

563
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,800
    So let's get on with it.    

564
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,500
What do you say,                
hubby?                          

565
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,200
        I say let's get on      
        with the honeymoon, eh? 

566
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,400
See you at 2:00 A.M.            

567
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,700
Somebody's got to work          
in this family.                 

568
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Hi. I'm Mrs. Eddie LeBec.       

569
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,500
What'll you have?               

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,109
