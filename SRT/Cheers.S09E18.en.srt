00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,000
        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,300
          Another beer, Sam.    

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,600
     Uh, put it on my tab.      

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,200
        Actually, Paul,         
    we don't run tabs here.     

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,900
        What do you mean        
    you don't run tabs here?    

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,400
    Norm Peterson has a tab     
     the size of his pants.     

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,700
Well, that's, that's Norm.      

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,900
      Well, this is Paul.       

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,900
     Come on, Norm doesn't      
    have much in life,          

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
         except Cheers.         

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,700
         What about me?         
        I'm unemployed.         

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,000
     I don't like <i>my</i> wife.      

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,400
    You're putting me           
     in a tough spot here.      

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
        I'm sorry, Sam,         
      I really want a tab.      

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,700
Yeah, I want a tab, too.        

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,100
MAN:                            
Hey, you guys                   
are getting tabs?               

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,100
                 Hey, everybody,
         we're all getting tabs.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,400
No, you're not.                 
Put that back.                  

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,700
     Paul, you see what...      

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,300
  Sam, I'm sitting here         
    until I get a tab.          

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
                    What are you
                  talking about?

22
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,500
                    Paul doesn't
                have a tab here?

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,900
                         Please.

24
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,100
              This is one of our

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,400
                      most loyal
            customers for years.

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,100
        If anyone deserves a tab
    in this joint, it's Paul.   

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,700
        All right.              

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,300
We'll run a tab for Paul.       

29
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, thanks, Norm.              

30
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,400
                Can I have beer,
        please, Sam, and, uh,   

31
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,200
                why don't we put
            it on Paul's tab?   

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
      (theme song begins)       

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,500
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,700
 Takes everything you've got  

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,400
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,800
 Sure would help a lot         

37
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,700
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,300
   Sometimes you want to go    

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,800
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

40
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,700
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,900
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,800
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

45
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,200
   People are all the same     

46
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,900
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
          Carla, it's           
    the first of the month.     

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,100
Where's my rent check           

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,600
        for the poolroom        
    and the bathrooms?          

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,300
         Here you are.          

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,900
         Buy yourself a melon in
    case you misplace your head.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,900
         Thank you.             

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,400
Tell me, Carla,                 
clinically speaking,            

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,000
are you considered              
a dwarf or a midget?            

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,600
    Say, is that your head or is
     your neck blowing a bubble?

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
Somebody phone                  
the authorities in Paris.       

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,400
A gargoyle has just             
fallen off Notre Dame           

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,400
and is now taking               
drink orders.                   

60
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,100
                You know, two   
                 heads like that

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,700
                    would make a
            perfectly good butt.

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,300
         Shrike.                
                 Bullet head.   

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,700
        Slattern.               
                 Hatchet face.  

64
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,400
Well, must be off.              

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
Till next month, then.          

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
He's good people.               

67
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
          Hey, Carla.           

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,800
What's the matter, Eefus?       

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,600
          Well, you served table
three's drinks to table five.   

70
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,400
         That's a five?         

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,700
      Yeah, can't you read that?

72
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,600
                          CLIFF:
                    Aw, it's not
              surprising, Woody.

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
 Carla's reaching               
 that age                       

74
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 where the lens of the cornea   
 loses its elasticity.          

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They do say that the eye        
is the first to go.             

76
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
(chuckles)                      

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
        Keep it up              

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
and your teeth will be          
the first to go.                

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,200
That was clearly                
a three there, Eefus.           

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Get your orders straight.       

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,700
Good morning.                   

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000
                Hey, Rebecca,   

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
        you got to get on the   
     phone with the distributor.

84
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
I'm still out of vermouth.      

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
          Yeah, yeah,           
  I'll do that this afternoon.  

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
    I have to work on           
my own plans this morning.      

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,700
      Your plans for what?      

88
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,400
    For what I'm going to do    

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,400
      when I buy your bar.      

90
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,900
          (laughing):           
    Oh, those plans, right.     

91
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh, how can I forget that?      

92
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,300
You're not taking me seriously, 
         are you, Sam?          

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
        No, no, I'm not.        
          No, I'm not.          

94
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,600
You, the bar owner.             

95
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,900
     "Hi, I'm Rebecca Howe.     

96
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,200
      "Welcome to my bar.       

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,800
     "Gee, you know, we're      
a little low on vermouth today. 

98
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,100
     "Maybe I ought to get      
  on the phone and order some   

99
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,600
"because, after all,            
this is...                      

100
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
                 my bar."       

101
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
That is not funny.              

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
 Yeah, well, I guess to get it, 

103
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,500
  you'd have to be a bar owner  
    or out of vermouth          

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,300
            and I'm both,       
             so order it.       

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
              Sam, I am prepared
                     to make you

106
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,500
              a legitimate offer
                    on this bar.

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,900
                 I can offer you
         $25,000 cash right now.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,200
How about $15,000 in cash       
and $10,000 in vermouth?!       

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,500
    Sam, I'm serious.           

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Where are you going to get      
that kind of money?             

111
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,600
                     (scoffing):
                I have a degree.

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,000
            I'm a businesswoman.

113
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,300
    I just spent the last ten   
years in a major corporation.   

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
                      My daddy's
                giving it to me.

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
He's just giving it to you?     

116
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,900
            Well, no, we have   
                an agreement.   

117
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,300
                    He agreed to
            give me the money   

118
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
                 and I agreed to
        never again come home   

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,500
    and cry so hard that I throw
         up at the dinner table.

120
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,300
  This is a bit of a surprise,  
    isn't it, Rebecca?          

121
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
Why do you want Cheers?         
I would think                   

122
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,800
for you this bar would only have

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,900
     negative associations      
    connected with it.          

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Well, think of all the          
heartbreak you've had here,     

125
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,000
      the forgotten goals,      
the missed opportunities.       

126
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
        Hey, it's called        
    atmosphere, babe.           

127
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,600
     I would think for you      

128
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,900
     this place would have      
     the stench of failure.     

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,900
No, that's Clavin,              

130
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,200
and F.Y.I.,                     
it's not just failure.          

131
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,000
                    You know,   
            actually, Lilith,   

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
          I had more productive,
      successful times at Cheers

133
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
          than I've had anyplace
                else in my life.

134
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,700
         Dear God.              

135
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,000
      Oh, I'm sorry.            

136
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,900
      I was thinking            
    of something else.          

137
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,200
        Sweetheart, I-I think   
             it's a great idea--

138
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,500
                you know, you   
            running a business--

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
                  but you got to
        understand something.   

140
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,700
        This bar is not for sale
     at any price, end of story.

141
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you really mean that?        

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Because I'm not going to come   
to you with this offer again.   

143
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
            Well, I'll just have
              to live with that.

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,500
                I-I-I'll hold   
                  it in my heart

145
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
            and remember all the
         laughter it brought me.

146
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,200
                  Oh, and by the
                  way, you know,

147
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,500
that vermouth is not going to   
    order itself, there, Sparky.

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
         Sam!                   

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,300
                        (laughs)
        Come on.                

150
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,800
                      I'm sorry.

151
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,500
        You're right, I'm not   
      taking you seriously here.

152
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
                     I got to be
                     supportive.

153
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,700
                  All right, uh,
                  tell you what.

154
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,900
    I will sell you this bar.   

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
        You will?               
                        Yeah.   

156
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,400
                 What would be a
                fair price here?

157
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,300
                  We got liquor,
            glasses, bar stools.

158
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,500
            Oh, I don't know,   
          let's say $25 million.

159
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,300
         Come on, Sam.          

160
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,200
    Oh, don't be so negative.   

161
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
         Here, I'll show you how
            supportive I can be.

162
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,700
     All right, let's take      
 a collection here for Rebecca. 

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,100
    I need a tin can.           

164
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,100
Oh, yeah, here we go, all right.
                        Hey, yo,
                         yo, yo.

165
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
Whoop-- all right, there you go.

166
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,900
Okay, let's help, uh,           

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
 Rebecca pay for this bar here. 

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,300
 I'll tell you what, I am going 
to put in a nickel myself.      

169
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,500
                Now, can anyone,

170
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
        uh, match that?         

171
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Anybody?                        

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,100
        Ooh, not looking        
        good here, babe.        

173
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,000
I hope you're having fun.       

174
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,900
    Actually, I'm not.          

175
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,200
You know, fund-raising          
is really hard work.            

176
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,600
I must be doing somethin' right.

177
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,300
A guy just gave me a ten dollar 
     tip on a $30 bar tab.      

178
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,400
                That's a single.

179
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
            Oh, man.            

180
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,700
     Well, I might as well      
      get this over with.       

181
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,100
      Woody, cover for me.      

182
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I shouldn't put this off        
any longer.                     

183
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
    There you go, now you're    
     thinking there, Carla.     

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Get those eyes checked out      
        properly.               

185
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,800
    Forget that.                

186
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm going to run the cheapskate 
        over like a dog.        

187
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
    Well, if your eyes          
    are in such great shape,    

188
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,300
     then how come you took     
    my car keys by mistake?     

189
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,400
      That was no mistake.      

190
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,300
You think I want his blood      
     and hair on <i>my</i> fender?     

191
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,400
                    Oh, I see   
                     a starfish.

192
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
                          CLIFF:
    I think it's a manta ray.   

193
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,100
  You showing ink blots again,  
        Dr. Crane?              

194
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
              Uh, no, Woody.    

195
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,500
    We are engaged in something 
        far more challenging    

196
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
          than anything Hermann 
     Rorschach ever dreamed up. 

197
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,600
    That's right, Wood, we're   
            trying to figure out

198
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,900
     the five hidden pictures on
    Melville's kiddie place mat.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,700
SAM:                            
Okay, boys.                     

200
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
                  Tell you what,
                let's check, uh,

201
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
      Rebecca's tote board here,

202
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,400
        ladies and gentlemen.   

203
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,500
      All right, you can see her
    goal here of $25 million.   

204
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,700
Let's check that                
against                         

205
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,000
            the grand total of--
             whoo-- two nickels!

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
                 All right!     

207
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,000
                     Whoo!      

208
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,500
        Uh-oh, wait a minute,   
                  wait a minute.

209
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
              That confetti just
              cost you a nickel.

210
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,000
                 Promotion's not
                 free, you know.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,800
        Your jokes              

212
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
                 are so childish
                    and moronic.

213
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,800
Well, that's what keeps me      
          young, babe.          

214
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,100
        (both laughing)         
                            MAN:
                        Rebecca.

215
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
REBECCA:                        
Oh, Harry, I'm glad             
you're here. Sam.               

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
        This is my appraiser,   
                      he's going

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,900
to tell me how much             
this bar is really worth.       

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
      Well, I'll save you       
some trouble here, Harry.       

219
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,800
 The bar is worth $25 million.  

220
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,000
        Well, Rebecca, I need   
         to work up the figures,

221
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,500
            but everything seems
            to be in good shape.

222
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,200
         Except for that strange
                floor deformity.

223
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
     What floor deformity?      

224
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,100
            There seems to be   
              a depression here.

225
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,400
                  It's almost as
            if this bar stool   

226
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,400
                is sinking right
                 into the earth.

227
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600
                I wonder what   
            could cause that.   

228
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,800
      Uh, pardon me, pal.       

229
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,900
You're standing between me      
     and my cheese doodles.     

230
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,600
         You know, uh,          

231
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,600
I don't think that a ground     
surface irregularity            

232
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,600
of this nature                  
is so strange.                  

233
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,600
I mean, after all,              

234
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,500
the entire east coast           
is sinking.                     

235
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
We all know that.               

236
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,300
I mean, due to global warming,  
the polar ice caps are melting  

237
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,100
and, hey, we're gonna be        
all underwater anyway.          

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,300
Yeah, that's why I, uh,         

239
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
like to keep a couple           
of cans of tuna                 

240
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
and an inflatable raft          
in the trunk of my car.         

241
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,400
Wait a second, I ate the tuna   
a couple of nights ago.         

242
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,400
I'd better go out               
and get some more.              

243
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Boy, if that flood              
comes tonight,                  

244
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I'm really going                
to kick myself.                 

245
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,000
                Harry...        

246
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
  do you think you have enough  
 figures to run the appraisal?  

247
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,500
                  Well, just one
                  more question.

248
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,800
        Is that mailman going to
         be hanging around here?

249
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
         I don't know.          

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,400
              Well, I'll run the
              figures both ways.

251
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,600
Honey, you're wasting your money
running an appraisal like this. 

252
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,200
        Remember,               
 you only got one nickel left.  

253
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,700
(huffing):                      
Sam, you know what?             

254
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,300
         You never take anything
                I say seriously.

255
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,100
        Take this seriously.    

256
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
          I will have this bar. 

257
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,000
You're right,                   
I'm sorry.                      

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,900
From now on, I'm going          
to take you seriously.          

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,700
                         Good.  

260
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,400
(in low voice):                 
This is me taking Rebecca       
seriously.                      

261
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,200
        Come on, guys, let's all
         take Rebecca seriously.

262
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,300
        (in low voice):         
All right, Sam, well, I'm going 
    to be very serious now.     

263
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,500
                 (in low voice):
            Well, what the heck?
     This is a very serious bar.

264
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
        I'd like a very         
     serious beer, please.      

265
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,200
    (Sam and Norm laughing)     

266
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,900
     No, I'm serious, Sam,      
         I'd like one.          

267
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,200
You guys                        
are such...                     

268
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
                Excuse me, Miss.

269
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,500
                         Is this
                    total right?

270
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,300
          Yeah.                 

271
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,100
What was that?                  

272
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,200
            Nothing.            

273
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,600
There was something across      
the bridge of your nose.        

274
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,500
It was horn-rimmed              
and a little Coke bottle-ish.   

275
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
        All right, I went to one
        of those one-hour joints

276
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,700
         and I got myself a pair
             of reading glasses.

277
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,900
But if I hear one single        
comment about Ben Franklin      

278
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,100
or Granny or "four eyes,"       

279
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I will cut out your tongue      
    and fry it up for lunch.    

280
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
                (muffled laughs)

281
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
                      (laughing)

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,500
                      (laughing)

283
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,500
                I don't care.   
            It's worth a tongue.

284
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,000
            Oh darn.            

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
    These glasses have          
        a spot on them.         

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,600
         That's better.         

287
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
(laughing)                      

288
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,800
    This is so funny!           

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,300
                    What are you
                     doing, Sam?
Huh?                            

290
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,300
Oh, I'm, uh, faking a letter    
from the IRS here saying        

291
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,700
that Rebecca overpaid           
her return last year.           

292
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,600
    So the government           
now owes her $25 million.       

293
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,500
             Sam...             

294
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,300
     Well, it could happen!     

295
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
Come on! Give me a break.       

296
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,600
I think your humor is expressing

297
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,000
    a hidden hostility          
        toward Rebecca.         

298
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,700
Or perhaps, deep down, you fear 

299
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,200
     she really is capable      
  of taking this bar from you.  

300
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,400
     Put a suit on a woman      
and she thinks she's God.       

301
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,600
                        Frasier,
                are you going   

302
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,600
to let him                      
talk to me like this?           

303
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,000
             She's also this way

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
                when the suit   
                 comes off, Sam.

305
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
              You should see her
                  rule the roost

306
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,900
         in her bra and panties.

307
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
         Well, well...          

308
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,300
        well, hey,              
    it's a compliment, baby!    

309
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,000
          (laughing):           
              Oh!               

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
      Hey, listen to this!      

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
  "P.S. Order some vermouth."   

312
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
    (hysterically laughing)     

313
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,000
                  Sam.          
Yeah?                           

314
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,000
I've always known that you felt 
  that my owning the pool room  

315
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,000
 and bathrooms was an unwieldy  
          arrangement.          

316
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,800
     So I found a solution.     

317
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,000
        Oh, good. What?         

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,700
I've agreed to sell             
them to Rebecca.                

319
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,700
        I hope you can afford   
              the new rent, Sam,

320
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,500
     but if you have any trouble

321
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,200
             maybe you can throw
              a little telethon.

322
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,200
                  Tell you what.

323
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
          (low voice):          
I'm willing to donate a nickel. 

324
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
        Oh, no, no, no.         

325
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
This is not                     
gonna happen here.              

326
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,400
Listen, if you want to sell     
these rooms to somebody,        

327
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,800
sell them to me.                

328
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,100
I mean, whatever she offered    
you, I'll pay more.             

329
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,400
     Oh, really?                

330
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,300
Why? Wait a minute.             
What-What did she offer you?    

331
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,200
    I offered him the $25,000   
              my father gave me.

332
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,200
Sam, do you have a father?      

333
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
             Hold it. Excuse me.
                  Wait a minute.

334
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
        You accepted my deal.   

335
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,400
                You said, "Yes."

336
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,400
     "Yes" can mean             
     so many things.            

337
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,200
You see, you see                
what she's trying               

338
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
to do here,                     
don't you, John?                

339
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
I mean, if she gets a hold      
    of those bathrooms          

340
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,300
 and the pool room, she, she'll 
take the whole bar from me      

341
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
    and she's gonna ruin me.    

342
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,100
     Oh, I'm all a tingle.      

343
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
     All right. All right.      

344
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,500
Uh, how much did she offer you? 

345
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
            $25,000.            

346
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,300
     All right. All right.      

347
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,400
  Uh, $25,000 and one dollar.   

348
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,700
No, no, $20.                    

349
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,100
     Yeah. $25,000 and $20.     

350
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,400
    Let's see you beat that.    

351
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,100
            $30,000.            

352
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,900
      I thought, I thought      
    we were going up in $20.    

353
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,700
It seems we have two interested 
         parties here.          

354
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
Perhaps I should                
give it to the one              

355
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,700
                    who wants it
                    the most.   

356
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,000
    The party who's willing     
     to go that extra mile.     

357
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,900
    Oh, dear, I notice          
     my shoelace is untied.     

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,300
Oh, give me                     
a break!                        

359
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,900
You expect one of us to get down
     on our hands and knees     

360
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,200
     and tie your shoelace      
so you can give them the rooms? 

361
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
                Oh, well to hell
            with you, Mister.   

362
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,400
             You know, nothing's
                     worth that.

363
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,700
         Oh, Christmas is coming
                early this year.

364
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,400
  Ah, Woody, if you see Hill,   
    give him his keys,          

365
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,100
     tell him I'm finished,     
        all right?              

366
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,900
        Oh, Sammy, you didn't   
          wash his car, did you?

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,700
 Hey, what do you take me for?  

368
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,400
  I detailed every inch of it.  

369
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,100
Hey, Carla,                     

370
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,300
I heard the guys were kidding   
you about your glasses.         

371
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
But I want you to know,         

372
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,300
I think it makes you look       
a lot more intellectual.        

373
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
                  Thanks, Woody.

374
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,100
In fact, they...                

375
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,400
they kind of make you           
look like Einstein.             

376
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,100
                Thanks a lot.   
    Yeah,                       

377
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,200
if you could just get your      
hair to do what his does.       

378
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,200
Well, actually,                 
it almost does.                 

379
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
            Whoa, whoa, whoa!   

380
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
                         Why me?

381
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
        I have to work with him.

382
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
      Oh, boy, Miss Howe!       

383
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,000
                      When I see
                         a woman

384
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,900
  in a hot little black dress   
        like that,              

385
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,100
 all I can think of is "zowie," 

386
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,300
        and "who died?"         

387
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
            Oh, Sam!            

388
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
      I want to thank you       
     for washing John's car     

389
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
          because after he cooks
          dinner for me tonight,

390
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,600
                he might want me
            to go dancing and...

391
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,600
    I want us to look good.     

392
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
    Oh, that's great.           

393
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,900
      I-I send him flowers      
and he takes you dancing.       

394
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,900
              Men.              

395
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
                 You know, also,

396
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,600
you can wax John's car          

397
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
and you can do                  
his menial tasks,               

398
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,500
but I have something            
you don't have.                 

399
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
See you later...                

400
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
    or in the morning.          

401
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,500
What does she mean              
by that,                        

402
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,500
she has something               
you don't have?                 

403
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,500
She's got nice hair,            
you got nice hair.              

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,800
She's got nice eyes,            
you got nice eyes.              

405
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,000
She's got...                    

406
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,200
Uh-oh, Sam.                     

407
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
You're in big trouble.          

408
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,300
That was a very nice            
meal, Mr. Hill.                 

409
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,700
                      Thank you.

410
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
I only wish that I could have   
cooked it for you.              

411
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,600
        Oh, well,               
  I didn't want to disturb you  

412
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
      while you were doing      
          the windows.          

413
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,800
Why don't we just sit here      
    a while and enjoy           

414
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,000
                  a little wine,

415
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,200
before you do the dishes.       

416
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,500
     Mmm, you know, John...     

417
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,700
        I really deserve        
    that property downstairs    

418
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,000
      more than Sam does.       

419
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,200
Well, deserving something       

420
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
         and earning it         
are two different things.       

421
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,300
     Well, you know, John,      

422
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,800
        if you did              
     sell me the property,      

423
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,500
I would be a very friendly      
        neighbor.               

424
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
And I'm sure                    
we could come                   

425
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
to some mutual agreement.       

426
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,900
    You do know what I mean,    
        don't you?              

427
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,700
(glassed and dishes shattering) 

428
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,300
 Oh, I'll clean that up later.  

429
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,900
    Don't worry about that,     

430
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,900
 we have a real estate purchase 
          to consider.          

431
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,300
    In fact, why don't we go    
      into the next room.       

432
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
  We can get under the sheets   
          and haggle.           

433
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,700
        Right now?              

434
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,300
        I'm ready.              

435
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,100
Oh, gee, John.                  

436
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,100
    I think that stain          
     is gonna set in here.      

437
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm willing to throw            
caution to the wind             

438
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,100
and say I'll risk               
my carpet.                      

439
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
     We really need to put      
        something on it.        

440
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,300
    Very well. How about us?    

441
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
             Eww...             

442
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
              Oh.               

443
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,000
                         I mean,

444
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,000
         as enchanting          
    as that offer is, John,     

445
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
I-I really think club soda      
    would be more effective.    

446
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh, you're into club soda,      
            are you?            

447
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
No, not really, I just...       

448
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,600
        (softly):               
  What can that possibly mean?  

449
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,000
     Come to Papa, Peaches.     

450
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400
              Oh, no, no, don't,
                  wait, hold it.

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,200
    You know, there's a joint   
         right around the corner

452
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,600
      and they sell these carpet
              cleaning machines.

453
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,100
        This hot water shoots   
         right into the bristles

454
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,500
            and it really cleans
                     it up fast!

455
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
Sounds like fun.                
                    No, I really
                better be going.

456
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,800
          You're fast.          

457
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,900
                 And agile.     

458
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
    (knocking at door)          

459
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Yes! Come in!                   

460
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,700
                         Oh! Oh!

461
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,500
            Rebecca. Rebecca.   
                        Rebecca.

462
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
Sam, I'm really glad to see you.

463
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,400
             I'm just glad      
          I got here in time.   

464
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,900
         I mean, you see what   
         he's driving you to,   

465
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,200
don't you? You're throwing      
    yourself at a man           

466
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,400
             just to gain       
        material things.        

467
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,100
        You know what that      
         makes you, don't you?  

468
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Ahead in the race to get a pool 
    room and two bathrooms.     

469
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,500
    Come on, Rebecca.           

470
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
    Yeah, you just stay out     
    of this will you, John?     

471
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,900
  Honey, go downstairs,         

472
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
wipe that makeup off,           
will you?                       

473
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,400
  I tell you what,              

474
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,400
why don't you put on            
a nice dress or something,      

475
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
maybe call your Mom.            

476
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,900
Bet it's been a while,          
hasn't it?                      

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,900
                      Yeah, yes,
                    Sam, it has.

478
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
          Yeah, yeah.           

479
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,900
Actually it's been a while      
    for me, too, Sam.           

480
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,200
  Thanks for spoiling what was  
 going to be a lovely evening.  

481
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,900
         That certainly         
    endears you to me.          

482
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,700
     I just have two words      
         for you, John.         

483
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,400
          What's that?          
             Twins.             

484
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
    Come on in, girls.          

485
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
    Here's Johnny!              

486
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,400
                 How do you like
              these, Johnny boy?

487
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,400
    Go ahead and touch 'em.     
         They're real.          

488
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,500
            Oh, I just forgot   
                        my...   

489
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
                         Wha... 

490
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,400
                Who are they?   
             Uh...              

491
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,100
  this is not what you think.   

492
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,500
Gee, we never met a big         
Hollywood producer before.      

493
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,400
        All right, it's,        
      it's what you think.      

494
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,700
                  Sam, Sam, look
                          at us.
        I know, I know.         

495
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,700
                Do you know what
                he's doing here?
      Yeah.                     

496
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,300
                 He's playing us
             against each other.

497
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,800
You're right.                   
This is disgusting.             

498
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
You can't make us act           
like this.                      

499
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You know something? You can     
keep those stupid old rooms.    

500
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
All bets are off.               
Come on, let's go.              

501
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,900
  I'm sorry you feel that way.  

502
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,900
  So did Sam explain the part   
     you'll be reading for?     

503
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
                     Oh, Sam.   

504
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
             I can't believe you
            could sink this low.

505
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,900
You should have seen me         
in my prime.                    

506
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
             JOHN:              
              Sam.              

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
  Oh, get out of here,          
    will you, Hill?             

508
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,400
    We don't want your type     
      around here anymore.      

509
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
        You're bad news.        

510
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,800
                    Bad news.   

511
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
 I just came down to thank you  

512
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
    for introducing me          
     to Hope and Joy, Sam.      

513
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
 It's very hard to make friends 
         in a new town.         

514
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,400
 The least I can do is sell you 

515
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,700
         the pool room          
    and the bathrooms.          

516
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,700
As I recall,                    
the last                        

517
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,700
    offer was, uh, $30,000.     

518
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
             Yeah, but,         

519
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
     but I don't have $30,000.  

520
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,000
     How much do you have?      

521
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,300
             $5,000.            

522
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,100
        I'm sorry, Sam.         
It's simply out of the question.

523
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,900
      Yeah, but wait a minute,  
    I-I detailed your car.      

524
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,100
                      Wait, wait
                  a minute, Sam.

525
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
                     You do have
                        $30,000.

526
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,600
Oh, wow.                        

527
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,300
Rebecca, you'd do this          
for me?                         

528
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200
             I'd do this for us.

529
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,300
                      A business
            partnership, Sam.   

530
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
    We should have thought of   
          it in the first place.

531
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
      Oh, yeah.                 

532
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
Wh... yeah,                     
why didn't we?                  

533
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,500
                     Because you
                    were so busy

534
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,200
             making those stupid
                 telethon jokes.

535
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
        Oh.                     

536
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,500
Yeah, I'm gonna                 
miss those.                     

537
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
    All right, listen.          

538
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,100
        Here's her check        
        and here's mine.        

539
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
      That makes $30,000.       

540
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,800
Well, thank you                 
very much.                      

541
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Enjoy your pool room.           

542
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,700
Oh, and you should              

543
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
rest well in the knowledge      

544
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,900
that this $30,000 will pay      
  nicely for that screen test.  

545
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
    Good news, girls!           

546
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,900
We're going to Hollywood!       

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
             BOTH:              
              Eww!
