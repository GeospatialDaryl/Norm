00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,777
Hey, Sack-Happy,                
how you doing?                  

3
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:12,979
                  Hey, there,   
                  Rubber Thumbs.

00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,214
Hey, I thought                  
you'd be                        

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,248
          on a dim route by now.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,482
I don't see you pushing         

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,484
many number one sacks           
there, Clavin.                  

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,153
         What the heck          
    are they talking about?     

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,055
It's kind of a postal rap.      

10
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,660
             Hey, there's a flap
             that you had a     
             brush with utility.

11
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:27,928
Ah, 604 is all the way.         

12
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,897
            Yeah, well, you     
            know the scheme fin.

13
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,364
    Yeah.                       

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,433
    You know, I actually once   
    thought of asking Cliff     

15
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,502
          what it all meant, but
          then it occurred to me

16
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,737
            he might tell me.

 Takes everything you've got   

20
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,368
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

21
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:54,871
 Sure would help a lot         

22
00:00:54,905 --> 00:01:00,644
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

23
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:02,528
   Sometimes you want to go    

24
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:08,068
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

25
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:12,539
 And they're always glad       
        you came               

26
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,109
         You want to be        
      where you can see        

27
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,811

    are all the same

 You want to be where everybody
    knows your name            

29
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,518
         You want to go        
      where people know        

30
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,188
   People are all the same     

31

      You want to go where

another minute.                 

34
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,599
      What's up, Frasier?       

35
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,184
I'm a man in a predicament, Sam.

36
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,584
    I've got to find a gift     

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,021
for the dearest, sweetest,      
 most wonderful woman on Earth. 

38
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,040
             So, you finally    
             dumped Lilith, huh?

39
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:04,374
    No.                         

40
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:05,842
It's our one-month anniversary, 

41
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,044
      and I'm just stumped      
     about what to get her.     

42
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,579
        Any suggestions?        

43
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:12,098
    Well, you could get her     
         a nice "mank."         

44
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,584
        "Mank"?                 

45
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:15,969
        Yeah. You know,         
    it's a mock mink.           

46
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,521
             I got one for Vera.

47
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,240
    You cannot tell it          
      from the real thing.      

48
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:21,475
          It's great.           

49
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,776
  Unless, of course, it rains,  

50
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,444
        and then you just       
        toss it in the dryer,   

51
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,930
    and you leave the house     
      for a couple hours.       

52
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,067
        Well, I suppose         
    I'll think of something.    

53
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:31,334
         Wish me luck.          

54
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,954
        Hey, Cliff, new suit?   

55
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,288
    Oh, well, no, actually,     

56
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,891
I just had it dry cleaned       
          there, Doc.           

57
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,092
        Uh, hey, Woody.         

58
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,145
a beer, and uh, one for         
 <i>mi compadre</i> here, Normie.      

59
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:46,483
              Are you all right?

60
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,985
     Yeah, no, it's just...     

61
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,404
      Sorry. I thought Cliff was
      going to buy me a beer.   

62
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:58,211
Well, uh, well, I am.           

63
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,349
        Hey, hey, Norm,         
    Norm, no, come on, now,     

64
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,816
knock it off there,             
will you?                       

65
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,619
Geez. It's just that my annual  
civil service raise             

66
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,622
came in today, you know,        
at three and a half percent,    

67
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,458
just like clockwork,            
you know, as if, uh,            

68
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,128
carrying that bag               
wasn't honor enough.            

69
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,580
Wow, Mr. Clavin,                
you got a raise, huh?           
        Yup.                    

70
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,265
        I've been hoping        
 for a raise for two years now. 

71
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,433
    I haven't gotten diddly.    

72
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,369
Well, Woody,                    
that is an outrage.             

73
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,836
You ought to walk               
right up to Miss Howe,          

74
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,606
look her square in the eye,     
and demand diddly.              

75

00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,842
    Ah, tell you what,          
    you work overtime,          

77
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,577
you get over-diddly, pal.

And, uh, diddly-                
and-a-half on weekends,         

80
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,834

on holidays, too.               

81
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,068
             Uh, Cliff, Cliff...

82
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,288
        The secret              
    is knowing when to stop.    

83
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:43,757
        Hey, uh, Sam?           
    Yeah?                       

84
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,825
          Do you think Miss Howe

85
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,860
        would give me a raise   
        if I asked her?         

86
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,496
Well, let's see, uh,            
you're a good bartender,        

87
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,315
you've never had a vacation,    
you never been out sick.        

88
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,250
    Probably not.               

89
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,970
        Aw, gee, really, Sam?   
Oh, she's tough.                

90
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,838
Maybe if you get her            
in a good mood.                 

91
00:03:58,873 --> 00:03:59,956
        Uh, how do I do that?   

92
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,541
Well, put her in a good mood,   
you know?                       

93
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,076
Be nice to her;                 
compliment her.                 

94
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,378
            Compliment-- right. 
    Yeah.                       

95
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,696
        Okay, thanks, Sam.      
Mm-hmm.                         

96
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,998
          I'll do it.           

97
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:10,333
 Uh, what should I compliment?  

98
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,135
         I don't know;          
  first thing you see, Woody.   

99
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:14,804
                        REBECCA:
                        Come in.

100
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,940
Miss Howe,                      
did I ever tell you             

101
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:19,659
you have a nice...?             

102
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,330
        uh, smile?              

103
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,199
            Thank you, Woody.   

104
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,517
          ( <i>softly</i> ):           
             Yeah.              

105
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,052
Was there something you wanted? 

106
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,720
Well, uh, Miss Howe,            

107
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:34,591
I've been here at Cheers        
for quite a while now.          

108
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,259
I'm a good worker,              

109
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:38,211
    I don't take vacations,     
        I'm never sick,         

110
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:40,013
 and I was just wondering if... 

111
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,381
  No, Woody, Woody, I'm going   
to have to stop you right there.

112
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,117
I cannot give you a title.      

113
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,385
            "Title"?            

114
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,370
  Yes, I know you deserve it,   
      but the front office      

115
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,305
      just doesn't let me       
     hand those things out.     

116
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,157
         No, Miss Howe,         
     you don't understand.      

117
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,260
You know, sometimes people      
    work here ten, 15 years     

118
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,360
before receiving a title.       

119
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,495
     How can I justify...?      

120
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,297
Miss Howe, I want a raise.      

121
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,065
        Oh, is that all?        

122
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,017
                    That's fine.

123
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,136
        How much do you want?   

124
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,337
Just like that?                 
                Well, of course.

125
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,339
      I thought you came in here
      to beat me out of a title,

126
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,340
            but if you just want

127
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,308
      to settle for money,      
    well, that's fine.          

128
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,560
         Wait a minute.         

129
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:12,362
        Let's just stick        
     with this title thing.     

130
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,399
    No, no, Woody, you said     
 you would settle for a raise.  

131
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,501
         Now, I'm going         
    to hold you to it.          

132
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,785
    Oh, no, I blew it!          

133
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,107
     I should have demanded     
            a title.            

134
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,844
    Money gets spent,           
    but titles are forever.     

135
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,062
    No, Woody, I told you...    

136
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,313
     Doggone it, Miss Howe,     

137
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:33,399
you're not going                
to palm some raise off on me.   

138
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,734
      I don't want money.       

139
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,236
      I-I deserve a title.      

140
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,807
Woody, I've met some tough      
negotiators in my life...       

141
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,493
All right, you deserve it.      

142
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:45,095
  I'll go to the mat for you.   

143
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,362
                Congratulations.

144
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:49,232
            You're the new      
            Senior Bartender.   

145
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,569
Get out! Senior Bartender?!     

146
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,854
Wait till I tell my folks!      

147
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,055
To think I came in here         

148
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,891
asking for                      
a stupid little raise,          

149
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,158
and now this.                   

150
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,860
          I just hope           
it doesn't go to my head.       

151
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,696
    Oh... that's what's nice    
    about you, Woody.           

152
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,132
Nothing ever goes to your head. 

153
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,105
              Hey.              

154
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,924
So, did you get                 
the raise?                      

155
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,862
      Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,      
         Sammy, Sammy.          

156
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,297
                There's more to 
                life than money.

157
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,166
Oh, no,                         
you didn't get the raise.       

158
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:24,835
                 I got something
                 much better.   

159
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:28,004
    You're looking at Cheers'   
    new Senior Bartender.       

160
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,123
Oh, Woody, you didn't fall      
for that, did you?              

161
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,141
                  Fall for what?

162
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,459
Oh, man, she conned you.        

163
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,294
She talked you                  
into accepting a title          

164
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,295
instead of a raise.             

165
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,329
I don't believe you.            

166
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,030
              Hey, I'd like to  
              see you do better.

167
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,031
         ( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
             Hey...             

168
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,550
she may be able                 
to pull the wool                

169
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:41,951
over your eyes,                 
but not mine.                   

170
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:42,952
As a matter of fact,            

171
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,237
I'll prove it to you.           

172
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,739
You know, I'm due for a raise   
around here.                    

173
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,141
    Behold the master here.     

174
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,476
     Woody, watch the bar.      

175
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,777
Sam.                            
        Mm-hmm.                 

176
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,195
Considering my new title,       

177
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,197
I don't think you can just      
give me orders like that.       

178
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:55,282
         You're right.          

179
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,117
    Please forgive me.          

180
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,953
    Um, I respectfully          
    request permission          

181
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:04,291
        to ask you              
     to watch the bar, sir.     

182
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,626
Money can't buy                 
that kind of respect.           

183
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,180
I was wondering...              

184
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,064
            The answer is no.   

185
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,801
  Oh, come on, a little raise   
is not going to kill you.       

186
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,068
    No, a little raise          

187
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,304
                    is not going
                    to kill me. 

188
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,239
            And neither are     
            those little free   
            rounds of drinks    

189
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,373
                we're always    
                giving everyone.

190
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,441
          Or the little bar tabs

191
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,376
             all our friends are
             always running up. 

192
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:26,196
 But you add them all together, 
and they spell bankruptcy.      

193
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,231
    Which is probably           
     more than you can do.      

194
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,499
Wait a minute.                  

195
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,168
What do you mean                
"bankruptcy"?                   

196
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,170
    We're losing money, Sam.    

197
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,522
          And as long as we are,

198
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,624
no one's getting a raise.       
            Nothing.            

199
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,925
     All right, all right.      

200
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,211
But if you want to go out there 

201
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,879
         and save face          
in front of your friends,       

202
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:46,632
     I can give you a title     
     just like I did Woody.     

203
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,684
         Oh... come on.         

204
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,754
    A-a title to save face?     

205
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:52,822
How childish do you think I am? 

206
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,859
          Senior Bartender, huh?

207
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,528
            Well, Wood, you     
            know, I'd say a, uh,

208
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,729
little promotion like that      

209
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:02,365
    kind of deserves a round    
    of drinks on the house.     

210
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,333
     Aw, gee, Mr. Peterson,     
          I'd love to,          

211
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:08,237
and I-I'm real sorry, but gosh, 
I-I just don't think I'd better.

212
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:11,040
  Boy, you give a guy a title,  
    he turns into a fascist.    

213
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,328
So, Wood, now that you scratched
      and clawed your way       

214
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,763
 to the top of your profession, 

215
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,748
      are you still going       
  to talk to us little people?  

216
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:20,533
"Little people"?                

217
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,886
         Oh, right, uh,         
      you folks don't like      

218
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,021
 to be called midgets anymore.  

219
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,108
    Sure, I'll talk to you.     

220
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,896
     It won't be easy with      
 your tongue in another state.  

221
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,067
 So, Sam, how much did you get? 

222
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,136
Well, it's kind of complicated, 
             Woody.             

223
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,939
 It's all tied up with bonuses  
    and stock options.          

224
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:44,273
                    But I can   

225
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,776
         tell you that,         
     uh, you're looking at      

226
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:49,913
    the new Executive           
     Supervising Bartender.     

227
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,582
          NORM:                 
          Well, congratulations,
          Sammy.                

228
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,918
             You know, I'd say a
             promotion like that

229
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:55,835
        kind of deserves a round
        of drinks on the house. 

230
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,154
Nice try, man.                  
                Well, you know. 

231
00:08:58,188 --> 00:08:59,989
You just couldn't stand it, Sam,
        could you?              

232
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:01,590
    That I had a title          
        and you didn't.         

233
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,892
    Oh, come on, Woody.         

234
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:05,394
    These titles                
    don't mean anything.        

235
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,313
      You want to switch?       

236
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:08,180
    Right. Senior Bartender.    

237
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,433
    Like I've been dying        
    for that one all my life.   

238
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:13,819
Hey, at least mine's            
a real great title              

239
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,755
and not a stupid                
made-up one like yours.         

240
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,889
    Hey, mine is not made up.   

241
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,890
     Hey, hey, all right,       
     all right, all right,      

242
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,192
knock it off, all right?!       

243
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,893
Will the Senior Idiot Bartender 

244
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,296
    and the Executive           
    Supervising Moron           

245
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,631
        shut their yaps         
     for about ten seconds?     

246
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,933
    You're bartenders.          

247
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,634
        That's it.              

248
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,304
    You're a bartender          
and you're a bartender, period.

I've got a problem.

00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,549
        It says,                
        we got a live one.      

369
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,185
         I don't know.          

370
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,486
    I kind of like it.          

371
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,922
Looks like a couple of dogs     
getting real familiar.          

372
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,024
                        Oh, wow.
              CARLA:            
              Yeah.             

373
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,426
                Oh, yeah,       
                it sure does.   

374
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,827
    Somebody,                   
    hose 'em down.              

375
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,047
I should have known better      
than to show you Philistines    

376
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,749
      a fine work of art.       

377
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:55,868
            Rebecca?            

378
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,653
Yes. Uh, do you mind            
if I keep this                  

379
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:59,322
in your office                  
for a few days?                 

380
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:00,689
    It's my anniversary gift    
        to Lilith.              

381
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:03,025
                      Certainly.

382
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,228
                I hope she loves
                you very much.  

383
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,108
Woody, aren't you               
finished numbering              

384
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,376
those Ping-Pong balls yet?      

385
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:23,279
    Almost. I'm just putting    
 happy faces on all the zeros.  

386
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,681
              There's a shocker.

387
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,133
            Boy, I can't        
            believe this.       

388
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:30,003
            This place has      
            been packed for     
            two weeks now.      

389
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,871
This contest was a great idea.  

390
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,272
I don't know.                   
I kind of like                  

391
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,723
              the way it used   
              to be around here.

392
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,458
Yeah, know                      
what you mean, Normy.           

393
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,826
                  All these damn
                  people here   

394
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:40,363
             treating us like   
             some kind of public
             gathering place.   

395
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:45,084
I think this little raffle idea 
of mine turned out pretty well, 

396
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,452
don't you?                      

397
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,421
Don't you think you ought       
to give me a little thank you?  

398
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,656
A little pat on the back?       

399
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,691
Or you on your back?            

400
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,561
        Oh, Sam, when you       
        say things like that,   

401
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,896
                you make me love
                you even more.  

402
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,065
You're being sarcastic, right?  

403
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,251
            Are you?            

404
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,920
         Oh, Dr. Crane,         
     I'm glad you're here.      

405
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:07,073
            I hate to mention   
            this, but you've    
            had that picture    

406
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,575
              of the two dogs   
              in my office for  
              quite a while now.

407
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,976
             When are you giving
             that to Lilith?    

408
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,445
I'm going to give it            
to her tonight.                 

409
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,846
And by the way,                 

410
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,949
they are not-- and I can't      
  say this more emphatically--  

411
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:16,983
        two dogs.               

412
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,718
Whatever. I want them out       

413
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,886
                of my office.   

414
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,054
                    They keep   
                    reminding me

415
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,355
                 of how lousy my
                 social life is.

416
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,875
Yeah, but to be                 
honest with ya,                 

417
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,410
I wouldn't mind winning         
that Caribbean cruise prize.    

418
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,679
                Yeah, call me   

419
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,764
Ishmael, but, uh...             

420
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,700
Well, the Clavin men, uh,       
all go down to the sea.         

421
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,903
I guess I must have salt water  
in my veins.                    

422
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,072
            Too bad             
there isn't an air bubble.      

423
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,860
LILITH:                         
Frasier?                        

424
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,195
Oh, why there she is now,       

425
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,998
      the ray of sunshine       
I call my blushing bride.       

426
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,400
Dear, that color jacket         
is not good on you.             

427
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:52,734
                    Yeah.       

428
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:53,986
                 Sorry, fellas, 
                 she's all mine.

429
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,021
             You can't have her.

430
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,839
    ( <i>Frasier laughs</i> )          

431
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,043
          Well, anyway, Happy   
          Anniversary, my sweet.

432
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,211
Same to you.                    

433
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,678
Are you ready for dinner?       

434
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,714
            Yes. Oh, just first,
            I've got a little   
            surprise for you.   

435
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:06,049
            Now close your eyes.

436
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,851
Oh, Frasier, love, I'm really   
not a proponent of surprises.   

437
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,519
My father once asked me         
to close my eyes,               

438
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,555
and he left for two years.      

439
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,840
                Well, then, keep
                your eyes open. 

440
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,409
                Uh, by the way, 
                are you familiar

441
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,777
        with the artist Tidwell?

442
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,078
Of course.                      

443
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,679
Isn't he the one                
who did the painting            

444
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,815
of the two dogs commingling,    
then sold it                    

445
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,084
for an ungodly amount           
of money to some ninny?         

446
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,622
        Yes, that's him.        

447
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,723
Well, what's my surprise?       

448
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,441
                Oh, surprise.   

449
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,543
                Well, it's      
                nothing, really.

450
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,378
            It's no big deal.   
            ( <i>laughs</i> )          

451
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,848
          It's just, um, my car.

452
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:43,253
Why, Frasier,                   
I'm overwhelmed.                

453
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,021
Your Mercedes?                  

454
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,122
            You know, nothing   
            says loving         

455
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,423
                 like something 
                 from Stuttgart.

456
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,225
                    Shall we?   

457
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,227
But what does this have         
to do with Tidwell?             

458
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,661
              Oh, well, that's  
              his name, you see.

459
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,730
                  I give all my 
                  possessions,  
                  uh, pet names.

460
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,665
              Well, by the way, 
              my, uh, cufflinks,

461
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,300
Bert and Ernie.                 

462
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,202
                      WOODY:    
                      Attention.

463
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:01,337
      Attention, everyone.      

464
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:02,655
                Now's the moment

465
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,457
  we've all been waiting for.   

466
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,392
                I hope you're as
                excited as I am,

467
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,694
            because this is     
            probably the most   
            exciting event      

468
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,796
              I've ever been to 
              in my entire life.

469
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,148
                  Well, e-except
                  for the time  

470
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,750
             that our prize cow 
             Velveeta gave birth

471
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,153
        to a two-headed calf.   

472
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:18,804
                Now I don't     
                know how many   
                of you have seen

473
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,539
                  a two-headed  
                  calf get born,
                  but the ones  

474
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,874
                who have will   
                bear me out.    

475
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,042
         Woody, Woody.          

476
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,309
                 Actually, it's 
                 not as exciting

477
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,477
             as you might think.

478
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,346
            Only one of the     
            heads could move.   
        Woody.                  

479
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,999
        The other one just      
        seemed kind of dazed.   

480
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,335
        Hey, Woody, pick        
the damn number, will you then? 

481
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,770
                 Oh, okay, okay.
