1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,912
BAR BET

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,748
- Chekhov.
- No, Norm, it was lbsen.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,798
lt was Chekhov
lt was ''The Cherry Orchard.''

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,032
You're full of it.
lt was lbsen, ''The Master Builder.''

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,589
- lt was Chekhov.
- lbsen, lbsen, lbsen.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,796
- Chekhov, Chekhov...
- lbsen!

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,315
Excuse me. l don't mean to stop you,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,155
but you are talking about Anton Chekhov
and Henrik lbsen?

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,472
Of course we're talking about
Anton Chekhov and Henrik lbsen.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,350
This is wonderful!
Perhaps l might be of some assistance.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,195
l would love to contribute
to your literary enquiry.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,954
- l suppose she can help?
- Please, please.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,078
- lf anybody can, you can.
- l'd like to think so.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,118
OK, what were you watching
on TV that night

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,671
when Norm gorged on cheese doodles
and whistled ''The Way We Were''?

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,428
lbsen. And it was taco chips.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,154
- Pay up. Let's go.
- All right.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,073
l guess it was
Chekhov and cheese doodles

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,152
the night Artie tried
to comb his hair with his feet.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,279
Yeah, you're on thin ice
arguing the classics with me.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,353
- Hey, Sammy, long time.
- How have you been?

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,114
- About the same. You?
- l never change.

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,111
- What'll you have?
- My usual.

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,635
You still drinking that stuff?

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,679
- Who is that guy?
- l don't know. He's your friend.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,796
l don't know him. You guys?

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,794
He's never been here before.
l'm very good at placing faces.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,430
Yeah? Then place yours
where we can't see it.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,830
- l wish Coach were here, he'd know.
- Where is he?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,915
He went to get his driver's licence
renewed, he'll be back next week.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,673
- Why so long?
- He went to Vermont.

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,831
He heard the test was easier there.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,753
Why don't you just ask him his name?

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,071
Better a minute of embarrassment
than look a fool.

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,516
No, it'd be too easy. l can handle this.

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,514
You know how good l am
at thinking on my feet.

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,911
l've seen you add and subtract on them.

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,312
- Subtraction must kinda hurt?
- Watch and learn.

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,871
lnstead of your usual,
l thought you might like a Manhattan.

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,237
- Manhattan is my usual.
- Gotcha!

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,796
- How's work?
- Fine.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,509
You still work in the same place?
lt had a real funny name...

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,231
- My house.
- Right! l still get a kick out of that.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,473
l'm still working the same crummy job,
stuffing envelopes,

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,596
but l'm glad you find that funny.

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,915
l didn't mean funny in the humorous
sense. l meant funny more in the...

47
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,036
Who the hell are you?

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,988
- l'm Eddie Gordon.
- Eddie... Eddie Gordon?

49
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,276
l don't know who he is.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,035
A year ago, you bet me your bar
you could marry Jacqueline Bisset

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,194
- by midnight tomorrow.
- Come on, who the hell would...

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,351
Oh, Eddie Gordon.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,796
Jeez, how the hell are you, Eddie?

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,793
- ls it coming back to you, Sam?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,111
l'm a little hazy,
l had a few too many that night.

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,513
- You had a lot too many that night.
- l was going through a rough period.

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,313
How are you and Jackie getting along?
You didn't invite me to the wedding.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,750
l must have been drinking tequila.

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,993
l always want Jacqueline Bisset
when l drink tequila.

60
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,631
But l bet you don't always write it down,
signing your name in front of witnesses.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,792
- l did that, too?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,190
Keep it, it's a copy.

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,590
Listen, this was obviously
a joke, Eddie.

64
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,036
l'm no expert,
but l know a little bit about the law

65
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,158
and this sounds like a crock.
You'll never own this bar.

66
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,108
When l take over, l'm thinking
of serving free chicken wings.

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,748
Sorry, Sam, the law's the law.

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,512
What do you say to those
little meatballs, get a Sterno flame...

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,712
- Eddie, as a drinking partner, you stink!
- l'm sorry you feel that way, Sam.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,998
l'll see you tomorrow at midnight,
when the bar becomes mine.

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,436
You've thought about serving crab puffs?

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,875
Melvilles does them in mustard sauce.

73
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,953
lf you're serious about this,
you don't have a leg to stand on.

74
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,076
Most snakes don't.

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,553
We'll find out in court. My attorney's
looked it over, he says we've got a shot.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,840
Don't get upset, you'll still have your job.
l'm going to need a bartender.

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,597
You actually went out drinking
with that man?

78
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,672
That's not the worst. l picked up the bill.

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,589
- This has to be a joke, doesn't it?
- Let an attorney take a look at that.

80
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,438
You know of one, or did you finally pass
your bar exam using the pity clause?

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,479
When l pass my bar exam, Cliff,
you're going to eat your words.

82
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,359
Yeah, if l got any teeth left.

83
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,513
What do you think,
Mr Witless for the prosecution?

84
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,073
lt seems you signed an agreement with
Eddie which may or may not be binding.

85
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,870
Tom, knock off the legalese. Talk to us
in a language we can understand.

86
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,113
Trust me, Sam, this thing won't hold up.
You were drunk, right?

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,319
lt's not a contract, it's a wager.
You'll win this case easy.

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,074
Tom's right. Let Eddie press his case.

89
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,596
We'll get a good lawyer
and make a monkey out of him.

90
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,797
- Oh, boy, oh...
- What? What's wrong?

91
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,350
lf you don't trust Tom,
get a second opinion.

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,751
No, it's not that.
l can't let Eddie take me to court.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,512
Why?

94
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,437
l'd have to testify that l was drunk
and made an idiot out of myself.

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,556
You're worried about the publicity?

96
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,475
The press wasn't exactly kind to me
when l drank myself out of baseball.

97
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,269
l'd almost rather lose the bar
than be humiliated again.

98
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,670
Oh, Sam.

99
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,308
Quit acting human, it confuses me.

100
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,952
l don't suppose you could marry her?

101
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,069
Yeah. Find, meet, woo
Jacqueline Bisset in two days?

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,435
lt'd take at least a week.

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,594
- You kidding? Five working days, tops.
- Wait, l've got an idea.

104
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,719
You've actually conceived
something besides a child?

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,838
A bitter and unprovoked attack.

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,594
- l like it.
- What have you got?

107
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,069
Sam, this doesn't say anything

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,630
about having to marry
Jacqueline Bisset, the movie actress.

109
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,792
There's got to be more than one
Jacqueline Bisset.

110
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,633
Marry one, win the bet
and get a quick divorce.

111
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,075
Eddie won't be able to say a thing.

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,394
All l have to do is find another
Jacqueline Bisset and marry her?

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,949
- lt can't be that simple.
- Sam...

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,839
Hush, hush, l'm thinking.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,913
Someone note the date and the time.

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,436
We've got to call information
all over the country.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,830
l think l can help you out there.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,595
l have the phone books
of every major city in the country.

119
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,070
- Why?
- l just collect phone book cover art.

120
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,196
One of those.

121
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,797
This'll be fun.
We'll find anybody called Bisset,

122
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,714
ask if they have a relative named
Jacqueline and get them to come here.

123
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,950
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

124
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,828
- So much for the Sun Belt.
- Norm!

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,595
You Philistine, you just put a fold
in ''Sunrise Over Albuquerque''.

126
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,432
Hey, boys...

127
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,116
l'd expect there'd be a few Jacqueline
Bissets. lt can't be that uncommon.

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,555
l got a Jacqueline Bisset on the phone.

129
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,757
- Paydirt!
- She sounds sweet, but there's a catch.

130
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,629
She's 93,
she lives in a rest home in Maine.

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,234
- So is she married?
- l didn't ask.

132
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,356
Are you married?

133
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,193
Got a 94-year-old husband,
been married 73 years.

134
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,351
Happy years?

135
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,795
l just talked to a man
in Green Bank, West Virginia,

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,158
with a grand-daughter named Jacqueline
Bisset, 25-years-old and unmarried.

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,390
- Let me talk to her.
- l already did.

138
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,279
Jackie will be here tomorrow morning.

139
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,671
- How did you do it?
- A little ingenuity.

140
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,150
l told her she'd won a trip to Boston
in a radio game show.

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,313
- Just convince her to marry you.
- l could kiss you.

142
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,156
Yeah, you can. But l warn you,
you're not going to get anywhere.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,435
- l offered prizes to induce her to come.
- That's OK, like what?

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,909
Free round-trip air fare, first class,

145
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,039
suite at the Ritz, free historical tour,
matched set of luggage.

146
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,795
- Why not offer her a car?
- l did, but she took the cash instead.

147
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,758
Only kidding, Sammy.
The point is, she'll be here.

148
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,391
You're right, you're right.
My problems are over.

149
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,032
Aren't you forgetting one important step?
You still have to get her to marry you.

150
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,354
lt's no problem. As soon as l get her
face-to-face, she'll fall under my spell.

151
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,071
- You killer.
- Sam, your vanity knows no bounds.

152
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,431
l guess l ought to wear my best outfit.

153
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,956
Diane, when you dream of me,
what am l wearing?

154
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,076
An ant hill.

155
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,710
Congratulations, Coach. All the weeks of
cramming and drilling with your friends,

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,474
it's all paid off.
We're proud of you.

157
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,676
All right. Take care.

158
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,753
- Coach passed his driver's test?
- No, he found Vermont.

159
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,399
- When's your ex-wife-to-be to be here?
- She's supposed to be here now.

160
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,835
Cliff was meant to pick her up
two hours ago.

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,833
- Are you ready?
- l don't know. What do you think?

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,878
Yes! Any girl would jump
at the chance to marry you.

163
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,032
Sam, there is one problem, however.

164
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,352
l believe l detect a hint of fresh air
coming through your cologne.

165
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,159
You're kidding.

166
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,791
l must have missed a couple
of important pulse points. Thank you.

167
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,596
This is ''Cheers'', Miss Bisset.
That's Sam Malone.

168
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,469
Well, he is good-looking.

169
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,712
The bad news is he talks.

170
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,193
- Miss Bisset, Sam Malone.
- Oh, boy, thank you for coming.

171
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,399
Cliff, set those bags down here.
Come and sit down by the bar.

172
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,269
Listen, did Cliff explain
why we need you?

173
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,671
Yes, he did,
and l'm not marrying anybody

174
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,435
except in the usual way,
where the groom isn't a total stranger.

175
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,513
l understand that,
but this isn't like a real marriage.

176
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,708
lt's just for a few hours, until l win a bet,
then we'll get it annulled tomorrow.

177
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,713
Why not consider it a warm-up
for the real thing?

178
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,759
l'm sorry, l'm just not interested.

179
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,550
l almost didn't make this trip when
l thought it was a legitimate contest.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,909
But l said to myself, ''Jackie Bisset,
nothing like this will happen again.''

181
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,598
So l kissed my dog, Smiley, and waved
goodbye to my pa, and here l am.

182
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,356
Knock it off!

183
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,636
You don't talk like that.

184
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,557
Listen, l know this whole thing's been
handled in a very stupid way.

185
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,836
But l really am in a jam here.

186
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,633
l tell you what,
we promised you a guided tour,

187
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,590
why don't l show you the sights,
and l'll explain my whole story.

188
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,356
l know where to start, City Hall. lt's
historic and we'll get a marriage licence.

189
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,035
- l really don't think so, no.
- Come on.

190
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,478
Why not? You have a chance to help
one of the greatest guys in the world.

191
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,110
- l barely know him.
- Let me fill you in.

192
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,273
Anybody here would do anything
for this guy. Right?

193
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,192
That's right.

194
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,117
Look, look.
Just hear him out, please, all right?

195
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,239
l never have been to Boston.
l always wanted to see it.

196
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,396
l tell you what, you tell me your story
and l'll think about it.

197
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,872
You got a deal. You'll love this,
the Sam Malone pre-nuptial tour.

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,271
We'll start of with the USS Constitution,

199
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,512
then we'll go to the Old North Church,
Paul Revere's house,

200
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,231
and then we'll top it off
with the traditional Boston blood test.

201
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,872
- All those places are in Boston?
- Yes, Norman.

202
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,874
This town is a treasure-trove
of historical monuments.

203
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,996
That's really something.

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,311
Thousands of people flock to Boston
to see all those sights,

205
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,789
and soak up a lot of American heritage,

206
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,396
and l sit here in a bar,
night after night, guzzling beer.

207
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,479
- lt's sad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

208
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,870
But, hey, no one's forcing them.

209
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,792
lt's getting late.

210
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,997
Sammy must be having a hard time
talking Jackie into it.

211
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,870
Yes, and if he doesn't get back
in a year, his cologne will wear off.

212
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,349
l don't know why he's going
to this trouble.

213
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,988
l discussed this case
with my law professor.

214
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,675
Was that before he scratched himself
and ate a banana?

215
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,990
Are you calling him an ape?

216
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,633
You know something, one of these days
l'm going to... l don't know what.

217
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,270
That man would be magnificent
in front of a jury.

218
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,719
Sam, thank you so much. That was
the most fun day of my whole life.

219
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,236
l'm glad you enjoyed it.
Sit down, l'll make you a cup of tea.

220
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,392
Boston is such a lovely city.

221
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,473
When we were on the Constitution,
somebody recognised Sam.

222
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,313
l didn't know he was a celebrity.

223
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,110
Cut the chit chat. ls Mammy Yokum
going to marry you or not?

224
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,799
Well, she hasn't decided.

225
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,669
- What do you say, Jackie?
- l don't know.

226
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,439
Sam, l always thought my wedding day
would be beautiful and special.

227
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,036
lt will be. We'll get a minister
and have it right here.

228
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,634
You think that's beautiful and special?

229
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,234
Maybe you're asking the wrong guy.

230
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,428
lt's quarter to twelve,
l don't have much time.

231
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,195
Either you say yes now
or l'll have to think of something else.

232
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,113
And he's already thought once today.

233
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,196
- This is all happening so fast.
- Fast? lt's been eight hours.

234
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,558
By the time l knew my ex-husband
that long, he'd already cheated on me.

235
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,118
Well...

236
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,478
l was always raised to believe
you should help people when you can.

237
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,955
l'm getting married!

238
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,753
Do you mind if l call home first?
l'd like to tell my pa about it.

239
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,990
Sure, come into my office here.

240
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,118
And don't forget to tell Billy-Joe-Bob-Jim.

241
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,596
Don't take too long,
we don't have much time. Oh, boy.

242
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,673
- Sam, l have dire news.
- Good or bad?

243
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,514
That was Justice Fiedler's secretary.
He's running a little late.

244
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,195
- What has he got to do?
- Well, his wife is having a baby.

245
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,830
So? His work was finished
a long time ago.

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,312
l'm sorry, but what do l do now? We
don't have time to call someone else.

247
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,598
lt's not as though we have Justices
of the Peace and ministers in here.

248
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,751
Don't be too sure, my son.

249
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,555
- You, Norman?
- Yeah.

250
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,078
ln the '50s l sent a dollar to a church
advertising in ''Rolling Stone''.

251
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,635
l'm an official minister
of the Church of the Living Desert.

252
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,599
- Did you want to get out of the draft?
- No, we were just goofing around.

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,595
We were at the accounting club, getting
high smelling adding machine ribbons.

254
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,796
lt seemed funny, l don't know.

255
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,999
ln that mindless state
even this business used to seem funny.

256
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,759
- lt reminded me of something else.
- Hello.

257
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,229
Oh, Justice Fiedler!

258
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,791
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Sorry l'm late, l just became a father.

259
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,114
We're all thrilled now get your buns
over here. We only have a few minutes.

260
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,113
- Carla, stay out of this.
- Here's your pulpit.

261
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,714
We are in a hurry.
Could you do this quickly?

262
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,637
Yes, l see there's a certain urgency.
By the way, it's a boy. Nine pounds!

263
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,519
Just what the world needed.

264
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,752
- Hello, everybody.
- You're just in time, Eddie,

265
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,480
for my wedding to Jacqueline Bisset.

266
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,313
- Don't make me laugh.
- Come here.

267
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,597
- See her, the girl on the phone?
- Wow, Jacqueline Bisset.

268
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,910
What happened to her?

269
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,913
lt's not the movie star, Eddie.

270
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,312
The bet was Jacqueline Bisset and
that's her name. She's got lD to prove it.

271
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,756
- What is this, a trick?
- No, he's winning the bet.

272
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,276
Why don't you call Sam the winner
and forget the whole thing?

273
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,795
- You're going to marry her?
- You bet.

274
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,353
- This is JP Fiedler.
- Yes, and father of the miracle baby.

275
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,715
Give it a rest, will you?

276
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,190
l don't know if it's necessary
for you to go to all this trouble.

277
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,512
- Are you calling the bet off?
- No, he has an arrangement in mind.

278
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,797
That's right.
Maybe we can work out a settlement.

279
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,350
- That's what you've been after all along.
- Quiet, blondie!

280
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,431
Yeah.

281
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,672
This is between us men of the world.

282
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,231
l'll consider dropping the whole matter
for maybe...five grand.

283
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,034
- You'll get nothing from me, Eddie.
- All right, Sam.

284
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,591
l'll consider it square if you give me
and a date free drinks for life.

285
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,512
- No.
- Do it, Sam.

286
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,309
l'd like to see
what would go out with him.

287
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,392
Besides me, l mean.

288
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,358
Well, he kinda grows on you.

289
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,353
- Free drinks for the rest of the year?
- No.

290
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,988
One on the house?

291
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,277
- Not a chance.
- Gee, come on, Sam.

292
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,716
How about one of those olives
with the pimento in?

293
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,399
You think about this the next time
you shoot your mouth off in some bar.

294
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,599
Drinks on the house!

295
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,514
You see, l always land on my feet.

296
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,148
Sometimes on somebody else's.

297
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,198
You've thought about
what you've done to that girl?

298
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,909
- Which one?
- Jackie.

299
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,277
That's right,
she still thinks we're getting married.

300
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,879
- She didn't want to do it anyway.
- Did you see the look on her face?

301
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,191
She's a simple girl
from a rural environment

302
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,318
who finds herself in the city
being entertained by a...

303
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,156
...slightly attractive semi-celebrity.
How could her head not be turned?

304
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,869
Yeah, maybe you're right.
You think l laid on the charm too thick?

305
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,431
Yes, but she's a farm girl, she's
used to stepping around such things.

306
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,989
Sam, guess what?
l told my pa all about this,

307
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,756
and he's a baseball fan
and he remembers you, sort of.

308
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,559
That was the kind of player l was.

309
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,234
- lsn't that great?
- Yeah.

310
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,518
- Yeah! Boy, this will be sticky.
- What are we waiting for?

311
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,879
You know... Will you do this?
You're a little smarter than me.

312
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,474
l'm a lot smarter than you are.

313
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,279
This paper napkin is a little smarter.

314
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,954
- Jackie, there'll be no wedding today.
- What about the bet?

315
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,157
The bet was called off.
Sam gets to keep his bar.

316
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,108
- Oh... Well, that's good.
- Yes.

317
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,193
Let's be honest.
Weren't you falling for Sam just a little?

318
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,559
- Sam? No!
- Come on, he's a very attractive man.

319
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,032
Almost as attractive as he thinks he is.

320
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,638
He only stopped complementing himself
once, to ask if l wanted to.

321
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,873
- l like you.
- l like you, too, Diane.

322
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,952
Say, you must see the girls
Sam goes out with.

323
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,749
What sort of girl would fall for Sam?

324
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,996
Pathetic wretches.

325
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,277
lt would have to be someone
lacking in self-respect,

326
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,079
as shallow as he is
and as empty-headed.

327
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,753
Amen.

328
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,277
ls Diane making you feel
a little bit better about what happened?

329
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,591
- Yes, she is.
- Good. She'd be the one to understand.

330
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,796
You know, this little filly and l...

331
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,512
- More tea?
- Thank you.
