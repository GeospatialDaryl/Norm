1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:04,051
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,020
Hey, Sam. Sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,022
Had to stop at the drug store.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,974
That's okay, Woody.
Yep.

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,045
Had to make another embarrassing
trip to the drug store

6
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:15,613
to get a little, uh...

7
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,982
Protection?
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,852
You know, Kelly and I want
to have a family and all,

9
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:23,555
but we figured we'd
wait until after that raise you promised.

10
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,358
Hope you got a lot
of protection.

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,543
Well, as usual, you know,
I'm a little embarrassed

12
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,212
and nervous when I go in there,

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,214
so I buy a whole bunch of stuff

14
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,249
so it doesn't look
like I'm just trying

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,783
to get some... you know.

16
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:36,952
Protection.

17
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:40,455
Yeah. So I got some
paper plates...

18
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,924
batteries, flashbulbs,

19
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,327
Skol...

20
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,996
some gum...

21
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:51,833
Chia Pet...

22
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,969
oh, eyeglass repair kit...

23
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,171
Yeah.

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,606
Oh, notebook paper...

25
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,242
and... VO5.

26
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,844
Where's the, uh...

27
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,879
where's the protection?

28
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:11,569
See you in about an hour, Sam.

29
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,822

44
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,979
Hi, Ma.

45
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,331
Hey! Look who's here.

46
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,116
Serafina!

47
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:34,414
What are you
doing here? I need to talk to you.

48
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,170
You're pregnant.

49
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,472
REBECCA:
Carla, that is

50
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,240
a rude and unfair thing to say.

51
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,409
There's a million reasons why your
daughter would want to talk to you.

52
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,344
I am pregnant.

53
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,381
Then again, you raised a slut.

54
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,616
Sit down.

55
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,185
Now, oh, God...

56
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,854
first of all...

57
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,089
are you getting sick
in the morning?

58
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:58,025
A little bit, but I
haven't had to "Clavin,"

59
00:02:58,093 --> 00:02:59,694
if that's what you mean.

60
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:03,815
And to answer
your next question,

61
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,583
no, it wasn't planned.

62
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,586
Oh, Serafina...
I have been praying

63
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,805
that this day wouldn't come,

64
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:13,241
but I can't say I'm
all that surprised.

65
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,742
In fact,

66
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,129
I have this little speech
I've been carrying around

67
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,365
in case it did happen.

68
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,739
"Dear Serafina,

69
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:31,676
soon you will be 14 and able
to think for yourself."

70
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,245
Mom.

71
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:34,979
I'm 18.

72
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:36,681
That's right, you are.

73
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,650
None of this applies.

74
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,754
(groans)
So, do you know who the father is?

75
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,022
Yes.

76
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,525
Oh, honey, I'm so proud!

77
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:51,362
It's Pat McDougall,
the guy I've been going with.

78
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,847
Isn't he that retired cop

79
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:55,216
who's just living off
his disability? That's right.

80
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,868
And now he wants to marry me.

81
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,136
Do you love him?

82
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:01,789
Yes.
Then don't marry him.

83
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,424
What?

84
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:06,344
The worst thing you could do,
Serafina, is marry for love.

85
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:09,514
You know, when I first met
your deadbeat father, Nick,

86
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,015
I loved him, too.

87
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:15,519
Even when he knocked up
my sister, I said...

88
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,788
hey, look, the guy
is just trying

89
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:21,125
to get in good with the
family at my wedding.

90
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,847
But for the next ten years,
all he did was cheat on me,

91
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,505
treat me like dirt and keep
me in maternity clothes.

92
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,602
Mom, it's not like that-
Pat's a good man.

93
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,303
He loves me and I love him,

94
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,739
and we want to build
a life for our baby.

95
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,340
Please give us your blessing.

96
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,461
Well... you're not
gonna get that alimony

97
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,196
by staying single.

98
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,048
Mom, you're the best!

99
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,551
Hey, my daughter's
getting married!

100
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,803
Hey!
Oh!

101
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,655
This'll be interesting.
Yeah.

102
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:53,132
Finally, a wedding where
I don't envy the bride.

103
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,995
Thanks, Ma-
you won't regret this.

104
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,597
And listen, Pat and I are
gonna pay for the whole thing.

105
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,782
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you are my daughter,

106
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,051
and you're in love,
and I'm gonna make you

107
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:06,954
the best reception I can-
we're pulling out all the stops.

108
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:10,708
You know, there is an elegant,
tasteful restaurant upstairs,

109
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:13,511
and as luck would have it,
I am boinking the owner.

110
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,966
Hey, Hill! It's Carla.

111
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:21,235
Come on down here,
we got to talk.

112
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,721
Hill? What are you doing?
Come on.

113
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,412
You don't have to
have it up there.

114
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:25,757
Have it down here at Cheers.

115
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,792
Oh, no, no, we can have
the reception here,

116
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,228
but we got to have
the ceremony upstairs. Why?

117
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,331
Every wedding we have
at Cheers is a disaster.

118
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,100
Uh, remember you and Diane?

119
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,601
This place is jinxed.

120
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,137
No, it's not- you're just
thinking of the bad ones.

121
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,272
What about, uh,
Barry and JoAnne?

122
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,074
Barry! Come here.

123
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,743
Barry, how's it going
with you and JoAnne?

124
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,813
Where have you been, in a cave?

125
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,722
All right, Miss Tortelli,
just what is it?

126
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,058
My daughter Serafina has just
announced she's getting married.

127
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,544
Congratulations.

128
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,379
When's the baby due?

129
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:14,438
SERAFINA (calling):
Here I come, Mom! Get ready!

130
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,025
What do you think?

131
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,759
SAM:
That's great, Serafina.

132
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:21,062
You look great.

133
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,481
Kind of sleazy for
a wedding outfit.

134
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:26,750
Sam, that was my wedding dress.

135
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,153
When I say "sleazy,"

136
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,456
I mean sleazy in a beautiful
young bride kind of way.

137
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,529
Carla, is that Cap'n Gus
and his Polka Pirates?

138
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,816
It's my daughter's
wedding, isn't it?

139
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:46,037
Ah, Miss Tortelli,
there you are,

140
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,606
an hour behind schedule, I see.

141
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,143
You're as prompt
as you are lovely.

142
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,045
What do you want, Hill?

143
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,914
And by the way, you have
your toupee on wrong.

144
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,316
The hair goes on the outside.

145
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,636
Miss Tortelli, I'm
here to remind you

146
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:05,473
that this wedding must be
over by 11:30 on the dot.

147
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,108
That's when I open for lunch.

148
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,435
You open for lunch at noon.

149
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,261
I know your family-
they leave at 11:30;

150
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,198
At 11:31 the
Orkin man arrives.

151
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,403
And please also
remind your guests

152
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:21,305
that even though
this is a wedding,

153
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:22,740
it is still a restaurant.

154
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:26,010
No shoes, no shirt, no service.

155
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,796
Hi, everybody.

156
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,981
Hey, Kelly, Woody.

157
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,367
I'll go put this on
the gift table, Woody.

158
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,170
Uh, hey, Woody, what'd you
get for the happy couple?

159
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:39,524
Ah, well, strictly
between you and me,

160
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:43,027
went up in the attic,
dug up one of our wedding gifts.

161
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:46,764
One of the ugliest things
I ever saw.

162
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,866
We couldn't wait
to get rid of it.

163
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,184
Ah, yeah, so you just
thought you'd, uh,

164
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,719
pass it on to the
happy couple, huh?

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Good thinking.

166
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,988
So, uh, what is it?

167
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,242
Oh, a set of
Star Trek steak knives.

168
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,710
FRASIER:
Woody, damn it!

169
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,594
That gift was
from Lilith and me!

170
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:06,468
They're delightfully whimsical
and-and very utilitarian.

171
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,169
Uh, I-I'm sorry Dr. Crane.

172
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,270
I didn't realize.

173
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:11,238
Well, all right, Woody.

174
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,117
To tell you the
truth, I, I was doing

175
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,009
the same thing you
were doing. I...

176
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,795
Fobbing off a gift
that we thought

177
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:20,197
was the worst thing
we ever got.

178
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,315
Thanks a lot, Fras.

179
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,033
That was from Vera and me.

180
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,738
You and Vera gave those away?

181
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,708
You better not tell Ma.

182
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,827
Hey, there.

183
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:33,895
Remember me?

184
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:34,929
Yes, I do.

185
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,898
You're Carla's son, Gino.

186
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,132
And I did not appreciate

187
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:41,735
the nude photos of
yourself that you sent.

188
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,754
You know, it's the best I could
do at the machine at the mall.

189
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,777
Gino, would you
forget about it?

190
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,012
I'm not gonna go out with you.

191
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,213
You're much too young for me.

192
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,315
Oh. Yeah, right.

193
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,983
Coo-coo-ca-choo,
Miss Howe.

194
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,938
Thanks for everything, Mom.

195
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,707
Oh, honey, you know,
I got to admit

196
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,943
that I wasn't too crazy
about this at first.

197
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,563
But after spending this last
week getting the wedding ready

198
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,698
and being with you
and everything,

199
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,067
I got to say it's been
the best week of my life.

200
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,902
Me, too.

201
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:19,907
Ah, am I in time
for the nuptials?!

202
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,878
Daddy!

203
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:25,996
Nick.

204
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,732
My little girl,
you look so beautiful.

205
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,801
(giggles)

206
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:34,071
Are those implants?!

207
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,835
Carla...

208
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,837
it's been a fortnight.

209
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,741
You colouring your hair?

210
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:55,660
I cannot believe this.

211
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,095
What else could
possibly go wrong?

212
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,298
Hi, gang at Cheers!

213
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:02,650
Sorry I'm late,

214
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,852
but I had to park the car.

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,388
And then I had walk
from the car to here.

216
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,443
How did you find out
about this?

217
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,644
My cousin Eddy called me.

218
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,279
He-he told me he
read it in the paper.

219
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,549
So I figured, uh, my invitation
got lost in the mail.

220
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,417
Daddy, I'm so glad you're here.

221
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,152
I can't wait for you
to meet my fiancé.

222
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:23,788
Stay right here;
I'll bring him down. Okay.

223
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,022
Hey, Nick.

224
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,390
Hey, Sam!

225
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,226
Hey. You, are not
welcome here.

226
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,562
Now, you just do us all
a favour and leave, okay?

227
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,031
You have no right to be here.

228
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:34,298
I have a right to be here!

229
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,350
I am the father of the bride!

230
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:40,521
I have a responsibility to give
away the hand of the betrothed!

231
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,990
It's what's called
loin entitlement.

232
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,528
You smelly little wart.

233
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,230
See, Kelly, we're not
the only couple

234
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,521
who has cute little nicknames
for each other.

235
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,554
Carla, I have to be
honest with you.

236
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,089
When I heard about
this wedding,

237
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,624
I was very hurt that
you excluded us.

238
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,594
After all, a marriage is
a time for forgiveness

239
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,730
and healing.

240
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,231
We drove 22 hours to get here.

241
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,465
We even bought a
beautiful present.

242
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,516
(snaps twice)

243
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,604
It's a set of Star
Trek steak knives.

244
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,272
Anyway, I have a
right to be here.

245
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,511
I'm, uh, I'm gonna stay.

246
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,546
Yeah?

247
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,348
You can just drive
22 hours back.

248
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,516
SAM:
Oh, come on, Carla.

249
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:26,984
It took them
so long to get here.

250
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,953
And-and, you know,
he is her father.

251
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,006
Oh, fine, fine.

252
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,441
You want Nick to be at
my daughter's wedding?

253
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,110
Well, you can have him.

254
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:37,712
Just have a great time!

255
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,714
Oh, come on, Carla.

256
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,048
Yeah, women, women.

257
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,950
Isn't it enough
we sleep with them?

258
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:54,145
So, uh, Nick, what have you
been up to lately, huh?

259
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,247
Oh, uh, well, we still live

260
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,015
in the glamorous
environs of Las Vegas,

261
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,650
although we recently did move.

262
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,685
We didn't like
our old neighbourhood,

263
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:05,089
so we just drove our house
to a better one.

264
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,660
Oh, uh, so how's
the career going, Nick?

265
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,928
Last time we chatted,

266
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,597
you were talking
about marketing some kind

267
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,899
of a, slot machine
for the home.

268
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,468
Oh yeah, "Flush and Win."

269
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,803
It was a great idea.

270
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,938
The only problem is that
people had a difficult time

271
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,406
retrieving their change.

272
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,561
Yeah, but I'm onto
something very big now.

273
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:30,264
And this is an opportunity for
me to include you, my friends,

274
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,592
in this future affluence.

275
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,001
Well, you know how I hate
to be apart from Vera...

276
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:37,721
Wait, wait, sit,
sit, hear me out.

277
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,190
I know I've had some crazy
schemes in the past,

278
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:43,127
but this is then and that
was then and this is now.

279
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,815
This is completely legit.

280
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:53,921
I have an opportunity, to
purchase, an orang-utan act.

281
00:12:56,324 --> 00:13:00,544
Did he say
"purchase" or "join"?

282
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,013
Just need a couple of backers.

283
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,983
Hear this: three apes,

284
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,519
some banana oil,

285
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,089
and a broad that's
had all her shots.

286
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:15,842
Nicky, we missed you, lad.

287
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:18,162
CLIFF:
Hey, uh, Nick,

288
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,264
if you want somebody
to invest in that,

289
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,999
uh, act of yours there,
for Vegas,

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,068
you ought to go talk
to blondie over there.

291
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,235
Yeah, she's loaded.

292
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,671
Thank you.

293
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,174
Listen, you come to
Vegas, you're comped.

294
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,896
Excuse me, young man.

295
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,736
Hello Miss.
I'm Nick Tortelli.

296
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,354
Hello. I'm Kelly Boyd.

297
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,957
I can tell by your organda

298
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:50,094
that you have taste
and discernment.

299
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,013
Thank you.

300
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,814
Knock, knock.

301
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,966
Who's there?

302
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,652
Opportunity.

303
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,705
Opportunity who?

304
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,241
This is gonna take some time.

305
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:14,118
People, people,
it's getting late.

306
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,487
Now no one admires the sight
of a beautiful young bride

307
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,223
more than I, but the lunch
rush is the lunch rush.

308
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,593
Say John, I, I bet you'd like
to meet Carla's first husband.

309
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,962
Oh, my God!

310
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:32,002
Nice to meet you.
Please.

311
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,905
My profession requires
that I handle food.

312
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:43,780
Daddy, this is my fiancé, Pat.

313
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:44,898
Nice to meet you, sir.

314
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,317
Aw, enough of
the chit-chat.

315
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,784
Step into my office.

316
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:53,390
How do you propose to,
uh, support my progeny?

317
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,260
Well, I'm a retired
police officer

318
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,329
and currently living
off disability.

319
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:00,146
What is the nature
of your injury?

320
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,465
Whiplash.

321
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,301
Very good, difficult
to disprove.

322
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,504
Very bright.

323
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:08,973
Thank you, sir.

324
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,707
Bright enough to invest?

325
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,009
Pardon me?

326
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,345
Bright enough
to place your future

327
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,080
and the future of
your entire progeny

328
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,449
in the orang-utan act?

329
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,954
Come on, Carla, don't do this.

330
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:26,023
He has no right to be here.

331
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,391
I raised those kids.

332
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,558
He just split.

333
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:29,893
Yeah, I, I know that.

334
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,462
I made all the sacrifices.

335
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,730
I had to bear all the
burden, he did nothing.

336
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,967
Nothing. Well, what are you
gonna do, you know, the guy's here?

337
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,970
(drawer slams)
(yelling in pain)

338
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,106
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

339
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:47,010
Sam, those kids are
all I got, okay?

340
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,145
I know.

341
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,080
They're all that matters to me.

342
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,348
He doesn't care about that.

343
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,683
He doesn't care who he hurts.

344
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:53,917
(knock at door)

345
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,553
Yeah, but...

346
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,238
Sam, Sam could you
hurry it up a bit?

347
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:01,208
Captain Gus has just played the
polka version of "Hava Nagila."

348
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,110
He's managed to
insult two cultures.

349
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm not, I'm not
doing any good here.

350
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,181
Please, please talk
to her, will you?

351
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,516
All right, Sam.

352
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:13,420
Uh, Carla, look, I know what
you're going through.

353
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:16,189
I mean, you've sacrificed
your whole life for your kids

354
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,841
and now, on the big day,

355
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,977
Nick swoops in and tries
to hog all the glory.

356
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,418
Look, it happens all the time.

357
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,310
One parent uses the child as
leverage against the other.

358
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,016
Really, Doc?
Oh yes, yes.

359
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:29,086
Often in a broken marriage
the child becomes nothing more

360
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,423
than, a helpless pawn in the
war between the two adults.

361
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,825
Of course that hasn't happened
with, with Lilith and myself

362
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,394
because she's gone.

363
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,597
But, uh, she'll be back.

364
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,050
Oh, I know she'll be
back, you know why?

365
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:45,819
'Cause I have Frederick.

366
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:47,738
Yes, sir,

367
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,807
he's my little trump card.

368
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,925
Thank you very much.

369
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,076
He is, you know.

370
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:54,311
I have a plan.

371
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,713
(laughs evilly)

372
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,266
You're Nick, right?

373
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,367
Yes.

374
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:01,602
I'm Rebecca Howe.

375
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,404
I work here
in the bar with Carla.

376
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:05,972
And I just want to say
you must be very proud.

377
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,242
Oh I'm very proud.
Yes.

378
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,610
I know the last thing
that I would want to do

379
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,546
is introduce a dark note,

380
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,866
but if you don't get your hand off
my butt, you're gonna lose it.

381
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:20,037
NORM:
Sammy, how'd it go in there?

382
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,104
Oh, not good.

383
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,907
She refuses to come out.
I don't know...

384
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,476
Don't worry about it, Sam.
I'll handle it.

385
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,211
Carla, at times,
can be very obdurate.

386
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:32,783
She also can be
very recalcitrant,

387
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:38,488
intransigent and immovable.

388
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:42,292
Nicky got one of those
word-a-day calendars.

389
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,362
We played word games
all the way from Las Vegas.

390
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,097
I'm insipid.

391
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,836
Carla.
Go home, Nick.

392
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,204
You don't deserve to be here.

393
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,574
Carla, listen, I, I understand
your feelings very well.

394
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,010
I know some people probably
thought I was a bad father

395
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:03,180
and maybe I was and maybe I
wasn't, and maybe I was.

396
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:07,884
I speak to you from the bottom
of my heart and guts,

397
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,187
that these last few years
without family

398
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,122
has been very empty for me.

399
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,557
All I've had is Loretta.

400
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,058
No offence.

401
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,227
None taken.

402
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:22,933
I've come to learn that the most
important thing is family.

403
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,002
Yeah, I know,
I come at this late date

404
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,270
for Serafina's wedding,

405
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,201
but I thought
it would be a first step,

406
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,608
in realigning myself
with my offspring

407
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:33,594
and them becoming truly
a paternity figure.

408
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:36,480
So you want to be a father.

409
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,915
You want to get back
in your kids' lives, huh?

410
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,851
Absolutely.

411
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,052
Come over here.

412
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,487
Let's go.

413
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,091
Over here we have...

414
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,494
ten kids.

415
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,529
Some of them are yours.

416
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:56,316
Identify three,
and you can stay.

417
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,885
Otherwise you're out of here.

418
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:00,386
Is this a test?

419
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,422
You're stalling.

420
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,060
Give me some time
to gather my momentum.

421
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,495
So, Miss Howe,
we've got five minutes.

422
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:09,830
You want to tear one off?

423
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,515
That's mine!

424
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,755
Okay, that's one.

425
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,103
Hugo, my beloved.

426
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,238
Hugo.

427
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,574
Sorry, Nick, that's
not your kid.

428
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,459
You know you people
could help me.

429
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,878
FRASIER:
I wouldn't be much good.

430
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,681
I thought your last
selection was correct.

431
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,366
Uh, I think it's about time.

432
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,901
Let's start the ceremony.

433
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,003
Oh, that's Serafina.
She's one of mine.

434
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,538
Aw, forget it Nick.

435
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,341
Let's face it,
you can't do this.

436
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,376
Aw... Loretta.
Hit the road.

437
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:58,979
Go on, kids, go on upstairs and
get ready for the ceremony.

438
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,113
Come on, let's go.

439
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,865
What's happening?

440
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,651
Your mother doesn't
feel I belong here.

441
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,153
She says I'm unwelcome.

442
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,907
Mother, you can't
send Daddy away

443
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,909
on the most important
day of my life.

444
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,477
Listen, Serafina,
you've gotta understand...

445
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,228
No, this is not about you.

446
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:19,349
It's about me-
my wedding, my day.

447
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,785
Have a nice life, baby.

448
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,387
Wait one minute, Daddy.

449
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:28,375
Look, Ma, I know all the
things you've done for me.

450
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:29,909
I know you don't like Daddy,

451
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:32,212
but like him or not,
he is my dad.

452
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,931
I know he's been
a bad father...

453
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,633
never around when you need him,

454
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,336
a louse, a jerk,

455
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,005
a liar, a deadbeat.

456
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:43,390
You tell her, honey.

457
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,296
You know, all my life
I've always pictured

458
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:51,247
that someday I would
walk down the aisle

459
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:54,785
on my father's arm,
just like any other girl.

460
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,572
Not like every
other girl, Serafina.

461
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,741
My father wasn't
there to give me away.

462
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:02,593
And how'd that make
you feel, Mom?

463
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:07,865
Pretty rotten.

464
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:10,517
Sayonara, Serafina.

465
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:12,802
Oh wait, Nick.

466
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,204
You can stay.

467
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,957
Really?
Thanks, Mom.

468
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,459
Look, you, listen...

469
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:22,145
you do anything to ruin
my lovely daughter's wedding,

470
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:25,315
and I will choke you
until your eyes bug out.

471
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,336
(voice breaking):
It's just like The Waltons.

472
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,674
LORETTA: ♪ What are you doing

473

475
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,752
Carla, look at
our kid out there.

476
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,055
She's pregnant, married
to a retired cop.

477
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:50,324
We must have done
something right.

478
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,509
Yeah.

479
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,745
Maybe our other kids
will turn out okay, too.

480
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,613
That is my most fervent wish.

481
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,281
(phone ringing)

482
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,417
Cheers.

483
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:01,551
Oh, just a second.

484
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,986
Mr. Tortelli,
it's for you.

485
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,871
For me?

486
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:07,140
Hello.

487
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,009
What?

488
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,879
What? When?

489
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,514
(yelling):
All right, I'll be on it!

490
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:15,748
Loretta, let's go!

491
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,500
WOODY:
What's the matter?

492
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,619
One of the orang-utans
went nuts and bit a kid.

493
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,255
I've got to rush to Vegas
before they put him to sleep.

494
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:23,516
The orang-utan or the kid?

495
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,942
I didn't ask.

496
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,180
Thanks again
for everything, Mom.

497
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,615
I'm happy.

498
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,285
Serafina, I really
want to apologize

499
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,554
for the way I acted
this afternoon.

500
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:42,825
And I promise I'll be on my best
behaviour at your next wedding.

501
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:46,396
Oh, Ma.
