00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:18,666
Well, listen, fellows, 
         there's no need        
         to fight over these.

10
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:19,868
I mean,                 
        i got double prints.

         he looks most like,

13
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,025
me or lilith? Hmm?

14
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,259
Oh, kind of hard   
             to tell there.

15
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,328
Oh, well, here, let me  
        make it easier for you.

16
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:31,830
I just happen          
         to have newborn photos

 look at this?

00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:39,704
3 days old                     
 and lilith already had         
 her hair back in a bun.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,841
I think the kid looks      
     like his mom, frase.

21
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,710
Yeah, i do, too.

22

         It's not just a shot.

 would like to chat             
 with carl yastrzemski.

118
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,427
But since he knows         
     jack about baseball,

119
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,496
he decided to invite           
 old mayday along

120
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,814
to come to dinner with you     
 so i can translate.

123
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:40,205

 the first time i've been       
 alone with robin in a month.

 in your way, honey.

 in the fact

127
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:48,563
that i'm going around          
 with robin colcord.

128
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,617
Really stick it to 'em,        
 you know.

Man, you are gonna     
         ruin everything.

131
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,356
What ruin? It's gonna          
 save you from having

132
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:02,076
to come up with                
 another excuse not to go       
 to bed with the guy.

133
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,946
What makes you think       
     i'm not going to go        
     to bed with the guy?

134
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,732
Well, honey, you know,         
 you see the sun                
 come up every morning

135
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,966
for 30, 40 years,

136
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,519
after a while,                 
 you start to trust it.

137
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,056
Hey, i bet michele         
     will be really impressed

138
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:18,059
to find out that she's 
         spending her birthday  
         with robin colcord.

139
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,544
Robin colcord?                 
 I'd be impressed.

140
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,865
Woody.                 
         You know the number.

141
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,935
Damn that robin colcord,    
    changing plans like that    
    at the last minute.

142
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,121
You know, just because      
    that guy's got a couple     
    of bucks in his pocket,

143
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,340
he just thinks he can shuttle  
 people around like cattle.

144
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,743
Moo-ve along, bossy.    
        It's milking time.

145
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:39,947
Uh, michele?

146
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,082
Michele, sweetheart,       
     listen, um,

147
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,152
i hate to do this to you,      
 but i-i'm gonna have to        
 call it off again.

148
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,789
Well, maybe                
     next weekend, huh?

149
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,990
Ok. Bye-bye, honey.

150
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:50,925
Thanks.

151
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,847
Boy, you know, it's too bad    
 that you and i                 
 didn't hit it off.

152
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,181
I just got invited

153
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:01,436
to the carl yastrzemski    
     dinner with robin colcord.

154
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,370
Really?

155
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:04,088
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

156
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:08,276
Yeah, we'll be going over  
     in robin colcord's         
     stretch limo.

157
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,311
Then, uh, robin colcord

158
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,614
will be treating us         
    to a $1,000 plate,

159
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:17,418
which we will be eating        
 sitting next to robin colcord.

160
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,386
And then, you know,

161
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,188
maybe we'll go out      
        for ice cream later

162
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,607
with sam malone.

163
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:24,842
Who's that?

164
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,744
A friend of robin colcord's.

165
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,680
Come on. What do you say?

166
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:32,266
[Sighing]                   
    well, i'm still not sure    
    i believe you,

167
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,568
but i'll take my chances.

168
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:36,687
All right, great.  
             See you back here, 
             what, 7:30?

169
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,756
I'll be here.              
                    All right.

170
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,007
It's ringing, sam.

171
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,543
No, i don't need it            
 this time. Thanks, woody.

172
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,827
Oh.

173
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,729
Oh, hello, michele?

174
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,899
Uh, yeah,                      
 i just wanted to tell you      
 that sam still can't make it.

175
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,803
Me?

176
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:56,207
Oh, i'm about, uh, 6 feet,     
 blond hair, early 20s.

177
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:57,475
A little party?

178
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,744
Oh, sure.                  
     I love birthday cake.

179
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,113
Is it ok if i bring        
     my girlfriend?

180
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,116
Hello?

181
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,355
It's 8:45.

182
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,491
That's it.         
             I am out of here.  
     Oh.

183
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,093
Hey, come on, laura.   
         Colcord will be here.

184
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,561
Maybe he's confused.

185
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,431
You know, may-maybe         
    he's still on swedish time.

186
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,603
What's that you say?           
 You're a member                
 of the nazi party?

187
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,005
Well, forget it, babe.         
 I draw the line.

188
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,708
Oh, phew! Narrow escape, guys.

189
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,393
[Office door opening]       
 (sam)                          
 did you see that?

190
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:35,830
Where is he?               
     Where in the hell is he?

191
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:41,185
You think you got a beef?      
 I just had to dump my date     
 for political reasons.

192
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,303
You know, that guy leaves me   
 for 4 or 5 weeks at a time,

193
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:46,340
and then, when i do have       
 a date with him,               
 he's an hour and a half late.

194
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:48,542
What, like there's no phones?  
 He can't give me a call?

195
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,012
I'm getting sick of this.   
    I don't know                
    why i put up with it.

196
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:54,265
Rebecca,               
         don't you remember?    
         You're a gold digger.

197
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,220
Well, i'm tired            
     of wasting my time         
     and cleavage on him.

198
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,575
Chop-chop, everyone.           
 Let's go.

199
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,012
Excuse me?

200
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,617
Some of us were ready   
        to chop-chop            
        an hour and a half ago.

201
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,984
Rebecca, you look lovely.

202
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:16,404
I looked lovelier           
    an hour and a half ago.

203
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,422
Oh, darling,                
    we all age, you know.

204
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,375
Sam, you coming?

205
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:23,511
Uh, you know, actually         
 i think i'm gonna take a cab.

206
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:26,214
My date fell through           
 at the last minute, there,     
 and i feel a little awkward.

207
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,999
You know what they say, 
        "3 in a limo..."

208
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,567
oh, well, actually,            
 there will be 4 of us.

209
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,952
Uh, that's including        
    my driver, miles.

210
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,156
Oh, great. I'll look like  
     i'm dating the chauffeur.

211
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,108
Listen, i mean,            
     i like miles and all--

212
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,593
yes, well, he likes        
     you, too, sam.

213
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,746
Well, then i'm definitely  
     taking a cab.

214
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,531
I'll meet you there.

215
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,817
But, sam, i need you           
 to brief me in advance         
 about this baseball thing.

216
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,987
Now, look, i'll give you    
    a consultation fee          
    of $1,000.

217
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,674
What kind of flowers    
        do you think            
        miles would like?

218
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:01,499
All right.     
                 Keystone sack. 
         2nd base.

219
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,284
Hot corner. 
         3rd base.

220
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,602
Dinger?

221
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:06,237
Home run.

222
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:07,421
Tater.         
 Home run.

223
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:09,190
Ah, right. 
         He's good,             
         isn't he?

224
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,708
Ah, yes,                       
 he's wonderful.

225
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,477
We shouldn't                   
 go anywhere                    
 without him. Ever.

226
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,879
Do i detect an attitude?       
 Attitude?

227
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,798
Listen, when we meet   
         yastrzemski,           
        mmm.

228
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,283
We all just call him yaz.

229
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,737
You know, actually, robin,     
 this is, like, my dream date.

230
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,623
I hope we spend                
 the rest of the night          
 talking about how many taters

231
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,424
yaz has hit.

232
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,128
Rebecca, if there is       
     something bothering you,   
     we can discuss it later.

233
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,697
So, how many taters        
     did yaz hit?

234
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,098
Oh, um...

235
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:36,517
later? Later?                  
 You mean like                  
 when we're alone?

236
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:37,968
I don't think                  
 that's gonna--

237
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,170
anyway, rebecca, um,   
         if there's something's 
         bothering you,

238
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,039
why don't you just 
             come straight out  
             and say it?

239
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,908
Robin, if you can't            
 figure it out, i'm really      
 not going to tell you.

240
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,644
Oh, god,           
             that is so female.

241
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,846
Don't ever say that            
 to a woman,

242
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:49,964
you big jerk!

243
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,032
Little shrew.

244
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:52,399
Shut up.

245
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,268
Fine.

246
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,236
[Sighing]

247
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,639
i don't know       
             the exact number   
             of taters yaz hit.

248
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:00,074
But i know     
                 it was a lot.

249
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:06,814
Hey, you know      
             what we need here?

250
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,482
We need             
            a little champagne.

251
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,583
[Clears throat]

252
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,151
all right.             
         Oh, i tell you, robin,

253
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,854
baseball,               
        it's the greatest game.

254
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:16,123
The only little    
             problem i see is,

255
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,825
is in the pension system.

256
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:21,295
I mean,                
         where's the security   
         for a marginal player?

257
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:24,865
Oh. Hey, this is       
         very nice champagne.

258
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,600
Yeah, nice and bubbly.

259
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:30,170
Not like the kind of stuff 
     we used to pour over       
     yaz's head

260
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,873
after he hit           
         a game-winning tater.

261
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,009
Oh, my god.

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,965
Oh, sam,                   
     you're still here.

263
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,900
Kind of feel like          
     i shouldn't be.

264
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,835
Oh, well, we'd         
         appreciate that, sam.

265

     to a guy like colcord.

401
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,300
I don't know,      
             he's got her out   
             on a boat now.

402
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,269
I mean, what about that?

403
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:10,120
And i know why.                
 He's taking her out there      
 to dump her,

404
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,889
you know,                  
     a quick burial at sea.

405
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,925
Trust me,                      
 she's probably swimming back   
 right now,

406
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:16,560
a little wetter, but wiser.

407
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:21,782
He did it.

408
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,084
He said it.

409
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:25,653
Those 3 little words.

410
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,254
"Walk the plank."

411
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,441
No, sam.

412
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,277
"I

413
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,478
"love

414
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,547
you."

415
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,815
Woody,             
             does anybody have  
             "i love you?"

416
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,087
Closest we got here is,

417
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,689
"i'll respect you              
 in the morning."               
 Cliff clavin.

418
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,577
I'm just so happy.

419
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:53,213
You know, all i wanna do       
 is celebrate.

420
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,631
Come on, you guys,         
     you're my pals.

421
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,433
Come on,                   
     let's go have fun.

422
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,552
I don't know, we're really 
     kind of settled in here    
     for the evening, you know?

423
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,157
Little wally's pup 'n' burger.

424
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:05,408
I'm there.  
         Well, hey,             
         all righty.

425
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,977
Come on, sammy.         
        It'll be a lot more fun

426
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,046
than that red sox dinner   
     would have been.           
        Yeah.

427
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:10,847
And it won't cost           
    $1,000 a plate.

428
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,866
No, little wally's     
         doesn't have plates.

429
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,835
They just serve            
     on those wax paper things.

430
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:17,304
You can scratch        
         your, uh, initials in  
         with your fingernails.

431
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,739
And if little wally        
     is in a good mood

432
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:20,307
you can scratch        
         your initials in him.

433
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:21,691
(Norm)                         
 it's great.

434
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,627
Sam, come on.          
         Aren't you coming?

435
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,064
Uh, no.                        
 I think, you know,             
 i better watch the bar here.

436
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,332
But carla's here,      
         and woody's here.

437
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,218
Yeah, i know,              
     i--i should stay, though.

438
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:34,488
I mean, somebody mixed     
     some filberts in           
     with the walnuts,

439
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,206
and i got to               
     straighten it out.

440
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,861
Sam?

441
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,329
Yeah.

442
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:44,348
What's the matter?  
            Is something wrong?

443
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,801
Are you disappointed?

444
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,904
Well, uh,                      
 why would i be disappointed?

445
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,390
Well, i guess      
             i kind of thought  
             you wanted me.

446
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,375
[Sighs]

447
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:58,194
what would give you            
 that idea?

448
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:01,397
I don't know.      
             A guy hits on you  
             every day

449
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:04,384
for 3 or 4 years,  
             you kind of start  
             to trust it.

450
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,674
All right. Yeah. Maybe         
 i'm a little disappointed.

451
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,275
[Clears throat]

452
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:14,894
i thought we'd be           
    cool together, you know.

453
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:17,397
You know,                   
    go out for a while,         
    do stuff.

454
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,418
Ah, but what the hell,         
 you know?

455
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,971
We'd probably end up           
 not liking each other's stuff.

456
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,441
You'd have to do my stuff      
 for a while,                   
 and i'd do your stuff,

457
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:28,942
and our stuff                  
 would get all mixed up.

458
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,009
[Exclaims]

459
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:31,111
[laughing]

460
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:32,829
saves us a lot of          
     aggravation, huh?

461
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,164
Yeah.

462
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,916
I'm very happy for you.

463
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,934
Thanks.

464
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,368
Let's go eat.                  
                            Ok.

465
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:43,290
Do me one favor though, 
        will you?

466
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:44,524
Sure, what is it?

467
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:45,692
Go to bed with me.

468
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,361
Oh, sam,               
         you never stop.

469
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:49,897
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,932
It's in my genes.

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,067
That's where       
             it's gonna stay.   
        Yeah.

472
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,306
Hey,                    
        where did everybody go?

473
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,675
Uh, rebecca took some          
 of the guys out to dinner.

474
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:03,827
Oh, great.                 
     They're all off at dinner

475
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,062
having a good time, 
            and i'm stuck here

476
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,998
with my little 
                 wally burger.

477
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,871
Oh, no. They screwed   
         my order up again.

478
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,672
Last time               
        they forgot the tomato.

479
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,777
This time they forgot   
        the tomato, lettuce,    
        hamburger, and the bun.

480
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,448
Oh, so, what have i got?   
     Nothing.

481
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:35,108
[Door bells chiming]

482
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,594
(norm)                         
 oh, yeah. Rebecca knows        
 how to throw a party, huh?

483
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,763
This has to be                 
 my favorite restaurant         
 in the whole city.

484
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,964
(Cliff)                        
 come on, i thought you said

485
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:42,232
the hungry heifer              
 was your favorite.

486
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,051
Yeah, sure. You know,

487
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:45,451
you got folks      
             from out of town   
             or something,

488
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,271
you wanna impress them, 
        you wanna sit down,     
        maybe, yeah.

489
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,540
But, you know,                 
 you just wanna power down      
 the animal fat, wally's rules.

490
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,426
Yeah, all i know       
         is that i'm stuffed,

491
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,144
and i couldn't eat 
             another bite.

492
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:57,414
I could use                    
 a little something to, uh,     
 settle the old stomach.

493
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,216
What are you           
         talking about there?

494
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:01,017
Let's go by cheers.     
                 All right,     
                 capital idea.

495
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,870
Sure, sure, sure.

496
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:04,955
So, you know,              
     how come i only got        
     to eat one burger?

497
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,024
(Norm)                         
 it's 'cause                    
 you're the designated driver.

498
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:09,392
(Norm)             
             guys, goodnight.

499
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,061
Bye-bye.                       
 Thanks for coming.             
                 See you!

500
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,066
Oh, sam. Isn't this            
 a beautiful night?

501
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:18,936
Yeah. I especially love    
     the way the neon light

502
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,654
shows up           
             that grease stain  
             on your blouse.

503
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,524
There is a grease stain.

504
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:24,891
I'm gonna leave it there

505
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,510
'cause it'll remind me         
 of this place                  
 for the rest of my life.

506
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:29,613
It's stupid, isn't it?

507
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,016
I'm gonna go inside            
 and clean it off.

508
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:38,121
Sam, i know that this          
 probably looks like            
 some dive to you,

509
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:40,356
but tonight, to me,            
 it looks like

510
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:43,643
the most wonderful place       
 in the world.

511
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,979
And this is where              
 i found out that

512
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:49,766
i was robin colcord's          
 one and only.

513
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,151
I'll be right back.

514
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:54,537
Don't take too long.

515
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,839
I won't.

516

[Giggling]

517
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,399
this place 
                     is nice?

518
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:07,601
Oh, yes. I bring       
         a lot of               
         people here,

519
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,135
you'll love it.     
                     Ok.

520
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:10,353
Hi, sam.
