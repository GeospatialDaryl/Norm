1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:05,321
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:08,658
Guinness stout and a gin and tonic.

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,410
Something the matter, Carla?

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,195
Yeah, something's the matter.

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,697
My life is the pits.

6
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:15,115
Seems like good things happen

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,367
to everybody except me, you know?

8
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,668
Norm has a new job.

9
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:21,171
Frasier actually seems happy

10
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,673
since he met his creepy girlfriend.

11
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:28,678
And Sam has given up women
and decided to marry Diane.

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,547
And what have I got? Zip.

13
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,515
Woody, I mean, how do you keep

14
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:34,517
such a sunny disposition

15
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:37,020
in this rotten, stink-infested world?

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,521
You mean, what do I do

17
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,524
when I see Mr. Blues
peeking around the corner?

18
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:42,525
Oh, God,

19
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:47,030
he even has a cute name for depression.

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,034
Well, I just close my eyes,
and I think a happy thought.

21
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,902
Here, I-I'll show you.

22
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,414
What was your thought?

23
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,082
I'm glad I'm not you.

24
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:15,058

Hey, Mr. Peterson. Yeah.

40
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,029
I'm working on this month's
issue of the Cheers newsletter,

41
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,280
and I wondered

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,566
what's new with you?

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,484
Nothing, really, Woody.

44
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,286
Well, you sure?

45
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,038
Uh, I don't know. Check last month.

46
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,039
What was I up to then?

47
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,409
Let's see. Norm Peterson.

48
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,743
Nothing.

49
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,162
Oh.

50
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,664
Well, I guess it's not new then, eh?

51
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,667
How about you, Dr. Crane?

52
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,918
What's new in my life?

53
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,720
Well, it's not easily
put into words, Wood.

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,222
Perhaps it has something to do

55
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,723
with my relationship with Lilith.

56
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,592
And perhaps it's just a maturity

57
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,560
that comes with age.

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,564
All I know is that I feel
I finally know who I am,

59
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:04,067
and I'm happy with that person.

60
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,435
Does that answer your question?

61
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,236
Sure does.

62
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,488
Dr. Crane: Nothing.

63
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,992
Sam!

64
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,327
Great news!

65
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,612
I found a house.

66
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,613
Hey!

67
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,582
Turn it in. Maybe you'll get a reward.

68
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,583
No, you goose.

69
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:23,086
I found our house.

70
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,587
I was driving to work today

71
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:27,590
and, as luck would have it,
there was an eight-car smash-up.

72
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,212
Yeah, that didn't come out right.

73
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,630
What I meant was I was forced to take

74
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,131
an alternate route,

75
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,518
and it sent me right
past the perfect house.

76
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, Sam, you should see it.

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,355
Three bedrooms, two and a half baths,

78
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,856
a formal dining room,

79
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,858
a huge fireplace in the living room.

80
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,859
Excuse me for interrupting,

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,728
but we're not looking for a house.

82
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,697
I know. I already found it.

83
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,699
No, I mean that we agreed

84
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,702
to live in my apartment
for a year first.

85
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,204
Well, yes,

86
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,073
that was the original plan. Yeah.

87
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,409
But that was before
I saw hardwood floors,

88
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,212
bay windows, crown moldings.

89
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,213
Yeah, well,

90
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,082
so what's wrong with my apartment?

91
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,384
Well, granted this house

92
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,887
doesn't have your view of
the Exotic Dancing Academy.

93
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,225
But I think you could learn to live

94
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,727
in the shade of a stately elm.

95
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,480
Oh, uh, I, uh, hate
to be a buttinsky here,

96
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,566
but, uh,

97
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,601
this is the absolute
worst time to buy a house.

98
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,435
Why is that?

99
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,436
Ah, seller's market.

100
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,938
Unless you run into
that, uh, rare breed,

101
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,323
you know, the motivated seller.

102
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,607
Now, you know, for a price,

103
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,526
I could put you in a sweet little, uh,

104
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,527
three-bed,
two-bath number.

105
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,030
Uh, it's got, uh,
fishnetting over the patio

106
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,534
and a handmade, uh, uh, lava
rock fire pit in the back.

107
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,836
Cliffie, uh, that sounds a
little bit like your house.

108
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,204
It is my house, Norm.

109
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,589
NORM: Wait, wait, wait now.

110
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,873
You said your mother
was going to live there

111
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,125
till the day she died.

112
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,961
Well, uh, she's clean,
and she doesn't eat much.

113
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,463
Sam, please.

114
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,465
Just come with me and take a look at it.

115
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,467
I'm not-I'm not ready to own a home.

116
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
It's a... you-you got
to work up to that.

117
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,854
Sammy's right.

118
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,105
It's a big responsibility.

119
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,607
You got uh, lawns to mow.

120
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,058
You got plumbing to fix.

121
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,310
You got gutters to clean.

122
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,611
Then, you know, every couple of years,

123
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,613
you got to paint the entire
thing from top to bottom.

124
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,982
Honestly, I don't know where
Vera gets the energy sometimes.

125
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,536
Norm, you should be ashamed of yourself.

126
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,538
Yeah, I guess I should, shouldn't I?

127
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:25,541
You know, thank God I'm not, huh?

128
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,960
Well, Sam and I will split
the chores at our house.

129
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,961
Would you just slow down?

130
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,963
We're not buyin' a house. I mean it.

131
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,832
Now, Sam, don't be so hasty.

132
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,167
This could be the house for you.

133
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,551
Does it have a basement?

134
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,469
Yes, it does. A large one.

135
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,837
Great.

136
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,723
You can convert it into a
dungeon to keep Diane in.

137
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:43,176
Then, when you're done torturing her,

138
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,679
you could bury the body
under the cement floor,

139
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,681
cover it with a Ping-Pong table.

140
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,067
Well, maybe. I don't know.

141
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:51,851
Sam.

142
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,237
No, no, maybe you, not her.

143
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,157
Will you stop stalling
and come with me, please?

144
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,159
Just give me one good
reason why I should.

145
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,613
Because we own it.

146
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,615
That's a pretty good reason, Sam.

147
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,120
You bought a house without asking me?

148
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,623
Well, I-I didn't exactly buy it.

149
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,626
Uh-huh. I put down the teeniest

150
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,511
of refundable deposits.

151
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,712
You know, I don't believe this.

152
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,681
Oh, now, Sam, there was
another couple there,

153
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,683
and they were all ready
to make a bid on it.

154
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,550
I had to move quickly.

155
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,018
Yeah, talking about moving quickly,

156
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,019
you get into my office right now

157
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,021
and you call them tell them
that I want my deposit back.

158
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,023
Okay, Sam, whatever you say.

159
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,525
But first I want to call the decorator

160
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,526
about ordering drapes.

161
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,895
Yeah, well, make it quick.

162
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,363
Well, I guess it's
time we started thinking

163
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,364
about a housewarming gift.

164
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:39,866
Ah, it's pathetic.

165
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,367
Yeah, you'd never catch a woman of mine

166
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,869
leading me around by the nose.

167
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,872
No, but you might catch her
sunning herself on a rock.

168
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,391
It's ours.

169
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,895
It's finally ours. I can't believe it.

170
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,897
Neither can I.

171
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,899
Wow, you know, every time I come here

172
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,400
I like this place more and more.

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,402
Oh. (chuckles)

174
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,405
Thank God you talked
me into this. Oh, yeah.

175
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,407
Oh.

176
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,326
You don't think we spent
too much money on it?

177
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,827
Oh, absolutely.

178
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,829
What the hell?

179
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:27,830
It's a great house.

180
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,831
Yeah. And it's ours.

181
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,333
Well, not quite yet.

182
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,701
You know, I never feel at home

183
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,670
until I hang this little baby up.

184
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,672
Oh, God, Sam.

185
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:37,673
What?

186
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,176
Oh, not where people can see it.

187
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,677
You know, I have never understood

188
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:43,179
your attitude about this painting.

189
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,430
I mean, it's a classic.

190
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,265
"Dogs Playing

191
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,767
Blackjack."

192
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,274
(laughing)

193
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,278
I never look at this
without cracking up.

194
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,146
Ah.

195
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,115
Well, that's the purpose of great art.

196
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,116
You know something? I think you,

197
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,118
you're missing the subtle humor here.

198
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,120
I mean, see this guy
right here? He's cheating.

199
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,121
(laughs)

200
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,124
Oh. Oh, Sam,

201
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,627
I can hardly wait till
I'm in the kitchen,

202
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,630
pot holders in hand,
cooking a nice big roast,

203
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,999
calling out to you,
"Dinner's ready, honey."

204
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,335
"I'll be right there.
I'm in the workshop."

205
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,337
The workshop?

206
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,506
Oh, yeah, yeah.

207
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,757
My dad always had one.

208
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,259
I used to go down there all the time.

209
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,145
I just loved the smell of sawdust.

210
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,398
Wonder where I can buy some of that.

211
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:36,899
(laughs)

212
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,267
Oh, Sam,

213
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,652
I have wonderful plans

214
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,653
for every room in the entire house.

215
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,154
That's funny, so do I.

216
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,656
(laughs)

217
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,659
Why don't we start right
here in the living room?

218
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,160
Yeah, these floors
look like they could use

219
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,663
a little polishing. Oh, Sam. Sam.

220
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,165
MAN: We really have
to leave now, my dear.

221
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,668
WOMAN: Yes, I guess you're right.

222
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,170
Uh, hello? Hello?

223
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,173
Oh. You must be the new owner.

224
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,174
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh,

225
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,676
I'm Sam Malone. How do you do?

226
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,677
How are you?

227
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,629
This is my, uh, fiancée, Diane Chambers.

228
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,631
Hi. Bert and Lillian Miller.

229
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,632
Oh. Hi, how are you?

230
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,134
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, it's a pleasure.

231
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,020
The house is beautiful. Mmm.

232
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,804
Oh, yes, yes.

233
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
Well, of course, we know

234
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,307
we're supposed to be out of here by now,

235
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,310
but, well, we forgot a few
odds and ends, you know?

236
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,695
And, uh,

237
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,648
well, we just wanted
to take a last look.

238
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,149
Well, you know,

239
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,535
when you've lived in
a house for 40 years,

240
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,537
taking that last step out the door,

241
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,039
well, it-it-it's
pretty hard.

242
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,540
Of course.

243
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,544
I confess, I... touched
liquor this morning.

244
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,051
Oh, tha... that's all right, my girl.

245
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,053
But you look like a fine couple.

246
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,056
I'm glad the house is
going to you. Thank you.

247
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,058
Oh, yeah, yeah, we plan
to do great things in it--

248
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,927
with it, with it.

249
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,896
So many memories.

250
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,898
Like when Mikey climbed
up the bookshelves

251
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,899
and hit his head on the mantle.

252
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,900
You remember?

253
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,903
Oh, we were all so worried.

254
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,404
And that's where little Janey

255
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,406
rehearsed her dance for the school play.

256
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,407
Oh.

257
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,410
You know, I studied ballet as a child.

258
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,912
So I became quite experien...

259
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,413
Berty Junior

260
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,198
took his first steps

261
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,000
on this very spot right here.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,003
And... that's where we
always put our Christmas tree.

263
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,371
LILLIAN: Every year.

264
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,373
40 Christmases.

265
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,875
Thirty-nine.

266
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,376
Hmm?

267
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,878
Well, we didn't quite make it

268
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,379
to Christmas this year.

269
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,881
Oh, sure.

270
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,132
BERT: You know,

271
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,433
I think we'll

272
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,936
miss the Christmases most of all.

273
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,437
I know, Bert.

274
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,939
The children

275
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,308
and the grandchildren.

276
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,310
BERT: Ah, never mind.

277
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,611
There, there now.

278
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,613
Out with the old.

279
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,115
And in with the new.

280
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,117
Now, we're just going
to get out of your way,

281
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,485
so that you two can

282
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,953
share your lives.

283
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:54,954
Well, good luck to you. Thank you.

284
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,706
Can I help you with those boxes there?

285
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:57,540
Oh no, they'll be fine. No.

286
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,041
We're just going as far as the bus stop.

287
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,409
Okay, okay.

288
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,877
Have a nice day.

289
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:03,129
SAM: Yeah. Glad to meet you. Thank you.

290
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:03,963
Good-bye.

291
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,331
Good-bye.

292
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,169
(weepy): Good-bye, house.

293
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
SAM: Bye-bye.

294
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,671
BERT: Bye-bye now.

295
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,591
Gee, what a sweet couple, huh?

296
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,594
Let's see, where were we?

297
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,595
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I think we were, uh,

298
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,097
talking about polishing the floor.

299
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,601
Do want to wax or shall we buff?

300
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,105
I cannot live a single
day in this house.

301
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,610
Oh, God.

302
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,083
SAM: Come on, come on.

303
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,085
It's all right.

304
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,087
I mean it, Sam.

305
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,089
I could never live here.

306
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,091
No, don't say that. Don't say that.

307
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,093
Listen, hey, I got a surprise for you.

308
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,596
Look, I took the picture down.

309
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:56,098
Sam, it has nothing
to do with the picture.

310
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:59,101
I-I... Although I do appreciate that.

311
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,603
This place belongs

312
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,605
to Bert and Lillian.

313
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,607
It's alive with their memories.

314
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:10,112
Oh, poor Mikey. Now,
that must have smarted.

315
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,615
Come on, come on, we love this house.

316
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,117
Now, I know how you
feel right now, but...

317
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:17,119
but wait till we make some changes here.

318
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,621
Look, we can... we can...

319
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:19,622
we can knock out this wall right here

320
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,123
and make the whole room different.

321
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,625
I mean, yeah, what
the hell? Look at that.

322
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,627
They got writing all over this wall.

323
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,629
Oh, look.

324
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,131
"Mikey at one year, 30 inches."

325
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:33,385
"Bert Jr. at two years, 36 inches."

326
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,605
How can you possibly
think of tearing this down?

327
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,107
Can't you see

328
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,276
this is a record of their lives?

329
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,193
Well, all I can see

330
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,196
is that little Janey here was a moose.

331
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,620
How'd you like to have that
coming at you in a tutu, huh?

332
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,875
You have the sensitivity
of a dung beetle.

333
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,743
I'm just trying to
lighten the mood up here.

334
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,629
Well, I'm not in the
mood for fun and games.

335
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:03,382
Well... ALL: Happy housewarming!

336
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,384
Hey, hey...

337
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,385
No, don't.

338
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,888
This isn't our house.
We don't belong in it.

339
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,639
I'll never live here.

340
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,308
Not one day, not one minute.

341
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,809
Please, leave, please.

342
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:21,317
You know, Sammy, a couple of years ago,

343
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,318
this might've taken me by surprise,

344
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,321
but now I just kind of roll with it.

345
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,325
This is great!

346
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,827
I got the one where
they're on the train.

347
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,830
Yeah. Not now, Woody.

348
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,833
(laughs)

349
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,834
Look at that.

350
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,336
I never noticed that.

351
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,837
The bloodhound's doubling down.

352
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:42,838
Look at that.

353
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,759
(horn honks)

354
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,762
Uh, I'm sorry about this, you guys.

355
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,764
It's a... it's a bad time.

356
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,266
CARLA: Wait till the honeymoon!

357
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,775
We're trespassers here, Sam.

358
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,277
The love and warmth
that fill these walls

359
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,278
didn't come from us.

360
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,780
We can change the wallpaper,

361
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,781
we can paint,

362
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,283
we can put up new curtains,

363
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,785
but the soul of this house

364
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,787
will still be those
two sweet, old people.

365
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,289
I'd be afraid to wash the dishes

366
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,791
for fear I'd turn the faucet on,

367
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,294
and instead of water coming
out, it would be Lillian's tears.

368
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,797
Oh, brother.

369
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,301
I-I-I'll put
a purifier in.

370
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,806
All houses have ghosts.

371
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,808
You know, memories of people
who lived there before.

372
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,726
Now, the only way you
can get rid of them

373
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:40,229
is to-to start making
your own memories,

374
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,730
and the only way we can do that

375
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,734
is if we move in here
and start living here.

376
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,736
Mm...

377
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:48,737
maybe you're right.

378
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,240
Yeah.

379
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,742
I guess I've been overreacting.

380
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:54,743
Oh, that's okay.

381
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,245
(sighs)

382
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,747
What do you say we carry
on this conversation naked?

383
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:05,170
Do you think I could ever
make love in this house?

384
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,344
Afternoon, everybody.

385
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,712
EVERYONE: Norm!

386
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,681
Hey, Mr. Peterson, how's life?

387
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,682
Oh, the plot's okay, Woody,

388
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,934
but it kind of falls apart at the end.

389
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,303
Where's Sammy and Diane?

390
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,305
They're in the office trying to unload

391
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:24,807
The Nightmare on Diane Street.

392
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,058
Well...

393
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,359
they'll just have to miss my big news.

394
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,228
Woody, I want you

395
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,530
to stop the presses on
that, uh, newsletter.

396
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,781
You'll never guess who I saw

397
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,283
in front of my office today.

398
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,651
Robert Urich.

399
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:36,785
(gasps) Okay?

400
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,621
I want to tell you
he's just as nice a guy

401
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,122
driving past at 50 miles an hour

402
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,490
as he looks on that TV screen.

403
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,126
Hey, Woody, Woody, Woody.

404
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,494
Another round. Quick, too.

405
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:46,495
Hey, how's it going in there? Oh, great.

406
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:47,379
The couple in there are crazier

407
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,747
about the house than we were.

408
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,498
You know, I have to admit,

409
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,499
I was a little ticked off

410
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,501
when Diane said she
wanted to sell the house,

411
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,504
but as it turns out, I
think we're going to make a--

412
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,505
that's
good, Woody--

413
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,007
make a nice little profit here.

414
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,010
Are you sure I can't change your mind?

415
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,511
I'm sorry.

416
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,431
That's my final decision.

417
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,106
You know, I-I-I'm
getting on in years,

418
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,109
and my hearing may not
be what it used to be,

419
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,495
but did you just queer this whole deal?

420
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,113
I had to turn them down.

421
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:21,947
Why?

422
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,748
Sam, those people

423
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,249
were bereft of soul.

424
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,751
They had no intention

425
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,202
of embracing that house.

426
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,455
Their only desire was to live there.

427
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,259
They wanted to live in
the house they just bought?

428
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,763
My God, they must've
been raised by wolves.

429
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,215
They weren't the right kind of people

430
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:42,217
to live in Bert and Lillian's house.

431
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,218
Oh, you know...

432
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,603
That's it, that's it.

433
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,605
You know, I... we have
always done things your way.

434
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,607
I have bent over backwards
to make you happy.

435
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,109
I bought the ring you wanted,

436
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,611
the china you wanted,
the-the crystal you wanted.

437
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,613
I even agreed to have
a duvet cover on my bed,

438
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,115
and I don't know what a duvet is

439
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,983
or what it's supposed to cover.

440
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,651
When are we going to do something

441
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,537
that I want to do?

442
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,038
May I remind you that we're going

443
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:05,791
to Disney World for our honeymoon?

444
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,128
Big deal. Who isn't?

445
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,299
Sam, every time I look at that place,

446
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,803
I can't help but think
about that poor, old couple,

447
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,805
shambling away from their house,

448
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,306
wishing they could spend

449
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,676
one last Christmas
there with their family.

450
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,178
Well, then why not just give them

451
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,930
one last Christmas there,
if that's what they want?

452
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,098
But rid yourself

453
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:31,066
of the guilt you feel by robbing them

454
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,818
of the last few happy
memories left them.

455
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,653
Oh, you know, that-that's
the screwiest idea

456
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,523
I've ever heard. No, Sam, he's right.

457
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,776
We-we'll-we'll call the
Millers and all their children,

458
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,277
and we'll plan a Christmas party.

459
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:44,279
Oh, Sam, it'll make
the transition easier

460
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,280
for them and for me.

461
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,282
Well, what are we supposed
to do until December?

462
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,667
Bunk out with Ma Clavin?

463
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,619
No, I mean, we'll do it now.

464
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:54,006
This year, Christmas comes next week.

465
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,874
Oh... Huh? Oh, it'll be fun.

466
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,377
Oh, gee, I hate it when
they change holidays around

467
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,879
just to make a three-day weekend.

468
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,356
Who's ready for some
delicious hot apple cider?

469
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,727
Can I have mine with ice?
It's 80 degrees outside.

470
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,396
Where's your Christmas spirit, Naomi?

471
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,064
It melted.

472
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,067
There's another present
for you there, Naomi.

473
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,819
Isn't that right, Santa?

474
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:26,705
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

475
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,207
All right, here it is, here it is.

476
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,208
There you go, kid.

477
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,626
There you are.

478
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,628
Oh, boy!

479
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,129
What do you say, Naomi?

480
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:35,497
Thank you, Santa.

481
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,882
SAM: Ah... And what do you say, Santa?

482
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,251
Yeah, Mrs. Claus is
going to pay for this.

483
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,135
Come here.

484
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:43,555
Look, look, how much longer
do we have to do this?

485
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,557
Oh, the children are loving it.

486
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,060
Yeah, well, can I at
least take this beard off?

487
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,562
No, no, no, no.

488
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,315
Now, we don't want to
spoil their illusions.

489
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,651
Don't you think the fact
that Santa's here in mid-May

490
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:59,021
sweating bullets is making 'em
a little suspicious already?

491
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,573
Uh, yes, Santa, what a great idea.

492
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,443
Why don't you lead us all
in some Christmas carols?

493
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,913
Uh, m-m-maybe somebody
else ought to do that.

494
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,783
Uh, Santa's got a little
summer cold going here.

495
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,086
Oh, well, David is the
musician of the family.

496
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,087
Well...

497
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,589
"Let it Snow" in "E" flat.

498
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,092
(plays note)

499
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,846
♪ Oh, the weather outside is frightful ♪

500
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,131
♪ But the fire is so delightful ♪

501
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,800
♪ And since there's no place to go ♪

502
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,304
♪ Let it snow, let it
snow, let it snow... ♪

503
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,189
All right, all right, look,
we-we did it, we did it.

504
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:35,107
They're singing their carols.

505
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,108
We passed out the presents.

506
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,609
Now can we put out the stupid fire

507
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,478
and-and get the Millers
out of here, please?

508
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,780
Oh, but, Sam, we haven't
roasted the chestnuts yet.

509
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,284
Oh, guess again, sweetheart.

510
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,158
Well, you know,

511
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,993
that was great, kids, but I think

512
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:59,381
perhaps we-we ought to thank
the kind and generous friends...

513
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,668
...who've let us make
this Yuletide possible.

514
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,586
Oh, no. No, no.

515
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,088
You really don't have to.

516
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,090
No, no, not at all.

517
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,093
Now, Sam and Diane
have opened their home--

518
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,345
it is their
home now--

519
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,680
so that we can enjoy

520
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,067
one last Christmas here together.

521
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,320
Well, of course, we've
known a lot of Christmases

522
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,324
around this hearth, but for you kids,

523
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,693
this will be the last one.

524
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,611
And all they'll have

525
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:33,081
is pictures, home movies

526
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,083
and memories to fill the gap

527
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,085
through their lives.

528
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,588
Oh, I hope the memories survive.

529
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,506
Say you'll remember, children.

530
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,760
CHILDREN: We'll all remember, Grandma.

531
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,045
BERT: Yes, and-and what about Easter?

532
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,515
Will you remember the Easters, too?

533
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,517
I don't remember, Grandpa.

534
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,519
Oh, honey...

535
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:59,524
Please don't make Grandma
and Grandpa leave, lady.

536
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,892
No, go... Oh, oh,

537
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,145
th-th-they
don't have to.

538
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:05,063
Listen, why don't you
come over next week,

539
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,066
and we'll have a big Easter egg hunt

540
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,735
right here.

541
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,536
And I will make it an annual occasion.

542
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,288
CHILDREN: Yay!

543
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:14,906
No, no, no, no!

544
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,827
No, no, I am not putting
on a bunny suit for anybody!

545
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:21,046
Now, now, listen,

546
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,881
we've done everything--
more than everything--

547
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,883
anybody could possibly expect.

548
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,385
We got to draw the line somewhere here.

549
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,388
I mean, we can't arrange our
lives just for you people.

550
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,890
I mean, this is our house now.

551
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,759
Y-Y-You can't
have it anymore.

552
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,560
Please, I mean,
w-we-we need a chance

553
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,062
to start our own lives here.

554
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,064
I mean, for God's sake, we
haven't even had a chance

555
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,932
to be intimate in our own home yet.

556
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,352
What does Santa mean, Mommy?

557
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:48,357
Mommy will explain it later, dear.

558
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:50,025
Yeah, and somewhere else, Mommy.

559
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:52,327
Uh, c-come on, everybody, please, out.

560
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:53,328
(children whining)

561
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:55,330
LILLIAN: Oh, no, no, no.

562
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,833
Now, don't grumble. Santa is right.

563
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,202
He may have been a
little rude about it...

564
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,288
...but it is true.

565
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,673
We have been imposing.

566
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,711
So let's all go over to
Grandma and Grandpa's new condo

567
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,214
and have Christmas there.

568
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,598
CHILDREN: Yay!

569
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:21,106
♪ Frosty the Snowman
was a jolly, happy soul ♪

570
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,441
Bye-bye, happy holidays.

571
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,943
? With a corncob pipe and button
nose ? Yeah, bye-bye, bye-bye.

572
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,945
? And two eyes made out of
coal... ? There we go. Bye-bye.

573
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,314
Thank you. There we go.

574
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,615
What about our presents?

575
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,983
Uh, we'll ship 'em to you.

576
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:38,874
I can't believe what you just did, Sam.

577
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,742
I am not going to apologize, Diane.

578
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:44,129
Suddenly, the house is ours.

579
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,380
You mean that?

580
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,582
You claimed it for me.

581
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,718
Oh. Just stood up

582
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:53,839
and claimed it for me like
some animal out of the wild.

583
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,008
Oh, Sam...

584
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,312
you're so sexy when you're territorial.

585
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,180
So, uh...

586
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,148
anything special you want

587
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,016
from Santa this year, little girl?

588
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,936
Oh, Santa...

589
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,238
Well, I think that can be arranged.

590
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,523
There you go...

591
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,524
Where is that?

592
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,526
It's in there someplace.

593
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,914
You know, Santa? Hmm?

594
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,365
I think it's time to take you up

595
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,752
on that offer to polish the floor.

596
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,036
Oh, well, uh...

597
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,038
what room would you
like to start in here?

598
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,042
Hmm... how about the dining room?

599
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,545
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

600
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,047
(Sam laughing)
