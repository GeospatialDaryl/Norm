Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:05,453
All right,              
        here you go, Cliffie.

3
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:06,655
How about       
                getting your mom

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,623
a pair of these soothing,   
    gel-filled insoles,

5
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,358
<i>and</i> odor eliminators.

6
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:13,461
It's only her birthday,         
it's not Christmas.

7
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,830
How about one of these
          Lucite snack trays

8
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,832
that plays the theme
            from <i>Cats?</i>

9
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,302
Yeah, Valentine's Day, 1963.

10
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:23,038
Back then                       
it played "Exodus."

11
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:24,705
Hummingbird feeder?

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,525
Come on, you guys               
are just being silly            
now, right?

13
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,827
Well, then, Cliff,
              I'm afraid

14
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,330
you're going to spend   
        a little more than $1.99
        for your mom's gift.

15
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,798
Yeah, you're right, Normie.

16
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,300
You only turn 70 once.

17
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,236
Speaking as a mom,

18
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,671
you know, when        
          my kids give me gifts,

19
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,572
the ones that always
            mean the most       
            to me are the ones

20
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,941
they make themselves.

21
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:46,611
For instance, look
              at this little    
              key chain here.

22
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,680
Anthony made this for me the  
first year he went away to camp.

23
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,117
I carried it with me
            ever since.

24
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,835
I think it might be
             the most precious  
             thing I own.

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,404
Well, I'll give you             
three bucks for it.

26
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,473
Done.

43
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:11,495
Sam, you're working a big party 
the 26th at Mr. Gaines'.

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,697
Another big party...

45
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,100
How come you always     
        get roped into running  
        these things?

46
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,167
I'm not running this.

47
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,501
I'm just delivering             
the message.

48
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:19,254
Yes, I will be attending    
        the party,

49
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,522
but as an honored guest.

50
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:23,224
An honored guest who happens to 
show up a couple of hours early

51
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,326
and leave a couple hours late.

52
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:27,295
And I will do as                
any other good guest will:

53
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:31,032
help clean up,                  
and maybe park a few cars.

54
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,134
So what's the shindig   
        for this time?

55
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,103
Oh, it's one of those

00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:45,213
Gee, I've never         
     been to one of those.

60
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,215
Good.

61
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,883
You're tending bar.

62
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:49,917
There's the address.

63
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,185
I'll see you at 10:00,
          Sunday morning.

64
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,222
She played right into my hands.

REBECCA:              
          If I do say so myself,

66
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,462
I do throw     
                 a lovely party.

67
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:03,815
Oh, Mr. Gaines,

68
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,316
I don't believe     
            I've been introduced

69
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,184
to the guest of honor,
          your lovely daughter.

70
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,886
Oh, Kelly would love            
to meet you.

71
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:13,725
Oh, she's busy.

72
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,360
Jack Daniels, neat.

73
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,144
SAM:                    
        Coming right up, sir.

74
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:18,546
Say, aren't you Sam Malone?

75
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,214
Didn't you used                 
to be a pitcher?

76
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:21,549
Yep, that's me.

77
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,084
Now you're doing this?

78
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,335
Well,

79
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:25,720
nothing wrong with tending bar.

80
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:26,921
It's good, honest work.

81
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,374
Uh, here's a little       
      something for you.

82
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,818
Those rich snobs, man.

83
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,954
They think they can look        
down their noses at you,

84
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,655
and then make everything better 
by slipping you a measly...

85
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,025
50 bucks?

86
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:51,012
Two white wines,                
please.

87
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,613
Yes, sir.               
     Coming right up here.

88
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,519
You know, Woody, I tell ya,

89
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:58,786
it's a long way

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,688
from pitching                   
in the major leagues

91
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,223
to slinging drinks.

92
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,426
What am I gonna do,             
you know?

93
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,978
I mean, life's dealt me         
this lousy hand.

94
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,762
I guess I'm just
                gonna have

95
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:10,081
to play it out, huh?

96
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,949
I'm sorry, sir.

97
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,384
Uh, there               
        are your drinks.

98
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:14,502
Thank you.

99
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,687
Oh, bless you.

100
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:24,328
I'm definitely                  
on to something here.

101
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,515
Excuse me,

102
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,734
bartender.

103
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:30,985
A little more champagne.

104
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:32,370
Sure.

105
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,839
Maybe I'll get  
                a tip, too, Sam.

106
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,209
Listen, this whining for
        dollars routine is mine.

107
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,314
Anyway, I'll be summering       
in D.C., God help me.

108
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,149
Dad's favoring me               
with the option of going up

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,552
on the Hill to page       
    or being a clerk.

110
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,287
So what do you think?

111
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:50,705
Oh, uh, excuse me   
            for interrupting,

112
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,039
but I'd go         
             with the clerk job.

113
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:56,177
I had a blast the summer I      
clerked at the Piggly Wiggly.

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Uh...

115
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,581
I'm sure you did,

116
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:03,951
but I was talking about
         being a legal clerk.

117
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,087
Oh, this was all    
            in the up and up.

118
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,226
Are you always this obtuse?

119
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,576
The cummerbund

120
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,079
makes my waist
                  look thick.

121
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,483
Yeah...

122
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,484
yeah, thick.

123
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,370
That's the word     
            I was searching for.

124
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:23,788
Write it on your hand.

125
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,690
You'll never forget it.

126
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,194
He's very funny.

127
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,547
Well, here's to you,            
Malone.

128
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,816
And, uh, I wish you             
lots of luck

129
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,584
on that triple bypass.

130
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:39,821
Thank you.

131
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,356
Bless your heart.

132
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,561
You having a       
             heart problem, Sam?

133
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:50,030
Yeah, it feels like there's     
something pressing on it.

134
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:52,933
Maybe like...                   
all this cash.

135
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:56,971
( <i>speaking quietly</i> )

136
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,840
Excuse me, uh, bartender.

137
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,108
Can I give you                  
a little tip?

138
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:04,378
Looking good, Sam.

139
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,612
Sure.

140
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,398
For the rest of the afternoon,

141
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:09,533
just keep your mouth shut.

142
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,152
Excuse me?

143
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:15,557
You're here to work,      
not to chitchat with the guests.

144
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,092
You think just     
             because you're rich

145
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:19,827
you can boss people
             around?

146
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,762
We've got guys like you
         back in Hanover.

147
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,331
You know what   
                we call them?

148
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:23,881
What?

149
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,966
"Sir."

150
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:31,055
But after we say it,
            we roll our eyes.

151
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,714
You know, kid, you're really  
     starting to annoy me.

152
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:41,348
I think I'm going           
to teach you some manners.

153
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:42,583
Step outside.

154
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,068
Uh, uh, I'm sorry, all right?

155
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,269
I was out of line.

156
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,737
I don't want to fight.

157
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,756
Oh, you're not as           
      stupid as you look.

158
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,558
Now I want to fight.

159
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:53,127
Whoa, whoa, what's going    
         on here, man?

160
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:56,497
This guy just said
              I wasn't as stupid
              as I look, Sam.

161
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,333
Whoa, whoa, come here.

162
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:00,801
Listen, whoa, whoa, stop.

163
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,669
I mean it. Really, listen,      
    before you go out there,

164
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,138
let me just say         
    a couple of things here.

165
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:06,173
Now I've been a bartender   
    for quite a few years

166
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,142
and I've broken up a lot
        of fights in my day.

167
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:10,010
And I'll tell you           
no matter who's involved,

168
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:12,446
whether they're rich guys       
         or poor guys,

169
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:15,082
tall guys or short guys,

170
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:17,451
fat guys, skinny guys,

171
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,320
guys with speech impediments...

172
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:21,288
What's your point?

173
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:24,559
Well, the point is, that usually
  by this point in the story,

174
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,827
the guys would forget      
    what they're angry about

175
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,529
and they'd kind of wander away.

176
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:32,150
Yeah, well, I, I, uh...

177
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:34,451
I guess this isn't              
the right time or place.

178
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,370
Yeah, you're right.

179
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:37,821
All right, there you go.

180
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,023
Very good, very good.

181
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,525
Now why don't you just go       
  back to the bar here, Woody.

182
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:44,362
Will you tell me    
            the rest of the     
            story later, Sam?

183
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:57,008
Well, maybe we'll, uh...

184
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,210
we'll meet again,           
 when your daddy isn't around.

185
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,913
I don't need him
                to protect me.

186
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:06,084
I'll meet you     
              anywhere, anytime.

187
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,353
You can find me
                 at Cheers.

188
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:13,107
I'll see you there tomorrow.

189
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,775
I'll be there with bells on.

190
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:18,613
That's just an expression.

191
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,187
Excuse me, please.

192
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:28,222
Excuse me.

193
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:29,140
Yeah?

194
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,691
Sam, I heard           
         what you've been doing.

195
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,494
Going around      
              giving everyone   
              a hard luck story,

196
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,062
so they give you
                big tips.

197
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:36,997
I find that completely
          unprofessional,

198
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:38,333
and I will not
                  condone it.

199
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,568
I'm going to dock you   
        a day's pay.

200
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,571
Did you hear that?

201
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,477
Woody,

202
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:51,162
cognac

203
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,013
for all my friends.

204
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,615
We're celebrating           
     this year's recipient

205
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:55,850
of the Fisk Foundation grant.

206
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,150
NORM:     
                      All right.

207
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,302
I knew you could do it, buddy.

208
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,470
What the hell is it?

209
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,139
It's a very prestigious 
        and lucrative fellowship

210
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,475
that will enable me, finally,  
     after all these years,

211
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,576
to complete my treatise.

212

"Man's need to work,

and achieve."

214
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,867
Yeah, must feel                 
pretty good.

215
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,868
Oh, you bet.

216
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:16,670
If I can cop one more fat grant,
        it's loaf city.

217
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,710
Ah.

218
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,379
The only thing missing now      
is a fine cigar.

219
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,081
Well, allow me.

220
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,850
Carla, three of your  
          finest Tampas, please.

221
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:31,452
You got it, gentlemen.

222
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,588
Look at these beauties.

223
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:35,089
That'll be 45 cents.

224
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:42,446
Carla, we asked for a cigar,    
not this flammable bratwurst.

225
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,384
Come on, Fras, these
            are pretty tasty.

226
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,968
Yeah, and they                  
outlast the others

227
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:50,571
by what, a good,                
eight or nine hours.

228
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,207
Cliffie, make a smoke 
          ring go around my head
          the way you do.

229
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,742
Uh-huh.

230
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,616
Okay, Boyd, I'm here.

231
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:05,052
Yeah, so am I.

232
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:08,055
Course, I'm always here,    
      so it's no big deal.

233
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,192
You know, I wouldn't feel right 
     beating you senseless,

234
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,161
unless I warn you in advance,

235
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:16,731
I was on the boxing team    
         at Princeton.

236
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,066
Yeah? Well, while you're
        beating me senseless,

237
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,434
keep this in mind:

238
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:24,772
I was first alternate   
        on the Hanover High     
        Boxing Squad.

239
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:27,007
What is that supposed           
to mean?

240
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,076
It means if anybody
             got sick or hurt,  
             I'd be the one...

241
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,978
No!

242
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,949
I mean, is that supposed        
to make you a tough guy?

243
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:37,618
Tough enough.

244
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,388
Yeah, well, proof           
    is in the pudding.

245
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,939
All right, that does it.

246
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:44,058
Nobody says that to me.

247
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,712
Who wants to see a rich boy   
     get his butt whupped?

I can't leave here.

Look, if you're gonna fight,  
     go fight in the back.

But remember, you gotta

happens once in your life.

Calm down, Woody.

270

Isn't it enough that you left   
             little bits of face

271
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,069

how can you get him, man?

was coming here

to fight

Nash did this.

a ridiculous temper.

If there's anything I can do,  
 please, don't hesitate to ask.

295

Are your hands just 
            naturally this soft,

296
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,581
or you use          
            a special lotion?

297
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,500
Lotion, but you can't           
buy it in the States.

298
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,201
Smells good, too.

299
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,804
No, it's fragrance free.

300
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,338
You smell my hair.

301
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,842
I rinse it in an essence        
of Belgian wild flowers.

check and send you a case.

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,387
I feel just terrible            
about what Nash did.

305
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:29,790
It'd be a shame if you got      
a scar on that cute face.

306
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,275
I'll be okay.

307
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,344
Okay. Bye.

308
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,045
Bye.

309
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:39,883
Now, how could I get      
         that Nash guy?

310
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:40,918
Woody?

311
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,054
Woody, I think it's
                kind of obvious,

312
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,522
if you know what I mean.

313
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,125
Beat up his girlfriend?

314
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:55,665
I don't think you could.

315
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,851
Whoa.

316
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,486
Come on.

317
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,754
Now think with 
                 me here. Think.

318
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,155
Now, have you met   
            anybody recently,

319
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,724
kind of cute, you know?

320
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:07,227
Somebody who smells good
      and has hair down to here?

321
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:09,830
I'm interested in what          
you're saying, Sam,

322
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,465
but I just had a thought.

323
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,902
If I went out with that girl,   
I could make Nash real jealous.

324
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:18,105
( <i>all chanting</i> ):           
     Woody! Woody! Woody...

325
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,991
I'm back!           
        Woody! Woody! Woody...

326
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:24,395
This has been a fabulous day.

327
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,298
As I walked through the halls  
        of headquarters,

328
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,032
I received nothing but kudos

329
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,201
for my fantastic party     
        yesterday.

330
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,437
Mr. Gaines said         
    I displayed leadership,

331
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,873
imagination and class.

332
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:38,476
I am it.

333
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,811
That's great, Miss Howe.

334
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:44,014
Listen, do you think it'd be  
  okay if I took an hour off?

335
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,549
Of course, Woody,               
take two.

336
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,850
You deserve it.

337
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,085
Oh, great.

338
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:50,154
I'm going to go ask your boss  
         for permission

339
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:51,289
to date his daughter, okay?

340
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,089
Okay.

341
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:55,442
No!

342
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:05,469
And so, Mr. Gaines,

343
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,537
please allow me to stress again,

344
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,506
in the strongest way possible,

345
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,408
that my being here          
    in no way reflects

346
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:13,043
upon Miss Rebecca Howe

347
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,014
or her chance for advancement  
      in your corporation.

348
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,917
I'll take that under advisement.

349
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,819
Now, if you'll please get on  
      with your business?

350
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,370
Yes, sir.

351
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,305
My business is          
    that I'd like permission

352
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,275
to date your daughter Kelly.

353
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,576
I think you'll find

354
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,929
that I'm generous, hardworking,

355
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,531
friendly, cheerful, and honest.

356
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:37,851
Oh, yeah, and I'm funny, too.

357
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,621
Well presented, young man.

358
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:43,123
And a charming, old-fashioned  
    gesture, besides.

359
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,357
Ready to hit
              the links, Walter?

360
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:46,226
In a minute, Nash.

361
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,394
Anyway, as you can see,

362
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,563
your visit has been
             in vain, Mr. Boyd.

363
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,966
My daughter Kelly has been      
     dating young Nash here

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,833
for some years now.

365
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:53,934
Well, Boyd,

366
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,335
how's that chin healing?

367
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:58,155
Never mind my chin,       
        how's your ring?

368
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,863
Nash, it seems Mr. Boyd here    
has his eye on Kelly.

369
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:08,432
Oh, what a coincidence.

370
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:11,468
Only yesterday,         
he had his eye on my Topsiders.

371
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,103
Come on, son.

372
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,371
We're on the tee                
in ten minutes.

373
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,073
That sounds good,

374
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,275
but I have to warn you,         
I've never played before.

375
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,314
He's talking to me, Gomer.

376
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,350
You'll show yourself out?

377
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,392
Well, you better
                get going, Boyd.

378
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,527
You're going to be late
                for that bus.

379
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,629
A lot you know.

380
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:42,400
It doesn't come around for      
      another 15 minutes.

381
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,768
MR. GAINES:
                     Nash?

382
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:47,104
Let's do it!

383
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,973
I'll see you    
                later, Kelly.

384
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,842
Got to go let your dad
          beat me at golf again.

385
00:16:56,347 --> 00:17:00,484
Well, I better be going, too.

386
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,605
Wait a minute.

387
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,057
I heard your dad's answer

388
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,191
and I heard Nash's answer,

389
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,527
but I still haven't heard       
        your answer yet.

390
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,264
Oh, gosh, Woody, I couldn't.

391
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,633
I understand.

392
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:21,204
Wait a minute.

393
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,059
Why not?

394
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,994
I'm not Nash's property,

395
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:30,197
and I just hate it when he      
always assumes that I am.

396
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:33,133
Well, beans, this'll show him!

397
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:36,270
Aw, that's great.           
    That is terrific.

398
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:37,571
All right.

399
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,740
I'll pick you up tomorrow       
         at 8:00, okay?

400
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,793
Now, I promise you you're going 
to have the best time possible.

401
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:44,528
You may think from looking      
             at me,

402
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:47,063
that I'm an unsophisticated guy 
who doesn't know his way around,

403
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,349
but you're going        
    to find out I do, okay?

404
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:50,700
I'll see ya.

405
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:57,557
Woody?

406
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:59,477
Yes?

407
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,879
Do you know you're in a closet?

408
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,951
Yeah, but I thought it might be 
    more sophisticated

409
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,518
just to lay low         
    and then sneak out

410
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,421
after everyone went to bed.

411
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,643
Good night.

412
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,645
Good night.

413
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,871
Sam, has Woody come back    
    from his date yet?

414
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,071
Uh-uh.

415
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,875
I changed his schedule around so
he can all of his evenings off

416
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,644
so he can continue to date      
that lovely young woman.

417
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,613
Wait a minute, now you
            want him to date?

418
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,214
I mean, what happened      
         to the Attack

419
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,750
of the Screaming Boss Lady      
        from Hell?

420
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,853
Now I will admit        
     that I didn't want him

421
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,088
to ask her out originally,      
      but let's face it--

422
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,323
he's on a date with her.

423
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,459
And the more they date,         
the more of a chance

424
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,461
he has to become                
the boss's son-in-law.

425
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,330
And boss's sons-in-law become  
              VP's

426
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,466
and in the corporate world,   
        it always helps

427
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,100
to have a VP          
        in your corner.

428
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,735
That's disgusting.

429
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,872
Sam, I don't make up the rules.

430
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:03,340
I just follow them.

431
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:09,713
Thanks again for a wonderful    
evening, Woody.

432
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,815
You introduced me               
to a whole new world.

433
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,583
Yeah, it's hard to
         believe a girl like you

434
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:16,653
has never been to   
            a monster truck and 
            tractor pull before.

435
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,393
Oh, Woody!        
              On the first date!

436
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,361
How you going   
             to top that, buddy?

437
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,012
Well, there's no need      
        to top it.

438
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:27,714
It's a one-shot deal.

439
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,798
Wh-What do you mean?      
            What...?

440
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,800
I mean, the only reason     
      she went out with me

441
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,536
was to make a point       
      with her boyfriend.

442
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,321
Wait, wait, wait,               
how do you know that?

443
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,322
'Cause she told me.

444
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:36,556
I mean, it only seems fair.

445
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,258
The only reason         
      I went out with her

446
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,693
was to get revenge          
    at her boyfriend.

447
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,394
At least that's what I told her.

448
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:42,830
NORM: 
                          Woody,

449
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:44,497
that is beautiful.

450
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:45,565
That's the kind of honesty

451
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,600
that's going to keep you out  
          of marriage.

452
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:53,223
Kelly.

453
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,943
Your dad said          
     I might find you here.

454
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,728
Nash, I know what               
you're going to say,

455
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,264
and I don't want                
to hear it.

456
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:03,283
I'm tired of being
        treated like chattel.

457
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:06,186
Excuse me, I think that's       
    pronounced cattle.

458
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,895
You know, when I heard          
what you were up to,            
I got really mad.

459
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,597
Then I, well, I realized,       
you couldn't possibly

460
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:19,766
be doing this                   
for your own enjoyment,

461
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,836
so you must be doing it         
to prove a point to me.

462
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,239
And I have to say,              
point well taken.

463
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:28,175
This has been a humbling        
experience for me.

464
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,376
Nothing personal.

465
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:33,813
That's okay, I didn't      
         understand it.

466
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:38,301
Anyway, from now on,            
new Nash.

467
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:41,271
Just hope you'll give me        
another chance.

468
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:44,574
Well, okay.

469
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,876
Great.

470
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,910
Hey, let's go.

471
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,446
Maybe we can catch              
a late supper at Guiseppi's.

472
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,314
I don't know.

473
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,050
Are we finished with our date, 
             Woody?

474
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:57,387
Yeah, okay, I guess it's
          over... if you want.

475
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,694
Well, thanks again          
    for a fun evening.

476
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:04,894
Kelly?

477
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,563
What?

478
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:08,899
Nothing.

479
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,768
Do you have something you want 
      to say to me, Woody?

480
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,704
No.

481
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,939
I had a great time.

482
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,140
It was nice meeting you.

483
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:20,377
I was really happy 
             to get to know you.

484
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:23,614
I guess I did have          
    something to say to you.

485
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:28,118
So, I... guess         
     we should be leaving.

486
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,804
Yeah, I guess I should be       
     getting back to work.

487
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:32,272
Well, have fun working.

488
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:33,940
Yeah, have fun leaving.

489
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,447
Woody, come on, man.

490
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,981
Go get her.

491
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,949
I can't, Sam.

492
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:44,451
What could I possibly           
say to her?

493
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:45,819
Just say, "I like you.

494
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,387
Will you go out
                 with me again?"

495
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,988
Oh, right, just like that.

496
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,791
And she's going to dump         
her rich boyfriend

497
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,692
who she's been seeing           
for all these years,

498
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:53,960
for poor, old, nobody Woody.

499
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:55,361
I'm afraid the real world

500
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,564
doesn't work                    
like that, Sam; trust me.

501
00:21:57,598 --> 00:21:59,132
No, Woody, come on.

502
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,234
Hey, listen, just do me
            a favor: Go get her.

503
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:03,603
Now, if it doesn't work out,
            I'll buy you dinner.

504
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:05,138
If it does, you owe me.

505
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,239
Just go out there.

506
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,808
Say, "I like you, will you
          go out with me again?"

507
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,743
Come on, before it's    
        too late, go get her.

508
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:12,212
I'll give it a try, Sam.

509
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,668
Excuse me.

510
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,872
Kelly, uh...

511
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,461
I like you.

512
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,496
Will you go out with me again?

513
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,681
Sure.

514
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:32,916
Oh, great,

515
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,084
great.

516
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:35,753
Well, we can't do it tonight.

517
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,187
I've got to take Sam out.

518
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,241
Oh, no, no.

519
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,044
It's okay, we can               
go out now.

520
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:46,446
Uh, yeah, I have                
a standing reservation

521
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,381
at Pizza by the Yard.

522
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,649
Oh, wait a minute.

523
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,051
What about Nash?

524
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,003
Well, I was getting in the car 
            with him

525
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,304
when I realized...

526
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,807
Woody, I have          
    a lot more fun with you.

527
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:00,343
Ah, yeah,                       
I know what you mean.

528
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,713
I didn't have much fun          
with Nash, either.

529
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,582
Hey, Miss Howe?

530
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,002
Can I leave now?        
        Take Kelly out?

531
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:11,205
I promise I'll work       
      a double next week.

532
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,272
Oh, don't worry about it.

533
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,707
Go, go ahead.          
    Have a good time.

534
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:15,875
And if you want to stay out   
  real late and get married,

535
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,477
then come in anytime tomorrow.

536
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,362
You're the greatest, Miss Howe.

537
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,564
WOODY:                          
Okay, let's hurry.

538
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,998
If we get there by 6:00,

539
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,234
we can sit              
     at the Pac-Man table.

540
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:25,802
What's a Pac-Man?

541
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:28,371
Oh, Kelly, I have  
        so much to teach you.
