Every since Reagan          
     left the White House,

this country has gone      
     to heck in a handcart.

Here we go.

00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,015
Ha-ha.

00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,650
Damn.

9
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,753
All right, Cliff, seeing    
  as how I'm your best friend,

10
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,188
I guess you better tell me      
      what the problem is.

11
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,925
Ah, you're only asking me   
    'cause you lost the toss.

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,195
No, he's only your best friend 
because he lost the toss.

13

Eh, fine, here,
             go ahead and laugh.

14
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:34,499
Yeah, go ahead
                      and laugh.

15
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,468
We'll see how funny
             you think this is.

00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:39,270

17
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:40,872
Oh, as you you may
                have guessed,

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,143
this is a hybrid cross between
          a rutabaga and a beet.

19
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,778
What are we calling it?

20
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,880
Beetabaga.

21
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,751
Cliffie, I don't want to        
poke holes in this thing,

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,822
or even touch it,               
actually,

23
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,291
but really, I mean,             
how useful do you think

24
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:00,959
this is going to be?

25
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,110
Are you kidding, Norm?

26
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:03,611
This is a perfect   
                    vegetable

27
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,647
for kids who hate   
    rutabagas but love beets.

28
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:09,184
Oh, and there must be, what,    
dozens of those, right?

29
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,353

31
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:14,789
That's why those faceless   
    bureaucrats in Washington

32
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,691
are trying to steal it
                away from me.

33
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,093
Which reminds me.

34
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,962
Uh, I got an affidavit here   
    I'd like you all to sign

35
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,564

00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:24,466
is the inventor         
    of the beetabaga.

                     Yeah?

39
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:30,972
Remember when, uh,              
you asked me to tell you

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,041
if you were going off           
the deep end?

41
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,708
Yeah.

42

Well, don't come up too fast,

Well, you're way off, Sam.

What's the occasion?

Oh, well, uh, the corporation's

Oh, so in case
              you bump in to him

Yeah, he makes me               
so nervous.

Oh, hi, Mr. Gaines.

Woody...

92
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,905
now that            
you're dating my daughter,

93
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,774
I suppose               
    we should take some time

94
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,542
to be a little more friendly.

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,944
Therefore,

to Kelly's

00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,614
Oh, thanks,           
      but you didn't have

98
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,016
to come all the way down here  
     and tell me in person.

99
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,886
Well, I keep thinking if we   
spend more time together,

100
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,654
see each other face to face,

101
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:37,391

      is for my daughter.

102

Nope.

 to here with this corporation.

Hey, everybody,

00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,511
here comes
              the broken record.

107
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,415
I get invited to my first       
      power lunch meeting

108
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,116
and nobody even notices me.

109
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:04,285
As usual, I am just ignored.

110
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:07,088
But I finally figured out why.

111
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,874
I am just too   
              darned attractive.

112
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:13,962
Guys really hate that.

113
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,763
You know, the problem   
            is that everybody

114
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:18,532
just sees me            
        as a sex kitten.

115
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,917
I hate that.

116
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:23,754
I think I need to find          
a new role model.

117
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:26,091
If only I knew one              
successful career woman

118
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,861
with an image that invites      
no sexual appeal whatsoever.

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,907
Which is it?

123
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:43,674
The radiant

124
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,176
glow of impending motherhood,

125
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:46,677
or the 20 pounds of water

in my fingers and ankles?

I love the way you dress.

129
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,539
Do you
                      think that

130
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:01,976
um, you could help me develop  
a more business-like appearance?

131
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,711
I'd love to, Rebecca.

132
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,947
And may I say          
it's about time you asked.

133
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,299
There are two

134
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,650
approaches a woman can take

135
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,535
in turning her look       
    to her advantage.

136
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:14,238
The first is to play upon       
     the male sexual drive

137
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,607
and turn yourself           
into an object of desire.

138
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,759
I have opted for the second.

139
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:19,493
What's that?

140
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:22,763
Scaring them stupid.

141
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:25,099
I like it.

142
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,368
So, Woods, what did Mr. Big
     want to talk to you about?

143
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,103
He still sweating you out 
      about seeing his daughter?

144
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,189
I bet he offered you      
        a couple of thou

145
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,524
to keep your mitts off     
the airhead to the throne.

                    Don't you   
                do it, Woody.

Money is no substitute for
      the love of a good woman.

148
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,849
Now real estate, especially
            in today's market...

149
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,917
No, no, no.           
You guys are way off base.

150
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,753
I didn't think Mr. Gaines       
        liked me either,

151
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,389
but he just invited me     
to Kelly's birthday party.

152
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:49,457
NORM:   
                      Ooh, well,
                that's great.

153
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:50,908
Well, you know, you're          
going to have

154
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,176
to get her a present, Wood.

155
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,012
I know, Carla.
          I'm prepared for this.

156
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,280
And I'm not just giving
                her any present,

157
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,982
but the gift
            that makes us all

158
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,784
a little bit happier    
            to be alive.

159
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,553
The gift of laughter.

160
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,989
( <i>chuckling</i> )

161
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,524
How, uh,
                how so, Wood?

162
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:11,129
I'm giving her <i>The Really Big</i>  
      <i>Book of Dutch Humor.</i>

163
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:12,563
( <i>laughing</i> )

164
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:15,332
See, it works.

165
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,135
Woody, you know,                
everybody at the party

166
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,203
is going to be richer than God.

167
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,040
If you walk in there and        
show them a stupid book

168
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,641
full of tulip jokes,

169
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,410
they're going to laugh          
in your face.

170
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,180
That's kind of 
                the idea, Carla.

171
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,353
Woody, I think Kelly might      
be used to gifts

172
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,922
a little bit more expensive.

173
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,074
Well, then why did          
     the father invite me?

174
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,076
He knows I can't        
     afford anything ritzy.

175
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:44,078
Well, maybe that's              
his plan, Woody.

176
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:47,715
Maybe he wants to humiliate you 
in front of Kelly's friends,

177
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:50,718
so she'll be too embarrassed    
to date you anymore.

178
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,788
Maybe I won't even go.

179
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:56,791
Maybe I'll just stay home this
weekend and work on my hair.

180
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,526
Sam?

181
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,762
Yeah.

182
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,397
I could help you out.

183
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:10,371
You know, you got a wave there 
  that's just going to waste.

184
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:11,772
Say, Woody, Woody.

185
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,975
Before Mr. Jacques
            combs you out...

186
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:16,894
...could you come here?

187
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,534
Woody, you're giving up     
          too easily.

188
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,270
You see, I'm sure you have
          plenty to offer Kelly.

189
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:27,705
Like what?

190
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,506
Well, how 'bout
          a gift from the heart?

191
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,208
Something which                 
no rich man can obtain,

192
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:33,744
upon which no price
                     can be set.

193
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,580
Great idea, Dr. Crane.

194
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,216
I can't tell you actually   
        what to do of course,

195
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,718
but I can relate a story
        from my own experience.

196
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:44,288
I remember when I was   
      courting a certain beauty,

197
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,390
I wrote her a poem.

198
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,759
Of course, it was no great
            piece of literature,

199
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,761
but it did express
        my feelings honestly.

200
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,130
I recall reciting the last
             lines while we were

201
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:56,033
sitting in front of the fire,   
            basking in our love.

202
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:59,103
"Your lips are the flame    
        that consumes me

203
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,538
and the candle
            that lights my way."

204
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:02,639
Frasier, love.

205
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:03,907
Yes, dearest?

206
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,277
I've never heard that           
drivel before in my life.

207
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:15,619
I wonder whose lips those were.

208
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:24,512
( <i>indistinct conversations</i> )

209
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:31,819
Wow, Kelly,
            that's beautiful.

210
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,555
Come on, Uncle Val, I know you. 
        What's the gag?

211
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:35,673
Look inside.

212
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,161
Yeah, a new Mercedes!

213
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:43,230
Thank you.

214
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,649
Well, that looks
                like that's it.

215
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,084
What say we all go outside

216
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,520
and have a look         
  at some of Kelly's new cars?

217
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:53,524
Wait, everybody.

218
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,893
Woody hasn't given me           
his present yet.

219
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:56,994
Oh.

220
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:58,796
That's right, Kelly.

221
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,032
Uh, could you          
     come stand over here?

222
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,234
I'd like to sing you

223
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,935
a little song  
                I wrote for you.

224
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,274
Now I should tell 
             you right up front,

225
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,510
that I'm not really     
          a professional singer.

226
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,345
I'm more of a vocal stylist.

227
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,813
The song, Woody.

228
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,697
Oh, right.

229
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:28,392
( <i>plays sweetly</i> )

230

¶ Kelly, my darling,       
     you are my sunshine ¶

         I feel fine ¶

( <i>song ends</i> )

244
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,681
Oh, Woody, that was beautiful.

245
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:41,782
You really liked it?

246
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,650
Oh, I liked it         
      more than anything.

247
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,484
Thanks.

248
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,854
So, where's my gift?

249
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:59,500
Woody, I think you ought    
          to lay off.

250
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,469
How many have you had?

251
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:04,222
Eleven.

252
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,290
11 beers?

253
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,741
11 sips.

254
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,195
Well, that's...

255
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:13,647
that's plenty, Woody.

256
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,183
You know, booze is no way   
        to handle any problems.

257
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:19,286
I just can't get over that Kelly
     made a fool out of me

258
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:20,654
in front of all         
         those people.

259
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:22,122
So you just left, huh?

260
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,674
What else could I do?

261
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,711
I told her my present           
was out front and ran off.

262
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,546
Don't worry about it, Wood.

263
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,515
It happens to all of us.

264
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,866
Really?

265
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,935
Did Mrs. Peterson ever     
     make a fool out of you

266
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,470
in front of other people?

267
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:40,007
Yeah, there was that time she  
pulled the old "I do" gag.

268
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:47,081
I just never expected      
        this from Kelly.

269
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,816
I'm really mad at her.

270
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,118
She's just a rich...

271
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:52,820
a rich...

272
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:55,339
I'd like to call her      
         a nasty name,

273
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:59,143
but I can't think of anything  
     that rhymes with rich.

274
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,112
You know, Woody, you're better 
        off dumping her.

275
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,148
Rich people stink.

276
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,916
I hate them.

277
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,684
I hate their soft shoes...

278
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:10,988
the way they're too relaxed   
        to sweat.

279
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,824
You know what I hate most about 
          rich people?

280
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,160
I'm not one of them.

281
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,330
Yeah, Carla, you sweat
        like a longshoreman.

282
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,740
Woody, I think you ought        
to give her a second chance.

283
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,909
I mean, Kelly doesn't know      
what she's doing here.

284
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,344
She was born rich.

285
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,746
All her school friends
                    are rich.

286
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:37,798
You know, maybe she just        
can't imagine someone

287
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,267
who can't afford                
something expensive.

288
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:41,868
Did you explain it to her?

289
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,405
What's the use?         
     I don't care anymore.

290
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:45,739
Don't be bitter.

291
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,375
I'm not bitter, Sam.

292
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,943
I'm just consumed           
    by a gnawing hate

293
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:51,562
that's eating away at my gut

294
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:53,931
until I can taste the bile      
          in my mouth.

295
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,186
Well, I guess I am a little   
            bitter.

296
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,621
Either that or I'm coming down 
        with something.

297
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:04,207
Does anybody have a Tic Tac?

298
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:12,733
( <i>knocking</i> )

299
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:15,970
Where's Rebecca?

300
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:17,070
In changing.

301
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,806
I'm helping her         
    remake her image.

302
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,508
We're planning to crash
                 the power lunch

00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,075
going on right now
                  at Melville's,

304
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,511
to show those executives

305
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:25,913
what a real, no-nonsense    
    businesswoman looks like.

306
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,280
What does she look like?

307
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,383
Miss Howe?

308
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:35,956
Oh, a man.

309
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,492
Carla, stop 
                interrupting.

310
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:42,129
Lilith is trying to teach me how
to be a hard-ass businesswoman.

311
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:43,831
The pretzel man wants      
          to see you.

312
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,265
You talk to him.

313
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,634
He scares me.

314
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,837
You look wonderful, Rebecca.
                    Thank you.

315
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,372
Can you breathe in that thing?

316
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,107
I'm a little constricted.

317
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,808
Perhaps it's the tight collar.

318
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:58,462
Or the ace bandage strapped   
    around my breasts.

319
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:01,214
Well, they interfered with      
    the line of your jacket.

320
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,567
What do you think, Carla?

321
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,969
Well, turn around.

322
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,905
Bind her butt, too.

323
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:13,494
Are you ready

324
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,362
to sock it              
to the old boy's network?

325
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,163
I am!

326
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,597
Too much inflection.

327
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:18,265
I am.

328
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,283
I am proud of you.

329
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,993
Geez, two Liliths.

330
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,595
This is like a nightmare    
          I had once.

331
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:32,963
You, too?

332
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,502
Well, that cuts it.

333
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,770
The whole world's against me.

334
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,738
What's the problem, Cliffie?

335
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,441
Oh, those boneheads down    
         at McDonald's

336
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,242
refuse to consider the obvious 
        commercial value

337
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,763
of Mcbeetabaga burgers.

338
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,199
For God's sake, are you
            still going on about

339
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:53,934
your stupid vegetable?

340
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:55,603
It's not my vegetable, Norm.

341
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,903
It belongs to the whole world.

342
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:59,440
Aren't you vegetable enough   
         for the world?

343
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:00,624
Now you are going               
to be doubting

344
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,293
on the other side               
of your mouth pretty soon.

345
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,628
You know, I went
                home last night

346
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,447
and fooled around in            
the kitchen a little bit,

347
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,848
and I came up with some         
mouthwatering morsels here.

348
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,817
Come on, who's going      
        to be the first

349
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,186
to try some of these goodies?

350
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,520
We have beetabaga brittle,

351
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:16,390
beetabaga burritos and that     
little taste of Cairo,

352
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,392
beetabaga fajita in a pita.

353
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,530
How about a beetabaga   
                    barf bag?

354
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,052
I'd like to try one.      
             May I?

355
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,572
Sure, you certainly may.

356
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,440
You certainly may.

357
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:35,108
A man with a sense of adventure.

358
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,711
Here you go, sir.

359
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:40,914
Mm.

360
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,016
Oh, this is delicious.

361
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,286
Yeah, yeah?                     
Not too chalky?

362
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:46,553
No,

363
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,955
I really like the unusual   
                     aftertaste.

364
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:51,625
Yeah, that'll stay with         
you for a couple of days.

365
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,594
Now listen up down there.

366
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,796
This fine gentleman can         
teach you something.

367
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,164
You know, I plan    
              to tell the people

368
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,299
back where
             I work about these.

369
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,633
Oh, hey, hear that?

370
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,368
And I should know   
    something on the subject,

371
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:04,070
as I not only have a degree
                 in agriculture,

372
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,072
but I'm also a graduate
             of the Cordon Bleu.

373
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,275
The man is an expert.

374
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,043
I'm also an astronaut.

375
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,112
Wow.

376
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,683
Next week I'm going to be   
             the Queen of Spain.

377
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:26,259
Hey, uh, Fras, could you use    
another patient?

378
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,178
Oh, Cliff, you're harmless.

379
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,865
Yeah, there's only              
one thing left to do.

380
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,367
I'll just take this             
to the public.

381
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:37,838
Beetabaga fajita on a pita?

382
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,273
<i>No habla espanol, senor.</i>

383
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,548
Woody, are you okay?

384
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:50,083
I was afraid something awful    
had happened to you.

385
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,685
Yeah, well, maybe it did.

386
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:54,054
I kept waiting for you to come 
    back to the party,

387
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:56,256
and at first I just figured   
         you'd gone out

388
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,859
on to the front lawn and got  
     lost, like last week.

389
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,027
But now I know something's      
             wrong.

390
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,462
I'll tell you what's wrong.

391
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,364
I don't have a gift for you.

392
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,799
So why don't you just leave?

393
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,635
Okay, Woody, if that's     
         what you want.

394
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:11,454
No, wait, Kelly.

395
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:15,058
It's not what I want, but you   
have to understand something.

396
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,194
I'm just a poor working guy.

397
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,997
Could we go someplace and talk?

398
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,099
I can't leave now.

399
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,133
Why not?

400
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,902
I have a job.

401
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,905
I know, I think                 
that's so cute.

402
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,606
I don't work to be cute.

403
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,141
I work to make money to live.

404
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,342
The cute part just happens.

405
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,245
Don't you understand?

406
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:37,615
I'm trying, Woody.

407
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,050
There are some gifts you
              can't put in a box

408
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,520
or hold in your hand.

409
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:45,022
Kelly, the song was my gift.

410
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,292
Oh, I get it, the song is       
        a riddle, right?

411
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
And if I can figure it out

412
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,828
it'll tell me where you've      
        hidden my gift.

413
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:56,099
I think we're just
                  too different.

414
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,702
I don't think we should see
             each other anymore.

415
00:18:58,769 --> 00:18:59,903
Really?

416
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,221
Really.

417
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:05,025
I guess there isn't anything  
          else to say.

418
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,749
Well, I'm sorry, man.

419
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,618
But what were you           
        supposed to do?

420
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,354
You know, run out   
         and empty your savings,

421
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,390
hock everything you own, spend
every penny you ever earned

422
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,859
just to buy her a silly 
        little piece of jewelry?

423
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,328
Sam, that's a great idea.

424
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,797
No, Woody.

425
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,832
And I always thought      
      I was the smart one.

426
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:34,154
( <i>grunting</i> )

427
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:44,497
How'd it go?

428
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:45,933
Well, not bad.

429
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,101
If I choose to accept      
          their offer,

430
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:49,669
you're looking at           
     the new vice president

431
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:52,105
in charge of          
     the Eastern Seaboard.

432
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:53,306
She's lying.

433
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,475
I'm the vice president          
of the Eastern Seaboard.

434
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,778
Now I am the Eastern Seaboard.

435
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,312
What a view!

436
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,275
( <i>playing note on piano</i> )       
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

437
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:15,529
¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

438
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,366
Hi, Kelly.

439
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,035
Happy birthday.

440
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:25,638
I thought you never wanted      
        to see me again.

441
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:28,024
Oh, that was just a joke.

442
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,394
You know my crazy Dutch humor.

443
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,265
Here.

444
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,535
Oh, Woody, you didn't have to.

445
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,674
Oh, it's a pendant.

446
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,744
It's a little opal        
      surrounded by sand.

447
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,379
Those are crushed diamonds.

448
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,750
I like it.

449
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:54,484
Where's the chain?

450
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:59,123
Well, I'll have that for you  
  in another 18 easy payments.

451
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,925
Well, let's go
                get it now.

452
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,593
We'll take my new Lamborghini.

453
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,996
It only has                     
three miles on it.

454
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,464
We can't go get it now.

455
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,999
I don't have any money.

456
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,802
Oh, we can just stop by your  
  automatic teller on the way.

457
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,321
Kelly, when I say I don't   
                 have any money,

458
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:15,689
I don't have any money.

459
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:19,193
Nothing in my shoe,
      nothing under my mattress.

460
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,360
Nothing.

461
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,262
You take all the money
                in all the world

462
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,430
and get rid of it

463
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:25,365
and that's how much
                money I have.

464
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:29,553
Wait a minute.

465
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:33,990
You can't afford this, can you?

466
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:38,728
That's why you've               
been so upset.

467
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,464
Now I understand.

468
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:45,202
It's like when Daddy wanted   
 to buy Shell Oil and couldn't.

469
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:50,924
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

470
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:54,061
You know,                       
this is really sweet,           
but I can't accept it

471
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,596
if it's going to hurt you.

472
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:58,398
Thanks, Kelly.

473
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:01,151
I feel really bad about this.

474
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:02,886
No, I'm the one.

475
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:08,224
You see, I just wanted          
to give you something

476
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:09,492
that nobody else could,

477
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,662
and I know I couldn't compete   
with your friends

478
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:15,465
when it came to expensive stuff,
so I tried that dorky song.

479
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,200
It was pretty.

480
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,002
The tune or the words?

481
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,837
The words especially.

482
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:24,074
Good, 'cause I sort       
    of ripped off the tune.

483
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:27,110
I liked it.

484
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,896
Well, gee, there is one other  
  thing I wanted to give you,

485
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:32,032
and maybe it's even       
     better than the song.

486
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,667
No one else in the world has it.

487
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,835
What's that?

488
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,605
Just...

489
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,840
I love you.

490
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:54,504
You're not going to say         
"where's my gift," are you?

491
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:58,842
Oh, Woody, you make me
                feel so ashamed.

492
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:04,247
Your gift makes all those   
        others seem so cheap.

493
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,266
Look, Kelly, you're the best    
girl in the whole world.

494
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,035
And to think that           
    for your birthday

495
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,003
I was going to get          
         you a Porsche.

496
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:19,613
Talk about shallow.

497
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,668
All you really need is to hear 
  me say that I love you, too.

498
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:30,991
Woody?

499
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:34,895
Woody?

500
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,632
I'm sorry, did you say          
something after Porsche?

501
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:46,632
