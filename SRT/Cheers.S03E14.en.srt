00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,556
THE HEART
lS A LONELY SNlPEHUNTER

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,389
- Vodka martini and a Seltzer.
- You got it.

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,792
Thank you.

4
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,832
Beer.

5
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,999
Holy coyote! What's that stink?

6
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,875
Smells like they're burning
the chef's special at Melville's.

7
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,508
Smells like they're burning the chef.

8
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,478
No. Wait, l know what that smell is.

9
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,236
- Anybody mind if l smoke?
- Not if you put the lit end in your mouth.

10
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,478
l learned how to smoke them this way,
Carla, and l'll stick with it.

11
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,870
- Boy, is somebody boiling tar in here?
- No, Sam. l'm smoking my cigar.

12
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,679
Would someone please boil some tar?

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,035
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

14
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,032
- What's new, Normie?
- Terrorists, Sam.

15
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,158
They've taken over my stomach
and they're demanding beer.

16
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,278
- lt's a world gone mad.
- What's that stench?

17
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,750
lt's my cigar, Normie.
Let me know if it bothers you.

18
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,349
- lt bothers me.
- Join the club.

19
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,116
New cologne, Sam?

20
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,590
lt's a step up.

21
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,911
Do you have any idea
how much that cigar stinks?

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,709
Are you kidding?
lt's right below my nose.

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,715
- Sammy, all set to...
- You bet, good buddy.

24
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,151
Did that gesture signify
a primitive mating ritual?

25
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,790
Actually we are going up
to the woods to spend the day fishing.

26
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,111
Fishing. How lovely.

27
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,593
You know, it's truly essential
to one's peace of mind now and then

28
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,072
to get back in tune with the rhythms of
nature and shed the mechanised world.

29
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,152
You're right.
Did you remember to bring the TV set?

30
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,630
- Yeah. l got a portable VCR, Sam.
- Good.

31
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,749
- l rented ''Porky's ll'' and ''Splash''.
- All right.

32
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,119
- You have a fish tracking device, too?
- That wouldn't be sportsmanlike.

33
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,748
We prefer depth charges.

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,233
- So, you guys are going fishing?
- Yeah, go pull some lip.

35
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,712
- You got it.
- Boy, l love fishing.

36
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,714
- A spur-of-the-moment decision?
- No, we've planned this.

37
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,836
- Check this lake.
- Looks good.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,630
- l guess you forgot to tell me.
- l don't know. l don't remember.

39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,756
Well, l do. You didn't.

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,230
Maybe you mentioned it
to another best friend

41
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
who lives
for doing manly things in the wild.

42
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,071
You want to go fishing with us?

43
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,233
l don't want to infringe
on you and Norm's good time.

44
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,392
You're going to have to
if you want come along.

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,676
Come on, let's go fishing.

46
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,516
- l'd better check my social calendar.
- That's the wall of the men's room.

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,789
- l wouldn't mind doing a little fishing.
- Me neither. You got room?

48
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,235
What the hell? Let's make it a party.

49
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,358
- l thought it was just going to be us.
- Come on, Cliff.

50
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,072
l'm just surprised you are so eager to go
someplace you're obviously not wanted.

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,118
There's some gear
in the back there, guys.

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,593
- Hello, Diane.
- Hi, Frasier.

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920
Your lips are troubled.

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,311
No wonder.
Look at the hell he puts them through.

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,514
Well, this has been a bad day.
Bad week. Bad month.

56
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,514
This time of the year is murder
on the psychiatric profession.

57
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,910
Just sit down and relax.

58
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,117
- Scotch, Sam.
- You have problems there, Frase?

59
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,159
All the neuroses l face every day
have a negative effect on me.

60
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,629
Why don't you do what l did?

61
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,634
Throw her clothes in the hallway
and lock the door.

62
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,791
Diane is my salvation. lt's my patients
that have caused this distress.

63
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,115
Miserable people pouring out
their litany of depression and anxiety.

64
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,909
The only way my situation
could be worse is if l listened to them.

65
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,595
Even at a time like this,
his humour survived.

66
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,275
l know exactly what you're saying, Doc.
l do.

67
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,513
After years behind this bar,
l've learned how to make people happy.

68
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,432
How's that?

69
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,956
Whatever problem they got,
l point out the bigger problem.

70
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,554
Like in your case, you're going bald.

71
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,555
l am? Now l'm depressed
and losing my hair.

72
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,999
That's nothing. lt's child's play compared
to that big mole you got on your neck.

73
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,116
- Please, no more. l'm cheered up.
- Any time, Doc.

74
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,195
All right, Sammy. Just one quick stop
to change clothes and we'll be all set.

75
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,318
Okey-dokey.
Hope things look up for you, Frasier.

76
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,119
- Going fishing, are you?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,628
How idyllic. Away from the noise,
the crime, the borderline psychotics.

78
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,553
Actually, Cliffie's coming along, too.

79
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,875
l was just kidding, Cliff.
OK, Coach. Good night.

80
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,474
See you guys. Be back later.

81
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,757
Sam, it looks like
you might have room for one more.

82
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,199
lsn't there someone else you'd like to
invite? A very depressed gentleman?

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,997
The bass are about this big there.
Want to go get one?

84
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,316
l've never been fishing
but it might be just what l need.

85
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,711
- lf none of you mind, count me in.
- Goody.

86
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,790
Watch out, fish. Here l come.

87
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,789
You want to come along?
We're running a little low on bait.

88
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,110
Cut it out, you kidder.

89
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,515
Take care of my fella.
He's a tenderfoot.

90
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,395
- How come you're not going?
- l don't like to smell them.

91
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,472
- Yeah, fish stink.
- No, the guys.

92
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,714
Out in that sun all day, stuck in the muck.
Who needs it?

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,918
- Want to play Red Sox trivia?
- Sure. Fire away.

94
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,755
Good. l got some real tough ones
for you this time. Ready?

95
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,629
Number one. What over 300 hitter was
called...

96
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,553
- Jimmy Foxx.
- Right.

97
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,917
That was just an easy warm-up.
Now we're going to start.

98
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,638
Shoot.

99
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,553
- What Red Sox shortstop...
- Don Buddin.

100
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,310
- An outfielder...
- Conigliaro.

101
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,029
Boy, you are good. Try me now.

102
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,157
- Who was the only man to pinch hit...
- Lu Clinton.

103
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,871
- You sure you want to go on?
- lt's not as much fun as it used to be.

104
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,990
- Think we've played together too long?
- Was the next answer Frank Malzone?

105
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,276
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,953
- Looks like you had a good time.
- Great time, Diane. Great time.

107
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,076
l'm so glad.

108
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,076
Where's Frasier?

109
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,916
Did l say something amusing?

110
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,317
You're going to get a giggle out of this.
Frasier's still up in the woods.

111
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,311
He's snipe hunting.

112
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,432
You sent him on a snipe hunt. l love it.

113
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,068
What's a snipe hunt?

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,916
lt's an age-old custom wherein we take
an uninitiated hunter like Dr Crane,

115
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,198
put him in a clearing with a gunnysack
and we beat out the snipe to him.

116
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,433
Rather an elemental sport
but l don't see the humour in it.

117
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,639
The humour is that while the guy's
out there with a gunnysack,

118
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,270
we have dinner in a restaurant
and come here for some beers.

119
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,149
There's no such thing as a snipe, so
there's no reason for us to hang around.

120
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,393
But since the bagger doesn't know that,
he stays and we leave.

121
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,320
l swear to you, this is really funny.

122
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,270
You should have seen your buddy.
He's a real sport.

123
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,193
He was practising the bagger's position.

124
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,113
Sammy made up this terrific snipe call.

125
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,918
- Actually somebody else made that up.
- You could hear him from miles.

126
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,196
ln other words,
you abandoned Frasier in the woods.

127
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,115
Well, that's another way of putting it.
But it doesn't sound as funny that way.

128
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,753
Of all the immature, aberrant behaviour
ever exhibited here, this is the lowest.

129
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,710
- What do you mean, Sam?
- You're the ringleader.

130
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,111
These lemmings
don't have minds of their own.

131
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,352
- She's right, Sam.
- Sad but true, Sammy.

132
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,115
- She is not.
- Whatever you say, boss.

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,398
Would you guys... Come on.
You're overreacting here, Diane.

134
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,190
lt's a harmless little prank, that's all.
All guys fall for it. lt's fun.

135
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,993
- Did you ever fall for it?
- Not personally.

136
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,550
But a lot of my friends have
and did they have a terrific time.

137
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,679
- You have to be a certain kind of guy.
- Yeah, a real dink.

138
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,191
Thanks a lot, Carla. Come on,
Frasier's got a sense of humour.

139
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,353
l bet he's up in the woods right now
laughing himself silly.

140
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,755
l am sure that he is not.

141
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,793
Like many who enter the psychiatric
profession, Frasier is a trusting man.

142
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,192
You took advantage of his trust.
He turned to you for a day of relaxation

143
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,351
and instead you gave him this -

144
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,193
a cruel, malicious, moronic prank.

145
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,275
A good-natured, fun,
character-building, moronic prank.

146
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,233
lf there's any decency among you,
you'll go back and find him.

147
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,228
- l'll go.
- Thank you for that flash of humanity.

148
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,516
l can't believe this.

149
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,197
l'm furious
with all of you for what you did.

150
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,476
Frasier, l can explain.

151
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,474
Why did you introduce me to that sport?
l'm hooked on it.

152
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,076
l was hoping you'd come back here
and l want to apologise.

153
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,313
After a couple of hours in the position,
l heard some snipe in the bush,

154
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,268
so l went off to pursue them
and l got lost in the woods.

155
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,399
l scrambled about for a while
until l heard the sound of cars.

156
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,075
So l flagged down an eighteen-wheeler
and made my way back.

157
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,076
Good friends, l'm sorry. l let you down.
lt's the last thing l wanted to do.

158
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,712
- Frasier, are you sure you're all right?
- Diane, l'm aglow. l'm transported.

159
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,829
l don't expect you to understand.
lt has to do with the bond between men.

160
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,715
Sorry. Coach, set up my buddies. l want
to drink to the camaraderie of this night.

161
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,829
- You don't have to do that, Frasier.
- Come on, what the hell?

162
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,317
- lt is the bagger's prerogative.
- Marvellous tradition. Let's drink to it.

163
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,519
May l have a word in private?
lt's about what happened tonight.

164
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,035
You're interfering with male bonding.

165
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,436
To snipe hunting.
The most humane of sports.

166
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,036
No guns. No knives.
Just a man and a plain simple bag.

167
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,839
Like you and Diane.

168
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,671
Come on. Guys make jokes
about their mates, right?

169
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,671
You probably think l'm being manic,

170
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,118
but l haven't spent that much time out
of doors in my life. l was exhilarated.

171
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,877
lt was a revelation to me how quiet it
was. l heard an owl for the first time.

172
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,273
l finally understand why guys get hung up
on going to the woods - camping, fishing.

173
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,673
Wait until you come home with a snipe
strapped to the hood of your car?

174
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,718
That's a thrill of a lifetime.

175
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,429
My one regret is we didn't get
a snipe. lt's all my fault.

176
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,275
- l let you guys down.
- No, you didn't disappoint us.

177
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,955
lf there's one thing you didn't do,
it was disappoint us.

178
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,468
l think it's time that we told you a little
something here. The fellas and l...

179
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,996
l hate to interrupt,
but you should go freshen up.

180
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,072
You're right, Diane. l'm filthy.

181
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,597
l want to thank all of you
for caring enough to include me tonight.

182
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,032
l don't believe it.
That guy is a bigger boob than Cliff.

183
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,716
No argument here.

184
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,150
What was the problem there?

185
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,710
- l was just going to tell him the truth.
- Do you have to?

186
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,316
What's the good
if you can't laugh in his face about it?

187
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,190
Listen to me. This may be hard for you
to understand, most things are,

188
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,678
but finding out that he was the butt
of your joke would be devastating.

189
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,116
He's always been the odd-man-out.

190
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,593
The kids would choose up sides for
softball, he was the last one picked.

191
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,274
''You take the girl, we'll take Frasier.''

192
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,989
Yeah, l remember. l always used
to feel sorry for those guys.

193
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,879
Even when l was doing it to them.

194
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,070
Yeah, Frasier was lucky. Some children
were laughed off the playground entirely.

195
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,632
- Not me. l was always out there.
- And you still are.

196
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,588
Maybe l'm just lucky, but nothing like that
ever really happened to me.

197
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,716
No. Wait a minute, Sam.

198
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,671
When l told you that you weren't invited
to the Red Sox alumni dinner this year?

199
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,308
l wasn't invited to the alumni dinner?

200
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,514
No, what am l talking about?
They're not even having a dinner.

201
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,874
But while l'm thinking about it,
can l have Saturday night off?

202
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,589
- What for?
- Death in the family.

203
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,512
Sure.

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,437
Come on. We got to tell Frasier.
You're holding up the laugh fest?

205
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,718
We don't have to tell Frasier
and we're not going to ever.

206
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,998
- Then why did we do it?
- You're obviously bored with lip diddling.

207
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,716
He's going to find out eventually.

208
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,839
We should be the ones to tell him
because we did the hard work.

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,358
He might not find out.
Frasier isn't an outdoorsman.

210
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,992
lf he should find out about it years later,
he'll be able to laugh about it.

211
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,596
Especially if some or all of you are dead.

212
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,517
- That isn't asking much, is it?
- Well, actually l...

213
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,148
- Sam.
- What?

214
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,357
There's one other thing
l want you to know.

215
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,079
Lord knows why, but...

216
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,118
...Frasier thinks of you as a friend.

217
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,478
As a matter of fact, he thinks of you
as one of his closest friends.

218
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,311
- Get out of here.
- He does, Sam.

219
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,594
Jeez, what a boo...boo...
<i>bootiful</i> guy he is.

220
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,713
All right. We'll do it your way.

221
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,077
Fellas, nobody tells Frasier
the truth, OK?

222
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,833
Well, it's a stupid oversight. lf Sam
Malone isn't invited, l'm not coming.

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,992
l'm kidding. l'll be there. Eight o'clock.

224
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,916
Wrong number.

225
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,790
Thank you, everyone. Believe me,
it's best to let this matter drop.

226
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,589
No need for Frasier
to suffer any embarrassment.

227
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,676
''Let the matter drop.'' l deserted and
now l need a woman to plead my case.

228
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,313
lf you feel that strong about it, maybe,
we could take another shot at it.

229
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,871
You'd do that for me?

230
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,157
Yeah, you bet we would.

231
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,793
- Fine. Well, let's get back out there.
- Out where?

232
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,077
- ln the wilds where the snipe run free.
- No.

233
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,198
l looked in the mirror.
Do you know what l saw?

234
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,511
A quitter.
A man who lets his buddies down.

235
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,035
l want to prove myself.

236
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,228
Well, hear that guys? Looks like Frasier
wants to go back out there tonight.

237
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,517
Absolutely. Tonight is
the night of the full moon.

238
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,513
Sam told me the snipe run best
when it's a full moon.

239
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,076
- l said that.
- That's right.

240
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,789
- And they'd be running all night, right?
- l said that, too.

241
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,317
- Well, then what are we waiting for?
- Nothing. Let's get out of here.

242
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,238
You're the first bagger l ever met to go
snipe hunting twice in the same night.

243
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,709
You're going to go down in the annals.

244
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,156
Sam, please.

245
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,189
Thanks for making us promise not to tell
him. So we give him a double whammy.

246
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,794
Frasier,
l need a moment alone with you.

247
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,635
- Can't this wait?
- We're feeling the thrill of the hunt.

248
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,553
- Yeah, so does Frasier.
- Frasier...

249
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,198
Women.

250
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,955
l guess she wants to kiss me.
You have to indulge them.

251
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,716
- Dames.
- That is why l don't have a girlfriend.

252
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,394
Reason number 27.

253
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,711
Frasier, sometimes people do
thoughtless things.

254
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,996
They don't mean any harm.
They just don't know any better.

255
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,597
You sound like the psychologist l had
at eight. What are you trying to say?

256
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,152
They played a childish prank on you.

257
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,790
- l know that.
- What?

258
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,910
A man does not crouch in the woods for
hours without having a revelation or two.

259
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,275
So this is part of a plan
and l unwittingly helped you?

260
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,072
Yes.

261
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,473
Frasier, how devious.
But why didn't you tell me?

262
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,668
- You'd have thought it was too cruel.
- Are you kidding? l would've helped.

263
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,196
- This is so unlike you.
- But it's what guys do.

264
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,318
We screw each other to the wall.

265
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,511
Boy, it's great to be one of the gang,
l'll tell you.

266
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,719
When we get up to that clearing, l'm
going to get them to pose for a photo.

267
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,316
After they disappear into the woods
l'm going to rush drive back

268
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,199
and make you
one of my famous omelettes.

269
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,708
- Frasier, l find your cunning arousing.
- Well, that's what it's there for, baby.

270
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,035
l've got to share this with the troops.

271
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,518
Men.

272
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,240
You're not going to believe this but

273
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,757
Diane just attempted to tell me
that there's no such thing as a snipe.

274
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,829
They will say anything to keep me
at home. You will not be a snipe widow.

275
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,913
All right now, men. Let's go get one.
To the woods.

276
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,398
l'm sorry, but in years to come we're
going to have a good laugh over this.

277
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,637
- Not all of us will be laughing.
- You'll see. Trust me.

278
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,430
- Hey, look, it's starting to snow.
- Don't worry, the colder the better.

279
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,915
