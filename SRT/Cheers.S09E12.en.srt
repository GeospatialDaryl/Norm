00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,700
      (theme song begins)       

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,400
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go    

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,300
    ¶ Where everybody           
    knows your name ¶           

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,800
      ¶ And they're always      
        glad you came ¶         

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,100
         ¶ You wanna be         
      where you can see ¶       

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,700
         ¶ The troubles         
    are all the same ¶          

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,000
      ¶ You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name. ¶  

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
                All right, okay,
                     here's one.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
        Hayley Mills, playing   
     herself and her twin sister

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,700
             in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>

14
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,900
     All right, all right.      

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,300
            Um, how             
about Elizabeth Montgomery      

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,500
  as both Serena and Samantha   
         in <i>Bewitched?</i>          

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,600
                 Ooh! Very nice!
Yeah. Yeah.                     

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
                      All right.
                         Cliffy?

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,400
Well, uh, Norm, I'd have to say 
  the, uh, queen of the genre,  

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,100
 Patty Duke, as both Patty and, 
  uh, the minuet-lovin' Cathy.  

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,900
                        FRASIER:
                             Oh!

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,300
What's the topic du jour?       

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,100
Actresses who have played       
their own look-alikes           

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
through the use                 
of trick photography?           

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,600
             No. Fictional twins
                we'd like to see

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,100
                      making out
                with each other.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,300
WOODY:                          
Hey, Sam,                       

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,500
                  the new Boston
                Merchants coupon
                    book is out,

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,100
and I got us in it.             

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,800
              Oh damn it, Woody!

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,500
              I hate that thing!

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,100
Well, maybe you don't           
understand how it works.        
                     Yeah, I do.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,700
            Guy comes in,       
         gives you a coupon.    

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
     You give him a free drink, 
             he leaves,         

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
     you never see him again.   

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, then                      
you do understand.              

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
        Woody...                

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
                Well, what, Sam?

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,300
                    You think it
                 was a bad idea?

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,400
        You think I shouldn't   
                have done it?   

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,500
          You think I'm a stupid
                idiot, right?   

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
No, no, that's... Yes!          

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,000
                      Well, I...
                 I'm sorry, Sam.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,300
            I just thought it   
                would attract   

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,900
                new customers   
                     to the bar.

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, a-a bunch of              
deadbeats and freeloaders.      

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,500
                        NORM:   
                        Yeah.   

48
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,200
        You don't want people   
              like that in here.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,100
                Another beer,   
                please, Wood.   

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,000
 Sam, that was John Allen Hill  
         on the phone.          

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,900
    He's on his way down.       
SAM:                            
No, no.                         

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,100
  I don't want to talk to him.  
        I hate that guy.        

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
     Sam, be a good businessman.
     He's our upstairs neighbor.

54
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,800
                      We have to
                  live together.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
                  Just try to be
                civil to him.   

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
All right, all right, all right,
  I'll be good. I'll be good.   

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,300
  You know, I get the feeling   
        sometimes               

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
  he deliberately says things   
          just 'cause           

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,300
      he knows it's gonna       
    get under my skin.          

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,600
              Sam!              

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
          See? God...           

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,300
Sam, it appears                 
we have a problem.              

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,600
Do you know what this is?       

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,200
            Yeah. Yeah, it looks
                like a manicure.

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,400
                  Nice one, too.

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
              Wait. Is that a...

67
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,900
        Is that clear polish,   
        or are they just buffed?

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,100
They're just clean.             

69
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,300
Sam, I'm concerned.             

70
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,200
Are you aware that your bar     
is featured in this coupon book?

71
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,400
                     Yeah, I am.
Well, my concern                

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,700
is how this will                
affect Melville's.              

73
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm not anxious                 
to greet the type of person     

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,900
you're obviously                
hoping to attract.              

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,900
            What are you saying?

76
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,500
                 You saying that
          you're better than me?

77
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
         That your customers are
             classier than mine?

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,600
              Well, they're not.
                        NORM:   
                     Hey, Sammy?

79
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
            Will you settle a   
             bet for us, please?

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,200
        Which one of our breaths
          smells most like tuna?

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
         Loser has to go through
        the spanking machine.   

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,500
          What do you want me to
        do, walk over and check?

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,400
I can tell you from here.       

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
                    Oh, yeah,   
                right, right.   

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
      And none of your customers
                have fish breath

86
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,500
          when they come walking
         out of your restaurant?

87
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,900
It's a seafood                  
restaurant, Sam.                

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,300
            Ah, all right, so   
            you admit it, right?

89
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
                      (grunting)

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Well, looks like                
the big boy lost.               

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,100
        Hi, guys.               

92
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
            Hey, Carla, I got   
              a message for you.

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
            Your brother called.

94
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
                 Something about
            a family meeting.   

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,800
Oh, yeah?                       

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,300
There!                          

97
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,500
                      Uh, here's
                your message.   

98
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
        That was my paycheck.   

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
      Carla, what's the problem?
        Why are you so upset?   

100
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
  Oh, I hate family meetings.   

101
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,300
  They're nothing but a bunch   
 of complaining and infighting  

102
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
and bickering and backstabbing. 

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,100
        And, of course,         

104
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,400
     sweet little Carla has     
    to play the peacemaker.     

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
                        FRASIER:
                        Well,   

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
I, for one, think               
family meetings                 

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
can be worthwhile               
encounters.                     

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,400
They encourage open             
and honest communication        

109
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,800
among the generations.          

110
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,100
            Did you have them   
                  in your family
                    there, Fras?

111
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,300
No, I lucked out.               

112
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,700
My family didn't want           
to be close.                    

113
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,000
If you're lying to me, I'm gonna
rip out your slimy, gray tongue.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,100
                        Whoa.   

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
                     Sounds kind
                     of serious.

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
                 It's my mother.

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
Well, what's the matter         
with her?                       

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,900
              She had the dream.

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,600
What dream's that?              

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
                The death dream.

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,700
             Whenever someone in
            my family has it,   

122
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,700
              you can just start
        divvying up the jewelry.

123
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
REBECCA:                        
What exactly                    

124
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,700
is this... death dream?         

125
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
                        FRASIER:
                            Yes,

126
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,900
      and, uh, why exactly      
    do you always do this...    

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,200
         when you say,          
    "the death dream?"          

128
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,900
                You just did it.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,900
        Carry on.               

130
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,500
                 Well, the dream
             is always the same.

131
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,500
      There's a casket on a slab
            in an empty room.   

132
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,000
      You walk slowly toward it.

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,900
                Suddenly, the   
                 lid flies open.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,300
                    You see your
                    own face?   

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
         No, you see these feet,

136
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,600
        'cause you're looking   
            at the wrong end.   

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,100
     Then, you look upward,     

138
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
and there's your own face,      

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,700
        pale and bluish         
  with pennies over your eyes.  

140
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,200
  And that's when you bolt up   
    in bed screaming.           

141
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,600
                        FRASIER:
                          Carla,

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,300
death is an earthly             
scientific passage              

143
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,900
predicted by either massive     
physical injury                 

144
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
or progressive                  
bodily deterioration.           

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,800
There is as little validity     
in a supposed death dream       

146
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
                        as there
                    is in the...

147
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,600
 clichéd image of death itself  
as a grim, bloodless ghoul      

148
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,500
 whose bony finger reaches out  

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,100
      to tap you on the shoulder
          when your number's up.

150
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,300
    Frasier, it's time          
             to go.             

151
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,400
        (screams)               

152
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,300
     Don't do that, woman!      

153
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,600
    For God's sakes,            

154
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
         put on some blush or...

155
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,500
                            SAM:
                          Honey,

156
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,300
              it's kind of slow.

157
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
            Why-Why don't you   
            take the day off,   

158
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
go see your mom, huh?           

159
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
                  Might I remind
                      you, Sam--

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
                 my mother and I
        don't exactly get along.

161
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
      You don't get along       
         with anybody.          

162
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,700
             Yeah, well, this is
         different, and shut up!

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,300
  The last time I saw my mother,
      we had this terrible fight

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,100
            about this stupid   
                family thing,   

165
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
                and I swore I   
            would never set foot

166
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
    in her lousy place again    

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
unless someone dragged me there 
     kicking and screaming.     

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
So, that's it, huh?             

169
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,100
            You're damned right.

170
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
(clicks tongue)                 

171
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,700
        Drag me, Sammy.         

172
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
            Really?             

173
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,500
        Do it. Drag me.         

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
      No! No! Cut it out!       

175
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
      I don't want to go!       

176
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,300
     No! No! I never want to see
that shriveled old bag again!   

177
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,800
                No! Put me down!

178
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
                         I don't
                     want to go!

179
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,700
    Oh, Carla, Carla!           

180
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,900
                Oh, nobody would
         believe you would come!

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
                 Oh, your sister
                is in there with
                your mother now,

182
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
                      and you go
                      next, yes?

183
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,000
              Oh, she will be so
            happy to see you.   

184
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,400
                     Carla!     
                    (laughs)    

185
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,900
Sam, you remember Zia,          
the hugger.                     

186
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,500
Yeah.                           

187
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
            Oh, Sam!            

188
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,900
Oh!                             

189
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,500
MAN:                            
You guys                        

190
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
          want a beer?          

191
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,700
        This is kind of         
    a solemn occasion, Sal.     

192
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
Malt liquor?                    

193
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,300
        I'll pass.              

194
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,800
             So, Zia, how's Mom?

195
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Carla, what kind                
of question is that?            

196
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,600
She had the dream.              

197
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,200
  So, she's really sick, huh?   

198
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
                 No. She doesn't
                have to be sick.

199
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
              She had the dream.
    Oh...                       

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
                    She'll be   
                      dead soon.

201
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
      Have you had lunch?       

202
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Uh, actually, yeah, I did.      

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
                Oh, then this   
                      is dinner.

204
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,500
     Oh, hey, thanks, Zia.      

205
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,100
    Eat up, Sam.                
 Our family believes in,        

206
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,600
  life is for the living.       

207
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
          (laughs)              

208
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,300
        Soon enough,            
     we'll all be dead,         

209
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,600
    rotting in the ground,      
 with a mouth full of worms.    

210
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
                 Great linguini.

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,400
        Thank you, Zia.         

212
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,600
Oh, Carla,                      
your sister's finished.         

213
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,500
             Bitch.             

214
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,900
          Slut.                 

215
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,100
    Oh, it's nice               
    to see them talking.        

216
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
             Mama.              

217
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,200
                    Angeline?   

218
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,400
No, Mama.                       

219
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
It's Carla.                     

220
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,600
                          Oh.   

221
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,200
                     My purse is
                 on the dresser.

222
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,000
    Mama, I didn't come here    
        for your money.         

223
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I came because                  
I feel bad                      

224
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,000
things got so ugly between us   
the last time I was here.       

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,700
              So, you've come to
            say you're sorry.   

226
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,900
Well, I'm sorry we fought.      

227
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
              Then you're sorry.

228
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,400
          I accept your apology.

229
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
         Good. I accept         
    your apology, too.          

230
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
                    I didn't say
                    I was sorry.

231
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, then,                     
I'm not sorry, either.          

232
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,500
             Too late. I already
          accepted your apology.

233
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,700
        Damn!                   

234
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,800
So, here...                     

235
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,100
now that we've made peace,      

236
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,200
  I want you to have the ring   

237
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
that my mother gave to me,      

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,400
and her mother                  

239
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,300
          gave to her.          

240
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
      Oh, Mama. The ring.       

241
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,600
                    What's this?

242
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,600
I hocked it.                    

243
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,700
    Come.                       

244
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Oh, your father's hair.         

245
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,100
                     Sorry, Mom.

246
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And now, Carla,                 

247
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
there is something              
you must do for me.             

248
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,700
        Oh, Mama, I know what   
            you're gonna ask me.

249
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,800
            We're just gonna get
            into that same fight

250
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,900
                 we had the last
                time I was here.

251
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,800
            I... It... It's just
                too much to ask.

252
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
                  I can't do it.

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,000
It's the family tradition.      

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,300
                    No.         

255
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
      I did it.                 

256
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
My mother did it.               

257
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,500
  Her mother did it.            

258
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,200
 Her mother did it              
 before her.                    

259
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,400
                    I said no.  

260
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,900
                    I don't care
                     who did it.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
    Her mother did it.          

262
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,600
                Mama, I'm sorry.

263
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
  I'm sorry you had the dream.  

264
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
  I'm sorry you're gonna die.   

265
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,600
 I'm sorry the family tradition 
     is gonna die with you.     

266
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
                But that is just
                  the way it is.

267
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,600
  I can't do this for anybody,  
     not even for my mama.      

268
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,700
    Her mother did it.          

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,100
                    Oh...       

270
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,300
    What's the matter, honey?   

271
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,200
    Oh, Sammy, Sammy.           

272
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,800
        It's this stupid        
    family tradition.           

273
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,000
Since the beginning of time,    
every woman in our family...    

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
      who has children...       

275
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,000
...has named                    
one of her sons                 

276
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
with the first name             
of her father                   

277
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
and the maiden name             
of her mother.                  

278
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
And I just wouldn't do it.      

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,900
            I don't mean to take
        your mother's side here,

280
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,000
                      but what's
                the big deal?   

281
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,200
            It's just a name.   

282
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,300
        Oh, yeah, sure,         
          just a name.          

283
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,900
          Why, uh, what was your
            father's first name?

284
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,100
    Benito.                     

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
            And your mother's   
                    maiden name?

286
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,800
    Mussolini.                  

287
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,600
                     Yikes.     

288
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
            Could I have some   
             more sauce, please?

289
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
         (Mama moaning)         

290
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,700
ZIA (gasps):                    
The death walk.                 

291
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,000
            She's still here.   

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,700
             I feel her presence
        like a shiv in my heart.

293
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,700
             Mama.              

294
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,900
I'm not rejecting you.          

295
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,900
I just don't want to name       
one of my sons Benito Mussolini.

296
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400
                  Why not?      

297
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,700
Because, back a few years,      

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,200
there was another               
Benito Mussolini.               

299
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,300
Remember him?                   

300
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
             I don't see why one
                Fascist dictator

301
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,100
              should ruin it for
              the entire family.

302
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,600
Mama, you are the only one      
who even cares                  

303
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,100
about that stupid name.         

304
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,300
     Everybody else agrees      
        with me, right?         

305
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
Oh, you're                      
an ungrateful child.            

306
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,100
            You make me sick.   

307
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,700
             Bitch.             

308
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
        Okay.                   

309
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,500
Well, just forget all of you.   

310
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,700
      I hate this family.       

311
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,000
    I hate this house.          

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,200
    I just never want           
    to come back here again.    

313
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,100
          I swear it.           

314
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,900
  I swear it a million times.   

315
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,400
 I swear on my children's eyes, 
     I am never, ever, <i>ever</i>     

316
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,800
  setting foot in this stupid,  
 ugly, stinkin' rattrap again.  

317
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Well, there goes my ride.       

318
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,100
 How can her mother expect her  

319
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,500
    to name one of her kids     
    after Benito Mussolini?     

320
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Well, it could                  
have been worse.                

321
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
What if her father's name       
had been Adolf?                 

322
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,500
             Yeah.              

323
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Yeah, and her mother's          
maiden name                     

324
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,400
could have been Menjou.         

325
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
    Phew.                       

326
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
She really dodged               
the bullet there.               

327
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
 Anyway, I gave her the day off 

328
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
so she could just go home       
    and cool out, you know.     

329
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
                Well, very often

330
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,500
that's the best thing           
you can do                      

331
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,600
when you're not getting along   
with a family member.           

332
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
Remove yourself                 
entirely from them.             

333
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,700
Find some neutral place         

334
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,300
where you can take the time     
you need to be away from them.  

335
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
                      You really
                 think so, Fras?

336
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, that's...                 

337
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,700
that's why we're                
all here, isn't it?             

338
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,400
            Thank you very much.

339
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,700
                    Great.      

340
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,800
             Four more freebies,

341
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,400
    thanks to Woody's           
      stupid coupon book.       

342
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,300
    I'm sorry, Woody.           

343
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,200
    I didn't see you there.     

344
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,600
Of course I'm there.            

345
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm always there.               

346
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Wherever there's                
a stupid idea,                  

347
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,000
that's where                    
you'll find me.                 

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Stupid old Woody Boyd--         

349
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
father of stupid thoughts,      

350
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,800
eye of the stupid storm.        

351
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,900
I've got to be the stupidest guy
on the face of the Earth.       

352
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,200
                Woody, please   
                 don't say that.
     Why not?                   

353
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
          Because you are giving
        me a stupid headache.   

354
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
  Welcome to my private hell.   

355
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
            Hi, Sam.            

356
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
How are you doing, honey?       
Better.                         

357
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,700
          I went home,          

358
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,600
      went to my bedroom,       
    shut off all the lights     

359
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
    and laid down on my bed.    

360
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,500
  Then... I started thinking.   

361
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,900
      What if I was dying       
and Serafina refused to do      

362
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,700
         the one thing          
that meant the most to me.      

363
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
    How would I feel?           

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,300
            So you apologized   
                 to your mother?

365
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,600
              No. I went out and
             yelled at Serafina.

366
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
            I felt a lot better.

367
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,800
      So I went and yelled      
  at all the rest of the kids.  

368
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
        Then I started thinking,

369
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,000
                 why should I be
             having all this fun

370
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,500
      when my mom's dying?      

371
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,300
So I decided I had to try       
    to do something for her.    

372
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,400
Well, I've got a bunch          
of these coupon books left.     

373
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,200
They're only good               
for a month,                    

374
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,900
but I guess in her case,        
that doesn't matter.            

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
                 Anyway, all the
                kids were there,

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,800
        so I figured it wouldn't
                hurt to ask them

377
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
if anyone would fulfill their   
        grandmother's dying wish

378
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,800
        and change their name   
            to Benito Mussolini.

379
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,900
                Any takers?     

380
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
                        No.     

381
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,600
          But I got two Madonnas
            and an MC Hammer.   

382
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,100
                    Well,       

383
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
          that's that.          

384
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
I tried everything I can.       

385
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,500
She didn't try                  
the coupons.                    

386
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,700
              Sam?              

387
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,300
                  God, I hate it
              when he says that.

388
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,400
 What? What? What're you gonna  
    nitpick this time?          

389
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,100
  What, am I mixing my drinks   
        too loud?               

390
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,900
Am I using the wrong kind       
         of lightbulb?          

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
            Oh, excuse me, maybe
              some of my bar air

392
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,200
          accidentally wafted up
          to your establishment.

393
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,900
Sam, you're on                  
the defensive.                  

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
    I'm not on the defensive,   
         and you say that again,

395
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
         I'm gonna pull the last
      three hairs off your head.

396
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,400
Sam, I merely came down         
to apologize                    

397
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,600
for my intrusive                
behavior earlier today.         

398
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,000
                    Really?     

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
    Yes.                        

400
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,900
I know I'd be resentful         
if someone implied              

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
that I should run my business   
in a particular way.            

402
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,700
It was out of line              
for me to do so with you.       

403
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,900
                      Oh.       

404
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
              Well... thank you.

405
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,400
                 I'm sorry, I am
             a little defensive.

406
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,400
Well, no harm done.             

407
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,300
In fact, to clear the air,      

408
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,800
I'd like to buy a round         
of drinks for everyone here.    

409
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,400
        (cheering)              

410
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,200
       Here you are, Sam.       

411
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,200
 I think this should cover it.  

412
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,800
        Oh, and I'd like        
  one of your special martinis  

413
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,200
I've heard so much about.       

414
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,400
    Oh, I'm out of coupons.     

415
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,100
    Well, then, never mind.     

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
            Hey, Ma.            

417
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,700
 Gino, what are you doing here? 

418
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
Well, Ma, I was thinking about  
all that stuff you said,        

419
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
you know about-about            
making Grandma happy,           

420
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,000
and I was talking it over       
with MC and the Madonnas,       

421
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,300
and I figured, heck,            

422
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
if it'll keep                   
this family together,           

423
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,900
someone's gotta do it.          

424
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,000
Ma, I'll be Benito Mussolini.   

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,200
                  Look, Gino,   

426
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,400
            do you even have any
         idea who Mussolini was?

427
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,300
Well, no, I didn't before,      

428
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,100
but then Anthony told me        
all about him.                  

429
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,200
Ma, this guy                    
ran this whole country.         

430
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,500
And do you know                 
what they called him?           

431
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
They called him <i>Il Duce.</i>        

432
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,700
Huh? The Dooch.                 

433
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Hey, yeah, that's right.        

434
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,600
It's me-- Dooch Tortelli.       

435
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
        That is a horrible name,

436
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,200
                and I never want
            to hear it again.   

437
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,300
                It sounds awful.
        (phone ringing)         

438
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,200
            I hate that name,   
                 and I hate Mama

439
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
                for asking me   
              to give it to you.

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,100
             Okay.              

441
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
 Carla, that was your brother.  

442
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,900
He said to get over there       
          right away.           

443
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Your mother's going fast.       

444
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,300
                      No.       

445
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
    I swore I'd never go back   
            in that house again.

446
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
                I have my pride.

447
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,800
             Okay.              

448
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,300
 Gino, want to grab her feet--  
I'll get the rest of her.       

449
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Come here, come here,           
come on, come on, come on.      

450
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,100
      No! No! Put me down!      

451
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,700
          Put me down!          
      I don't want to go!       

452
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,500
    Would you hoist me          
     a little higher, guys?     

453
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,700
I'd like to have some butt left 
    when I get there.           

454
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,800
            Oh, no.             

455
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,400
         I'm too late.          

456
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,800
Oh, Mama.                       

457
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,700
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.            

458
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Please forgive me.              

459
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
I hope you can hear me.         

460
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,200
I hope you can rest now.        

461
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,800
    I swear                     

462
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,300
        on your memory,         

463
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,100
that my Gino is now named       

464
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,300
Benito Mussolini.               

465
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,100
          Well, it's about time.

466
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,300
    I was getting bedsores.     

467
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,500
    You're not dead.            

468
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,000
  You're not dead at all.       

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,300
        You were never dying.   

470
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,700
                    You just did
            this to trick me.   

471
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,600
                    And you were
                all in on it.   

472
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,400
    We listen to our mother.    

473
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,100
    And we thought              
     it would be funny.         

474
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,600
GINO:                           
Ma! No, Ma!                     

475
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,800
      You, you never even       
         had the dream.         

476
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,000
You just did this               
to trick me                     

477
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
into getting to name            
my kid that stupid name.        

478
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,100
                    I had to.   

479
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,500
         You're stubborn as your
             grandmother's mule,

480
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
              who, incidentally,
        you were named after.   

481
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,000
              I honor tradition.

482
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, well, I'm gonna           
give you something to honor     

483
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,600
right in the labonz!            

484
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,000
Ladies, ladies, please, please. 

485
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,100
            Please.             
            Stay out of this,   

486
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,200
              if you know what's
            good for you, Paddy.

487
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,700
                         Listen,
                I may be old,   

488
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,200
        but I can still instruct
             others to hurt you.

489
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,200
                         Benito,
                kick your mother

490
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,500
            in the teeth for me.
Okay, Grandma.                  

491
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,400
    Don't you order...          

492
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
  Don't you order my son around.

493
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,800
             Gino, go punch your
         grandma in the kidneys.

494
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
    Okay, Ma.                   

495
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,100
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.    

496
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,700
                You, you're big,

497
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,000
  throw Carla out the window.   

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,200
         No, I'm not gonna throw
             her out the window.

499
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,800
                      All right.

500
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll do it, sick as I am.       

501
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,500
      Please, please, I...      

502
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,800
     Mrs. Lozupone, I don't mean
    to be disrespectful here,   

503
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
                  but, you know,
          you're not being fair.

504
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,700
                You're asking   
              your daughter here

505
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,800
              to-to name her son
        after a very bad man.   

506
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,100
And-and you faked death         

507
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,400
            to get her to do it.

508
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,700
            I mean, these are   
                 not your, uh...

509
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,000
          typical mother things.

510
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,800
Are you saying I'm a bad mother?

511
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,600
             Well, yeah, in this
            case, yeah, I am.   

512
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,000
(all gasping)                   

513
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
                          CARLA:
                            Sam.

514
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
             What?              

515
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,800
You insulted my mother.         

516
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
In her own house.               

517
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,900
With the food that we           
cooked over her deathbed        

518
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
still stuck                     
in your teeth.                  

519
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
                Is that bad?    

520
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,800
         (all hissing)          

521
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,800
      (hissing continues)       

522
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,800
That's great, Carla.            

523
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm glad                        
you guys made up.               

524
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,200
         Well, his name         
    is now Benito Mussolini.    

525
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,800
Call him Gino, for short.       

526
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah, she sounds                
so happy.                       

527
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,900
 She said that's the first time 
      they've all sat down      

528
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,200
  to a family dinner in years.  

529
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
    They ate, they laughed,     

530
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,000
they even                       
got up and danced.              

531
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
Those Italian families          
sound so warm.                  

532
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,300
          Yeah, I know          
     what you mean, Woody.      

533
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,900
Gee, I often wish that I was    
a member of an ethnic group.    

534
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Oh, it's...                     

535
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
Oh, it's just as well.          

536
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,000
I hate hugging.                 

537
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Frasier, it's time to go.       

538
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,700
Boy, I-I sure married           
the right woman.                

539
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,800
              Good-bye, Mama.   

540
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,400
            I love you.         
    Mmm.                        

541
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
              See you next week.

542
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
              Oh, wait a minute,
      I almost forgot something.

543
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,600
Good night, Sammy.              

544
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,800
                      (muffled):
            Carla, please let   
                 me out. Please.

545
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,000
Sammy, would you                
stop whining?                   

546
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,600
    It's a family tradition.    

547
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,000
        You cross Mama,         
     you sleep in the wall.     

548
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,400
    (muffled shouting)
