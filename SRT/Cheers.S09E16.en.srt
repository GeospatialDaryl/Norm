00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,100
        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,300
          Watch this.           
                         Okay...

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,400
          What do you got, Wood?

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,800
Watch closely as I remove       
      my own index finger.      

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,500
    Uh-huh.                     

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,600
    It's something I learned    
         from my uncle,         

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,600
only when I do it, it's a trick.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,600
              Eh?               

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,800
            Uh, not bad but, uh,

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,800
          I think Cliffy's still
        ahead on points here.   

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,700
     And in what sophomoric     
            activity            

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,700
    are you gentlemen           
         involved now?          

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,700
Our first annual tricks         
with digits exhibition!         

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,100
Of all the pointless wastes     
of human energy.                

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,900
                Frasier's right.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
        You could sit here until
      the end of time doing your

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,900
  silly little finger tricks,   

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,600
but none of you will ever       
      be able to top this.      

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,900
    Wow, she's right.           

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,800
The king is dead.               

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,500
Long live the queen!            

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,100
                        NORM:   
          Yes and she's writing!

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,300
                 She's going for
                bonus points.   

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,700
                          CLIFF:
                  What's it say?

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,700
"My fist is stuck.              
Call 911."                      

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
            FRASIER:            
         Come on, hon.          

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,300
                  You know, this
                  happens to her

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
                 more often than
                    you'd think.

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,700
      (theme song begins)       

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,100
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
 Takes everything you've got  

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
 Sure would help a lot         

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,300
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,300
   Sometimes you want to go    

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,300
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,900
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,700
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,400
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,000
   People are all the same     

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

45
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
How am I supposed to make       
      a drink around here?      

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,100
  We're out of gin, vermouth,   
    cherries and lime juice.    

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,700
We gotta get into               
that storeroom.                 

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
                    We can't.   

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,300
         Sam said to substitute.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,300
Okay.                           

51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,300
                    Here you go.

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,400
What the hell                   
is this?                        

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
                It's clam juice.

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,200
      I wanted a martini.       

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,900
         I wanted to be Princess
                Carla of Monaco.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
                    Drink it!   

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,300
                          Sorry,

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
         Mr. Krapence.          

59
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
  We can't get into the office  
        or the storeroom        

60
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,700
    because Miss Howe           
    locked herself in           

61
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,000
 since she decided not to marry 
          Mr. Colcord.          

62
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,800
                     She's still
                    in there.   

63
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
                     She's still
                    in the gown.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,100
                  She won't talk
                     to anybody.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,600
                Doesn't move.   
                    Doesn't eat.

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,100
    Gee, that's awful.          

67
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
I really wanted a martini.      

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,900
         Greetings all!         

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,700
A pint of lager,                

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
    my good publican!           

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm of a Dickensian spirit      
             today.             

72
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,300
I've just come from             
the Antiquarian Book Fair,      

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,600
where I managed to luck         
into a handsomely bound         

74
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
first edition of Charles        
Dickens' <i>Tale of Two Cities.</i>    

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,200
                            Wow!

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,300
            If you don't mind   
                      my asking,

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,300
         how much does something
      like this cost, Dr. Crane?

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Well, uh, Woody, money          
isn't really the issue,         

79
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,100
but, uh, around $1,200.         

80
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,400
              (scoffs, snickers)

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,900
                    1,200 bucks?

82
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,700
                Got something to
            show you, Dr. Crane.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,500
                It's called a   
                library card.   

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,300
Thank you for the advice, Woody.

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
    Now may I have a scotch     
     on the rocks, please?      

86
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,900
                    Okeydoke!   

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
            That'll be around   
                    1,200 bucks.

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,500
     Oh, Frasier, you know,     
 it's a good thing you're here  

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
                because we gotta
            think of some way   

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
          to get that crazy lady
              out of the office.

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
             It's been two days.

92
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
      Well, I realize that      
 you're concerned about Rebecca 

93
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,000
  and that you all look to me   

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
         as the solver          
of all problems personal,       

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
    but, in this case,          
  I have to throw up my hands.  

96
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,500
    I mean, there's a limit     
     to what even I can do.     

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,100
                And we also know
                    how you pout

98
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
          when we don't ask you.

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,700
         Well... fine.          

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,700
    Maybe I'll just go home.    

101
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,300
             Okay!              

102
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
  I've got the tool box here.   

103
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
I'm gonna get Rebecca out       
of that office right now.       

104
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,900
            Rebecca!            

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,700
  I've got a screwdriver here!  

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm gonna take that doorknob off

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
  and I'm gonna open the door   
             here.              

108
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,800
 Rebecca, I got a Phillips head 
          by mistake,           

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,000
        but I'm gonna...        

110
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm putting that down and       
I'm picking up a flathead,      

111
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,000
  and then I'm gonna take that  
         doorknob off.          

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
     Rebecca, I don't have      
          a flathead,           

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
    but I have one of those     
          putty things          

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
    and I'm gonna put it...     

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
             Damn!              

116
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, Rebecca, I just punctured 
my thumb with that, uh...       

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,200
  putty thing and I'm gonna go  
      get a tetanus shot,       

118
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,200
          then I'm...           

119
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,200
coming back here                
and taking that doorknob off.   

120
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,200
              Here's a Band-Aid.

121
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,100
Hey, hey, guys!                 
Rebecca!                        

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
Hey!                            
    Rebecca's out.              
                        REBECCA:
                         No, no.

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
              Don't say Rebecca.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
                Don't call me   
                        Rebecca.

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,500
            Rebecca doesn't live
                here anymore.   

126
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
                Rebecca died two
                    days ago.   

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Oh! So that's                   
what that is.                   

128
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,500
    Whoof!                      

129
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm telling you,                

130
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,900
a woman should never            
sweat in taffeta.               

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,500
              Have a seat.      
                Come on.        

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,700
                      Thank you.

133
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,300
                         Wow.   

134
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,100
                I've never sat  
                 here before.   

135
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,200
              Here I am, sitting
                  on this stool,

136
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,700
                 knowing my life
                      is a mess.

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
        I have no future, and...

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,700
                 I'm a totally  
            hopeless failure.   

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,700
  Yeah. Try it                  
  with beer nuts.               

140
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,900
             It is all my fault.

141
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,600
                I mean, I got   
                 what I deserve.

142
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,800
              And now I'm alone.

143
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,200
             I... I have nothing
                 and I'm just a,

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,800
            you know, worthless,
                 shallow person.

145
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm telling you,                
try it with the beer nuts.      

146
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,300
        Rebecca...              

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,100
  I realize you haven't sought  
  my professional advice, but   

148
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
I think it's time               
to get some perspective,        

149
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,600
    take a look at yourself.    

150
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,000
 Splash some water on your face 
     and get a fresh start.     

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
        I'd like to, Frasier,   

152
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,100
         but I seem to have lost
            the will to move.   

153
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,100
         I just want to sit here
        for the rest of my life.

154
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,400
          Geez, maybe           
        it's the stool.         

155
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,200
                        Come on,
                      Miss Howe.

156
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
                Woody...        

157
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,000
         have you ever          
      had your whole life       

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
              cave in on you    
             all of a sudden?   

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,300
  No, but I have had            
  a cave cave in on me          

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,700
    all of a sudden.            

161
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,100
You know, at the risk           
of sounding insensitive,        

162
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,100
I'm... I'm glad she's           
getting out of here.            

163
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,300
Her walking around              
in that wedding dress           

164
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,800
was just a tad too              
"Miss Havisham" for me.         

165
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,000
                        Who?    
Miss Havisham.                  

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Famous character                
from Charles Dickens'           

167
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,300
 <i>Great Expectations.</i>            

168
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
Spends the entire novel         

169
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,900
walking around                  
in her wedding dress.           

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,900
                What?!          
                            Yes.

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Well, surely you know it.       

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
    It's <i>Great Expectations.</i>    

173
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,300
      Pip? Miss Havisham?       

174
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
            Magwich?            

175
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,200
And, uh... and four...          

176
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,300
pizza-loving turtles            

177
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
who practice martial            
arts in the sewer.              

178
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,200
        Oh, cowabunga, dudes!   

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,500
                          CLIFF:
                    You know,   

180
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
there's a lot of people         
    don't realize               

181
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,000
      that that was             
a comic book first.             

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 I'm gonna go for a drive, Sam. 

183
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,700
SAM:                            
Oh, yes, sweetheart.            

184
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
That's a good idea.             
You know, get some fresh air.   

185
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,500
Take all the time               
you want.                       
Thank you.                      

186
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,300
Where did she get those clothes?

187
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,600
                          WOODY:
             Hey, Sam, could you
            dig some clothes out

188
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,500
    of lost and found?          

189
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
          Here you go.          

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
    Woody, come on out here.    
    Let's take a look.          

191
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,000
          Hey, Sam, how long did
        you say these clothes   

192
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
                have been in the
                 lost and found?

193
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
         I don't know--         
     a while, I guess. Why?     

194
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,100
(laughing)                      

195
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Is that Woody Boyd?             

196
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,400
Or is that                      
Keith Partridge?!               

197
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,100
 When is Miss Howe getting back 
     with my real clothes?      

198
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,900
     I can't go out like this.  

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
        I mean, I know it was   
          the '70s and all,     

200
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,700
 but who would dress in anything
        this dumb-looking?      

201
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,900
    Those duds look familiar.   

202
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,000
        "Property               
         of C. Clavin."         

203
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,300
Deep inside, didn't             
we all know that?               

204
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,900
        (laughing)              

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,700
                  These are your
            clothes, Mr. Clavin?

206
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,000
         Yeah, I guess.         

207
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,400
    Well, how'd they end up     
     in the lost and found?     

208
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,800
 How did they end up in there?  

209
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, it was the '70s,          

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,100
(chuckles):                     
and I was a swinger.            

211
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,800
             Uh-oh.             

212
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,700
I had some good times           
in those rags, Woody.           

213
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,500
         Cliff, we don't want to
          hear about it, please.

214
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
Huh? Oh, it was great.          

215
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,700
You know, hey,                  
the disco scene,                

216
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,700
                    grooving.   

217
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Ixnay, Cliff.                   

218
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,600
          Yeah, it was          
      a great decade, huh?      

219
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,900
    Hot-tubbing every night.    

220
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,000
         I got rolfed.          

221
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,200
WOODY:                          
Oh.                             

222
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,600
    Please stop, Mr. Clavin.    

223
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,000
    Oh, now I remember          
how I lost those clothes.       

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,700
    Oh, don't say it;           
         don't say it.          

225
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,300
I was streaking!                

226
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Oh! I knew it!                  

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
I knew he was gonna             
say it!                         

228
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,600
Of course, I was about          
three pounds lighter then.      

229
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,900
                        FRASIER:
                        Woody...

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,100
    I think it was              
a great sacrifice               

231
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
     for you to give            
your clothes to Rebecca.        

232
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
              It puts me in mind

233
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,300
      of another novel by       
  my favorite British author.   

234
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
      You know who I mean.      

235
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,500
I'll give you a hint.           

236
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,400
          Charles...?           

237
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,700
                     In Charge? 

238
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,700
    (laughs)                    

239
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,700
Are you people really           
this ignorant                   

240
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,700
or do you just do this          
to torture me?                  

241
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,700
        Uh, sometimes the two   
                go hand-in-hand.

242
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
All right.                      

243
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
  Gather around,                
  everyone.                     

244
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
I am going to right             
a horrible wrong.               

245
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
I am going to read to you       
Dickens' classic,               

246
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,600
 <i>A Tale of Two Cities,</i>          

247
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,400
                and you will see
            just how much fun   

248
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,900
        great literature can be.

249
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,400
         (all groaning)         

250
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,900
                        FRASIER:
                "Book the First.

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
It was the best of times,       
  it was the worst of times."   

252
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Hey, wait,                      
whoa, whoa, whoa.               

253
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Which was it?                   

254
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
     Just stay tuned, Norm.     

255
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
"It was the age of wisdom,      
 it was the age of foolishness. 

256
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,300
 It was the epoch of belief, it 
 was the epoch of incredulity." 

257
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
     Boy, this Dickens guy      
          really liked          

258
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
to keep his butt covered,       
        didn't he?              

259
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,300
    "There was a king           
    with a large jaw,           

260
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
"and a queen with a plain face, 

261
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,200
                  "on the throne
                     of England.

262
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,700
            "And... and..."     

263
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,100
    "...and there was           
     a bloodthirsty clown,      

264
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,900
          "who beckoned innocent
        children into the sewer,

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
and swallowed them whole."      

266
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,600
                      Ah!       

267
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,300
            That's a neat trick.

268
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,100
        (phone ringing)         

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,900
 Wait-wait-wait a minute, Fras, 
          wait there.           

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,300
      Yeah, Cheers. What?       

271
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,300
     Hey... uh... Rebecca!      

272
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,500
  Where are you calling from?   
     I can barely hear you.     

273
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,900
30,000 feet over Pittsburgh.    

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,100
             What?              

275
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,800
    I thought you were just     
    going for a drive.          

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,500
             I did.             
    I drove to the airport.     

277
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
            Listen,             

278
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,600
      will you tell Woody       
      that I left his car       

279
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,100
  outside the United terminal.  

280
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
          Or American.          

281
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,900
    It doesn't really           
      make any difference.      

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,300
    They all tow them           
to the same place anyway.       

283
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,900
         Sam, is that Miss Howe?

284
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,400
                  Ask her if she
                  has my wallet.

285
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,700
                    I need my   
            driver's license.   

286
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,600
Actually, you don't             
have to worry about             
that right now, Wood.           

287
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
What are you doing?             
Where are you going?            

288
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,900
    I'm-I'm going home          
    to San Diego, Sam.          

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,700
I want to try and forget Boston.

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,100
        I want to erase         
the last three years of my life.

291
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,400
    It's been five, Rebecca.    

292
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,600
     Has it been that long?     

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,100
              Hey, Sam, does she
                 have my wallet?

294
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
You still have Woody's          
wallet, don't you?              

295
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,500
  Yeah, sure, how do you think  
I'm paying for this call?       

296
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
     Hell, how do you think     
  I'm paying for this flight?   

297
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah, she still has it.         

298
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,300
Honey, listen to me.            

299
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,400
You can't run away from         
your problems like this.        

300
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
        Sam, Sam, look,         
    the only reason I called    

301
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,900
      was to say good-bye       
 and thank you for everything.  

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,700
 It's really meant a lot to me. 
            Bye-bye.            

303
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,600
Oh, miss, did you remember      
your credit card?               

304
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,100
    Oh, yeah, thanks.           

305
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
      I'm gonna need this.      

306
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,700
I need to buy a whole new       
     wardrobe when we land.     

307
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,200
  I'm gonna be good to myself.  

308
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
        As we recall...         

309
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,600
from Monday's installment       
    of <i>A Tale of Two Cities,</i>    

310
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,000
 Sydney Carton was about to go  
    to the guillotine           

311
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,900
     and sacrifice himself.     

312
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
The guillotine--                
slice that neck.                

313
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,900
        (laughing)              

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,500
        "When suddenly,         
    an Apache attack chopper    

315
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,500
 "hovered above the guillotine, 

316
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,700
        pumping hot lead        
        into the crowd."        

317
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,600
            Get them Frogs, huh?

318
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,900
    "As Darnay climbed          
    into the chopper,           

319

        "sweat streaming

321
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,500
    "'It is a far, far          
    better thing I do

    "'than I have ever done.

326
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,400
                All right.      
  Whoa!                         

327
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,100
          What a book, huh?     

328
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,900
                  Yeah, that was
             great, great, Fras.

329
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
          What, uh, what are you
    going to read to us next?   

330
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,700
Well, I was thinking about,     
uh, <i>David Copperfield.</i>          

331
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,900
    What's that about?          

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,300
Well, it's about                
these, uh...                    

333
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,600
two coppers,                    
and this... field,              

334
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
um... and they're found...      

335
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
dismembered with their          
body parts switched.            

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
CARLA:                          
Man...!                         

337
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,900
    Man, that Dickens           
    is one sick dude.           

338
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,400
      Have any of you guys      
    heard from Rebecca yet?     

339
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,700
            Normie.             
            Turn on the game,   
                  will you, Sam?

340
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,900
      No, no, no, come on,      
          let's, uh...          

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,700
Let's give her                  
a call here.                    

342
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,700
I got her parents'              
number here.                    

343
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,900
Let's just tell her that,       
        you know,               

344
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
    we're thinking about her    
    and that we care.           

345
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,400
        Ah, hell,               
it's her parents' machine.      

346
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,800
      I hate these things.      

347
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,400
I never know what to say.       

348
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,700
  Hi. This is Sam from Cheers.  

349
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,200
Uh, this message is for Rebecca.

350
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
        Um, hi, Rebecca.        

351
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,800
We just wanted to find out      
        if you're okay,         

352
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,200
          and tell you          
     that we all miss you,      

353
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
        and I love you,         
    and I hope that...          

354
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,500
                 Oh, oh, Sam.   
         Wh-What?               

355
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,100
                You love her?   

356
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
  No. No, I-I didn't say that.  

357
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,500
    Hold on a second.           
     No, I didn't say that.     

358
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,400
     No, no, I said-I said      
  we miss her and we love her.  

359
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,900
            You said we miss her
            and you love her.   

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Yeah, but it was implied        
that you miss her, too.         

361
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,800
          Well, shoot.          

362
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,200
  I-I-I don't want her to get   
the wrong impression here.      

363
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,600
    Uh, hi, Rebecca, listen,    
  when I said that I love you,  

364
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,400
     you know I didn't mean     
        love love.              

365
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,800
 I, uh, you know, I meant more  
    like a friend, you know,    

366
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,500
      a buddy, a pal, uh,       
like a partner, you know.       

367
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,300
    Like the two cops           
     in <i>David Copperfield.</i>      

368
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
Okay, honey?                    

369
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,100
     Well, anyway, bye-bye.     

370
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,900
                     Wait, no...
Wait, hold on.                  

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,200
         That was a little cold.

372
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
                 Yeah, you know,

373
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,800
listen, she's, uh,              
she's feeling kind of low.      

374
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
You can't just kick her         
when she's down like that.      
                      Yeah.     

375
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,100
  Sweetheart, when-when I said  
that I love you, you know,      

376
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,000
  I meant that you're a-a very  
important part of my life,      

377
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,300
you know, along with a lot      
        of other people.        

378
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,200
     It-it's, uh, you know,     
      it's like my-my life      

379
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
is this big jigsaw puzzle,      

380
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,200
          and you are           
     a very important part.     

381
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,200
        You know,               
like a corner piece, huh?       

382
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
        All right.              

383
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Hold on. Oh...                  

384
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
  I think the guys want to say  
something here. Go ahead.       

385
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
             GUYS:              
        Sammy loves you.        

386
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,100
Hey, any of you guys tried that 
new steak house on Commonwealth?

387
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,900
              No.               

388
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,200
It's the greatest.              

389
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Beautiful waitresses            
in tiny little wench outfits.   

390
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,100
                      Yeah? What
                did you have?   

391
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,900
    Beautiful waitress          
 in a tiny little wench outfit. 

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,700
      I'm going back, too.      

393
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,800
Dr. Crane, when are you going   
to read us some more Dickens?   

394
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
          (chanting):           
Dickens, Dickens, Dickens.      
LILITH: Oh, well.               

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,300
Frasier, I'm impressed.         

396
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,000
It seems your experiment        
in cultural enrichment          

397
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,900
has been a success.             

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,300
 Yep. We're waiting for <i>Oliver</i>  
   <i>Twist: The Wrath of Fagin.</i>   

399
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Excuse me?                      

400
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,200
         Darling, I've done some
    things the past few weeks   

401
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,000
          I'm not very proud of.

402
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,600
            Just leave it alone.

403
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Shoot, shoot, shoot.            

404
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Hey, guys...                    

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,400
listen to this.                 

406
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,600
        (recorder beeps)        
     Sam, this is Rebecca.      

407
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
      I got your message.       

408
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
    Hearing your voice          
        made me realize         

409
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,800
        what I'm missing        
    in my life, and...          

410
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,100
     and I was such a fool      
  not to have seen it before.   

411
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,600
         My plane lands         
      at midnight tonight,      

412
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,200
    and I'm coming straight     
     to the bar to see you.     

413
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,200
      So will you please,       
      please wait for me?       

414
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,600
             (beep)             

415
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
                    (snickering)

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
What am I gonna do?             

417
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,600
      I mean, do you think      
  that she's coming back here   

418
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,600
  because I left that message   
        on her machine?         

419
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,800
             Yeah.              

420
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,600
 Hey, will you be serious here  
         for a minute?          

421
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
Just once I'd like to have      
a serious conversation          

422
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
in this damn bar.               
                     Okay. Fine.
                         Mm-hmm.

423
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,200
      Do you really think       
    that she's rushing back     

424
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,800
because I said I love you?      

425
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
        Mm, yeah.               

426
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,300
    What do you know.           

427
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,500
 I'm gonna talk to somebody who 
  knows something around here.  

428
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,900
              What do you think?

429
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,100
You're dead meat                
on a stick.                     

430
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,700
     No, I'm not dead meat      
          on a stick.           

431
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
        You know,               
and even if she does think that,

432
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,000
    I've handled lots           
      of love-crazed babes      

433
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
    who want to become          
    Mrs. Sam Malone.            

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,300
      I got dozens of ways      
    of handling that.           

435
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,000
        You know,               
  even if they all don't work,  

436
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,400
      I still have Plan Z.      

437
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,700
What's, uh,                     
Plan Z there, Sam?              

438
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
        Never you mind.         

439
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,300
It's pretty drastic, I'll admit,

440
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,000
 but I'll use it if I have to.  

441
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,800
SAM:                            
I-I...                          

442
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,400
  I don't want the same woman   
        hanging onto me         

443
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,900
    for the rest of my life.    

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
  I mean, can you imagine how   
 creepy that would be, Frasier? 

445
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
             I'll... answer that
          question another time.

446
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,700
            Okay, Leon, you just
              wait outside there

447
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
        and come running in when
    you see the lights flash.   

448
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,800
Right.                          

449
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
            Carla, Sammy will   
                    not tell us.

450
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,700
            What is this Plan Z?

451
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll tell you everything I know 
for 20 bucks each.              

452
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,200
        All right.              

453
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,500
It's called Plan Z.             

454
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,300
When Sammy flashes the lights,  

455
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,300
this guy Leon comes in          
and executes it.                

456
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,300
             Okay, well, what...
                 what <i>is</i> Plan Z?

457
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,500
    Beats me.                   

458
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,300
I didn't know that much         
two minutes ago.                

459
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Give me the money.              

460
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,500
I think it was worth it.        

461
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,500
                Oh, yeah.       

462
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,700
             Sam, it seems to me

463
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,300
  you're going through an awful,
    awful lot of machinations   

464
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,900
    to avoid dealing honestly   
      and directly with Rebecca.

465
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,500
Well, that's me,                
you know, always thinking.      

466
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,400
Besides, you know,              
I don't think we're gonna       
have to use Plan Z here.        

467
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,800
I mean, what are we             
talking about?                  

468
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,000
We're talking about Rebecca.    

469
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,300
I mean, what's                  
the worst she can do?           

470
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,000
              Sam.              

471
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,900
I hope you're ready to change   
your life, because I am.        

472
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,600
                    Ah...       

473
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
    Can you excuse me           
    just a second here, hon?    

474
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,000
Sam, why are you flashing       
          the lights?           

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh, you know, it's just kind of 
      to welcome you back.      

476
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
  You know like, three cheers,  
      hey, Rebecca's back.      

477
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
        Rebecca's back.         

478
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,600
REBECCA:                        
Sam,                            

479
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,100
         get over here,         
    quit being silly.           

480
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,600
  I have to ask you something   
    really important.           

481
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,500
      Will you sell me this bar?

482
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,200
    No. What?                   

483
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,600
  Cheers-- I want to buy Cheers.

484
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,200
 Running this place was the only
 time I ever felt like somebody.

485
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,000
                You know, people
                looked up to me.

486
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,500
        Who?                    

487
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,100
You mean you didn't come        
back here to marry Sam?         

488
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,300
                  Marry Sam?!   

489
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,300
                No, why would   
                 you think that?

490
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
You didn't think that, did you? 

491
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,500
        Shoot, no.              

492
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,900
    That's why you've been doing
        all this weird stuff.   

493
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,300
        Because you think I came
         back here to marry you?

494
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
    What weird stuff?           

495
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,500
I can't keep                    
living a lie, Sam.              

496
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
         No, no, no, Leon.      

497
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Sam is my lover.                

498
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
          Boy, you...           

499
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,900
      you really <i>did</i> think      
        I was after you.        

500
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,100
                        REBECCA:
        I can't believe this.   

501
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
     You are a wussy little     
          fraidy cat.           

502
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,000
              I'm not a wussy   
            little fraidy cat.  

503
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,500
     Oh, then this is real?     

504
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,300
                    You and Leon
                     are lovers.

505
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,200
        Well, why don't you give
            Leon a kiss then?   

506
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,800
              Because we've been
          together for 14 years,

507
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
             and we're no longer
                  demonstrative.

508
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,900
              You know, the, uh,
            the spark's gone.   

509
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,600
                I'm sorry, Leon.

510
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,300
          I probably should have
          said something sooner.

511
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,800
        No, no, no, Sam,        
  you can't have it both ways.  

512
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,200
 You either give Leon a kiss... 

513
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,200
         on his lips...         

514
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,500
                    or you admit
                    that you are

515
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,500
      a wussy little fraidy cat.

516
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
Sammy, don't let her            
make you look like              

517
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,400
a wussy little fraidy cat.      

518
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,100
        I'm not a wussy         
    little fraidy cat.          

519
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,700
        (Carla meowing)         

520
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
What are we                     
supposed to think?              

521
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,000
         Sorry about that, Leon.

522
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,900
You realize I'm gonna have      
to slug you in the face now.    

523
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,700
            I wish you would.   

524
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,500
                 (Cliff and Norm
                    groaning)   

525
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,300
We, uh, still on for golf       
          on Thursday?          

526
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
Yeah, you bet, Leon.            

527
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,500
             Great.             

528
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,300
Oh, ow...                       

529
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
That hurt.                      

530
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
      Sammy, look at you.       

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,300
          Your nose is bleeding.

532
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,900
                     Your eye is
              starting to swell.

533
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,900
      And you just kissed a man.

534
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,900
          But you're not a wussy
              little fraidy cat.

535
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,200
             NORM:              
    You ain't afraid.           
                  No, not Sammy.

536
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,400
                        NORM:   
                    Good boy.   

537
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,700
          Good, Sam.            
                    You know,   

538
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,900
          in the space          
    of the last 30 seconds,     

539
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
we have witnessed deceit,       
         sexual turmoil         

540
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,900
                     and sudden,
             senseless violence.

541
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,200
    It puts me in mind          
      of a passage from...      

542
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,500
      <i>The Pickwick Papers.</i>
