                  weren't they?

will run all month,

how many jelly beans            
are in this jar.                

18
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:47,195
          Uh... 3,500.          

19
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:49,614
Woody, is that                  
the correct number?             

20
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,015
                    Nope.       

21
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,952
                     Off by 163.

00:00:57,422 --> 00:01:00,659
You are not supposed            
to tell them that.              

24
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:03,161
Now we have to do this          
all over again.                 

25
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,797
Do you have any extra           
jelly beans back there?         

26
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,432
    Sure, there's a whole bag   
    at the end of the bar.      

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,670

No, no, no. Not necessary.

          to prove to you guys

we've never met before.

If you watch very closely       
you will notice,                

92
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:10,798
that at no time does my hand    
actually leave her body.

98
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,619
    is it hot in here           
    or is it just me?

     where that came from.

    Are you for real?           

102
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,744
 I've been asked that question  
          many times,           

103
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,746
            and by women a lot

107
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,790
    but I can't actually say    
    I've ever met one.

112
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,050
    Maybe too clever.           

113
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,869
        What's it mean?         

114
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,673
It means I'd like to order      
          a Manhattan.          

115
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,575
  I'd like you to put a cherry  
             in it,             

116
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,877
     and then I'd like you      
     to put a sock in it.

00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,697
        walks into              
     his therapist's office     

126
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,033
     suffering from a case      
    of Korsakoff's psychosis    

127
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,834
brought on by acute alcoholism. 

128
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,002
          Brain tumor.          

129
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,037
 Well, darling, it doesn't make 
        any difference.         

130
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:40,871
         Yes, it does.          

131
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,123
    Brain tumor is funnier.     

132
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,891
         You're right.          

133
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,563
No wonder I didn't get anywhere.

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,531
    She's a friend of Lilith    
         and Frasier's.         

135
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,032
She's another one of those      
            boring,             

136
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,233
cold-hearted intellectuals      

137
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,820
with legs I could kill for.     

138
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,855
            Why, Sam?           
            I like your legs.   

139
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,259
        If you comb your hair   
        a little different,     

140
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,094
         no one will even notice
         that ear problem.      

141
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,915
                      Thank you.

142
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,851
And then the therapist said     

143
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,252
"No, I said ten cc's,           
not Tennessee."                 

144
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,123
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

145
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,959
      Or was it Kentucky?       

146
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,126
    It was Tennessee.           

147
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:21,095
    Well, it was good.          

148
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:24,098
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

149
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,500
I'll have to remember that one. 

150
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:28,202
                Hello, Lilith.  
                Hello, Frasier. 
Hello, Sam.                     

151
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,405
      I'd love to stay and talk 
      but I'm under a gag order.

152
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:32,774
        I'm sorry.              

153
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,475
I didn't realize you were       
    a friend of the Cranes.     

154
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,144
        I'm Sheila Rydell.      
            Oh, how do you do?  

155
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,745
        Dr. Rydell              
is a clinical psychiatrist      

156
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,814
    and also a fellow           
at the Boston University.       

157
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,649
      Oh, well, thank God       
 she's a woman here at Cheers.  

158
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,952
    ( <i>pager beeping</i> )           

159
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,087
  Doctors, excuse me a moment.  

160
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,288
I need to call a patient.       

161
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:48,689
Oh, yes, there's a phone        
right down the hall.            

162
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:49,991
    This will probably          
    take a few minutes          

163
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,192
so I'll meet you upstairs       
            shortly.            

164
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,010
             Fine.              

165
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,527
      Well, doctor, I have      

166
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,429
    a free phone right here.    

167
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,715
          I'm looking           
for a little more privacy.      

168
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,050
 I have a phone in my bedroom.  

169
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,319
                  Thank you, no.

170
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:05,339
FRASIER:                        
Honey bear, shall we?           

171
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,041
Oh, by the way, Sam.            

172
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,342
                    Yeah?       

173
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,712
Re: Doctor Rydell,              
I must say I concur completely. 

174
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,548
You know, most women            
who go into psychiatry          
are real bowsers,               

175
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:16,167
but, uh,                        

176
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,401
    I wouldn't kick her off     
        the couch               

177
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,502
 for eating crackers, you know? 

178
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,940
    Frasier, I can hear you,    
 and so can your unborn child.  

179
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,749
Will he be able                 
to escape from this one?        

180
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,150
Let's watch.                    

181
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,969
What I meant to say was, um,    

182
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,904
please, please, please          
forgive me. And, um...          

183
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:37,738
do you think we have time       

184
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:39,023
to stop by Tiffany's            
on the way home?                

185
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,191
                    Good boy.   

186
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,450
        Boy, I tell you,        
    I want that woman.          

187
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:53,170
      Sam, she's carrying       
    Dr. Crane's baby.           

188
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,792
No, no, not that woman.         

189
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,426
The woman                       
over by the phone.              

190
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,512
          Oh, well, who doesn't?

191
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:03,080
                Hubba, hubba.   

192
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,549
                            Sam.
            Yeah?               

193
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,951
    Mr. Cool, I hate to burst   
    your bubble again,          

194
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,887
             but didn't she just
             shoot you down?    

195
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,955
        Hey, maybe you should   
        just stay away          
        from brunettes.         

196
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,123
                      Except me,

197
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,690
        of course.              

198
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,791
    Yeah.                       

199
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,693
  No, no, don't you see here?   

200
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,062
     The good doctor and I      
          are sparing.          

201
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,930
      It's sexy, it's fun.      

202
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,198
     Just like one of those     

203
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:23,434
    old Spencer Tracy-          
     Audrey Hepburn movies.     

204
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,419
        Sammy, would you step   
        in my office, please?   

205
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,320
             A word in your ear.

206
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,039
You know, if I were you,        

207
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,542
I'd approach                    
the good Dr. Legs there         

208
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,309
on a professional level.        

209
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,211
            I would make an     
            appointment with her

210
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,681
        and pretend there was   
        something wrong with me.

211
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,651
            Cliffie,            
that's a pretty good idea.      

212
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,120
Yeah, who gave it to you?       

213
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,606
                      It's mine.

214
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:47,875
              It, uh, came right
              from this brain.  

215
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,828
Hey, everybody,                 
Clavin got a new brain.         

216
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,415
     So what do you think?      

217
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,585
Uh... What kind of problem      
    should I make up?           

218
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:58,919
Well, uh, how about this?       

219
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:01,488
I once took one of my kids      
to the school psychiatrist      

220
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,290
      and he said the kid       
        had kleptomania.        

221
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:03,941
Anything come of it?            

222
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:04,992
      Got a couple of pens      

223
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,910
and a leather appointment book. 

224
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,130
Yeah, or you could try          
using my problem.               

225
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:12,599
I've always had this terrible   
fear of being a failure.        

226
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,151
You are a failure.              

227
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,821
Well, then I've licked it.      

228
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:24,829
Wait a minute,                  
wait a minute.                  

229
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,830
I've got a suggestion.          

230
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,098
This is surefire.               

231
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,400
It's going to get you           
where you really want her.      

232
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:30,768
        Impotence.              

233
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,536
        Ooh-ooh-ooh, no.        

234
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,225
No, that's a word us guys       
don't even like to say.         

235
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,428
Wait a minute, take it from me. 

236
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,897
    We women are pushovers      
    for this kind of stuff.     

237
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,833
Hey, there are two things       
     that women like to do      

238
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,168
    more than anything else     
         in the world.          

239
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,137
    And one of them is          
  to cure a guy of impotence.   

240
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,555
What's the other thing?         

241
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,891
      Give it to him again      
    if he gets out of line.     

242
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,280
        No, I tell you,         

243
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:01,348
          I don't care          
     how hot that lady is.      

244
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,918
That's... I just couldn't       
say something like that to her. 

245
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,350
             Okay, so I tell her
             that I'm impotent. 

246
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,265
          Mr. Malone.           

247
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,070
              Oh, it is the same
              Sam Malone.       

248
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,371
         I hope this is         
     a professional visit.      

249
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,340
    Oh, I'm sad to say yes.     

250
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,911
        Doctor, I need to       
        unburden myself here,   

251
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,547
          and I figured that you
          were the one person   

252
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,182
          maybe I could talk to.

253
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,166
        Of course.              

254
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,550
        Sit down.               

255
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:12,753
      Now take your time.       

256
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,822
 Tell me what's troubling you.  

257
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,011
Well, Doctor, as you know,      
I'm a young, healthy male.      

258
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,714
      But recently I've...      

259
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:26,717
    Oh, heck, I'm not going     
 to mince words with you here.  

260
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:31,539
 Lately I haven't been able to  
get the old evan root cranking. 

261
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:37,561
        Excuse me?              

262
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,666
  Um, well, it's like... uh...  

263
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,567
  it's like my favorite shirt   

264
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:47,070
is a little light in the starch.

265
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:50,474
     Are you trying to say      
     that you're impotent?      

266
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,092
         No, don't, oh,         
      don't use that word.      

267
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,911
        Oh, I see.              

268
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,846
         Yes, well, uh,         

269
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:58,699
        arousal dysfunction is  
        a fairly common problem,

270
00:11:58,767 --> 00:11:59,767
                but it can be   

271
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,653
 very, very, very distressing.  

272
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,938
        Oh, it is.              

273
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,473
             It is.             

274
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,762
     How does this problem      
    usually manifest itself?    

275
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,998
      Oh, it's too painful      
         to talk about.         

276
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,500
I could demonstrate if you like.

277
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,252
         No, thank you.         

278
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
 No, no, you're probably right. 

279
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,789
  With my luck, it would work,  
          you know...           

280
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,542
  Like when you take your car   
  to the mechanic, you know.    

281
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,963
     Of course, this isn't      
     my field of expertise,     

282
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,331
      but you're in luck.       

283
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,402
            My associate,       
            Dr. Heimlich Mueller

284
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,704
            is conducting       
            a group session     
            at this very moment.

285
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,006
             I'm sure he'd agree
             to let you join in.

286
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:41,258
 Actually I was kind of hoping  
that you could handle it.       

287
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,893
     Oh, don't feel uneasy      
    about Dr. Mueller.          

288
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,995
Those charges linking him       
         to the Gestapo         

289
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,564
were grossly exaggerated.       

290
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,715
        Excuse me?              

291
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:49,866
  He was merely a consultant.   

292
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,904
Actually, his technique         
is somewhat controversial.      

293
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:55,522
You'll have to go in there      
          and proclaim          

294
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,957
      your sexual disorder      
         to the group.          

295
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,792
    You want me to say that     
    in front of other people?   

296
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,595
Oh, there are only a half dozen 
men in there just like yourself,

297
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:04,264
and of course the 20 or 30      
    observing nurses.           

298
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,969
Just go in there, stand up      
    and say "I'm Sam Malone,    

299
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,505
        and I no longer         
      function as a man."       

300
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:13,858
            No! No, no!         
            Wait, wait, wait.   

301
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,242
Oh, no, no, I'm...              

302
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,711
Listen, there's been            
a misunderstanding here.        

303
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,713
I didn't say "impotent,"        
I said "impudent."              

304
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,515
Yeah, I'm a smart ass.          

305
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,167
See?                            

306
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:26,336
There's nothing wrong           
with me, no, ma'am.             

307
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,704
     Then the cure worked.      

308
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,206
        That'll be $150.        

309
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,541
      Pay the receptionist      

310
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,492
                on your way out.

311
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:36,597
    Oh... You-you've been...    
you've been putting me on.      

312
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:39,650
 And that was very unfair of me 
          considering           

313
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,852
how honest you were being.      

314
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:47,792
    All right, I admit that     
I was making up that stuff      

315
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:51,361
 just because, well, you're...  
    a beautiful woman           

316
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,196
    and I just wanted to see    
     a little more of you,      

317
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,433
          that's all.           

318
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,468
                    I see.      

319
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:04,007
          Well, actually, that's
          kind of flattering.   

320
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:06,677
Not very many men would come in 
 here and humiliate themselves  

321
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:08,812
         and tell some          
     childish, idiotic lie      

322
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,248
just to spend five minutes      
            with me.            

323
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:14,718
        I'm a romantic.         

324
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,089
      So what do you say,       
 you want to go out to dinner?  

325
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:23,277
     I suppose I could use      
 a bit more romance in my life. 

326
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,761
    All right, great.           

327
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,131
         I'll call you,         
      next week sometime.       

328
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,899
How about tomorrow night?       
             Great.             

329
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,085
That's good, that's good.       
All right.                      

330
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,804
Yeah, thanks very much. Ha.     

331
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,557
        ( <i>tape rewinds</i> )        

332
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,960
        Um... excuse me.        
        See, I...               

333
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,379
You didn't have that            
tape recorder on, did you,      

334
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:45,015
when I was making up            
that stuff about imp...         

335
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,216
            Don't worry, Sam.   

336
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:47,484
 The moment you walked in here  

337
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,019
  I was aware you were faking   
        the whole thing         

338
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,454
 and I turned the recorder off. 

339
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,539
        Oh, good.               
     Well, thank goodness.      

340
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:55,442
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

341
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,661
 And I turned the intercom on.  

342
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,166
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

343
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:09,106
Okay, boys,                     
closing time.                   

344
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,374
    Let's move on out.          

345
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,243
Probably want to go home,       
         get some rest,         

346
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,778
          so you can be back for
          your 9:00 a.m. shift. 

347
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,947
          It's one of those days
          I hate to see end,    

348
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:18,382
        you know what I mean?   
     Mm-hmm.                    

349
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,716
                 Hey, I got some
                 new videos.    

350
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:21,152
             You guys want to   
             come over my place?

351
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,270
    New videos, great.          
                    Yeah, yeah, 

352
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:25,789
     Ma had our home movies     
    converted to tape.          

353
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,359
    There's a great one of me   
    all dressed up as Peter Pan.

354
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,294
              Ma's Captain Hook,
              she's tying me up.

355
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,428
         ( <i>chuckles</i> ):          
          It's great.           

356
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:32,662
             For Halloween, huh?

357
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,531
No, no, it's a little game      
        we used to play         

358
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,665
    to help me sleep.           

359
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,534
          You know how          
      crazy teenagers are.      

360
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,827
Well, Sheila, why don't you     
hop up to the bar there,        

361
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,063
          I'll fix us           
    a little nightcap.          

362
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,732
      Oh, Sammy, you mind       
      if I take off early?      

363
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,751
 I want to put the little ones  
     to bed myself tonight.     

364
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,652
Put them to bed?                
Hey, it's 2:00 a.m.             

365
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,622
          Oh, right, they're    
          probably not home yet.

366
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,260
 Ah, well, I'll get some sleep. 

367
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,930
Hey, listen, don't forget       
to put up the barstools.        

368
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,497
     Don't worry about it.      
    We'll do it later.          

369
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,866
        I hope so.              

370
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,635
         But take care          
      of the stools, too.       

371
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,792
Sam, I had a really lovely time 
    with you tonight.           

372
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,661
        Well, you sound         
      a little surprised.       

373
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,663
      Well, I am a little.      

374
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,965
    I guess a lot of the men    
         I go out with          

375
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,334
  tend to be a little stuffy.   

376
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,271
     But you're so relaxed      
     and easy to be with.       

377
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:34,008
  And I must admit, I've never  
  seen a man do a puppet show   

378
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,076
with lobster claws before.      

379
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:39,046
         Well, you were         
    a lovely audience.          

380
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,581
        Thank you.              

381
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:43,700
Hey, and thank you for not      
 coming on like a psychiatrist. 

382
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:45,769
      What does that mean?      

383
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,855
     Well, I know you guys      
 always have your meter going.  

384
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,723
And I was afraid you were       
     sitting there thinking     

385
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,626
      all sorts of weird,       
     head-shrinking things.     

386
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:53,927
    Well, as a professional,    

387
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,863
 you learn to keep those things 
          to yourself.          

388
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:01,635
            So you were thinking
            those things?       

389
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:07,007
Sam, I really prefer to divorce 
    business from pleasure.     

390
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,943
            Absolutely.         
            No, you're right.   

391
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:12,546
        Were they bad things?   

392
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,816
      Sam, I really think       
         it's a mistake         

393
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,651
     to pursue this matter      
          any further.          

394
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,386
        Oh, great.              
  I bet you wouldn't say that   

395
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:20,888
      if you were thinking      
          good things.          

396
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,655
                  I mean,       
                  you'd probably

397
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,708
  come right out and say it if  
you were sitting there thinking,

398
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,543
        "Whoa, you know,        
  this guy is really together   

399
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:29,045
 and I'm lucky to be with him,  
      and boy, the hair."       

400
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,750
            So come on, tell me.

401
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,018
Really, Sam, no.                

402
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,219
                  Hey, come on, 
                  I can take it.

403
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,488
                It'll be fun.   

404
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,690
      Sam, would you just       
    please drop the subject?    

405
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:42,075
             Okay.              

406
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,795
     Boy, you brain benders     

407
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,096
 are all the same, aren't you?  

408
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:47,381
                I mean, you want

409
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,715
two years of a guy's life       

410
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:50,217
    and every penny he earns    

411
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,485
      before you give him       
  one little simple diagnosis.  

412
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:54,421
    You know, I think           
    you're full of blabber.     

413
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,390
     I don't think you know     
    anything about me.          

414
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,358
         I think I do.          

415
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,026
      Yeah? Then why don't      
          you tell me.          

416
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:02,996
 All right, Sam, if you insist. 

417
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:05,682
                        I do.   

418
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,051
My professional                 
opinion of you                  

419
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:11,722
  is that your every thought,   
         word and deed          

420
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,690
      revolves around sex.      

421
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,478
     You have nothing else      
         in your life.          

422
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:21,899
     Without constant sex,      
 you'd probably just shrivel up 

423
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,285
         into a little,         
     dried anchovy and die.     

424
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,338
      Well, who wouldn't?       

425
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,057
              I mean, that's it?

426
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,528
                No bad stuff?   

427
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:38,432
Sam, there's nothing            
but bad stuff.                  

428
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,034
    You're an aging lothario    

429
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:44,488
    who uses sex to cover up    
      massive insecurity,       

430
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,259
    a fear of true intimacy,    
     fear of a relationship     

431
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,628
    and quite frankly,          
not only a fear of dying,       

432
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,263
but a fear of living, too.      

433
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,898
    You're one sick cowpoke.    

434
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:59,486
                  I resent that.

435
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,521
             You know, you were 
             shoveling down that
             lobster tonight    

436
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,590
                  like there was
                  no tomorrow.  

437
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,526
     You know, you even ate     
        the green stuff         

438
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:07,194
 and this is the thanks I get?  

439
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:08,995
Sam, you forced me to tell you. 

440
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:10,497
What did you want me to do, lie?

441
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,132
                 Of course, yes.

442
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,068
    Oh, Sam, come on.           

443
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,770
    Why don't we just           
     forget the whole thing     

444
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:18,439
and go back to my place?        

445
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,540
                        What?   

446
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,107
                  You still want
                  to go to bed, 

447
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,943
                 even though sex
                 is supposedly  

448
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,611
              the only thing    
              I have in my life?

449
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,680
    Exactly.                    

450
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,351
And so I assume                 
you're rather good at it.       

451
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:37,157
          You would actually    
          have sex with somebody

452
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,859
         you don't even respect?

453
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:41,462
Isn't that what                 
you do with women?              

454
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:43,730
        Yeah, but I cover it up.

455
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,669
I mean, how long have you       
lived in America, lady?         

456
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,554
    Oh, Sam, come on.           

457
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,957
      No, listen, I think       
you ought to take a hike.       

458
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,392
      I'll tell you what,       
         send me a bill         

459
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,995
for another hundred and a half, 
I'll deduct the lobster.        

460
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,119
Well, I'm sorry                 
if this was painful,            

461
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:11,591
but maybe it was good           
for you to have heard it.       

462
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,894
By the way, if you change       
your mind about the sex,        

463
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:17,697
I can be beeped anytime.        

464
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:20,133
      That's so pathetic!       

465
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,770
              Oh!               

466
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,273
        ( <i>groans</i> )              

467
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,841
              Oh!               

468
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,700
      Are you locking up?       

469
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,286
 Hey, let me ask you something. 

470
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:42,923
  Do you think that my life is  
 empty and void of any meaning? 

471
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,990
              Yep.              

472
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,626
    Don't forget to lock up.    

473
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,880
            Oh, b...            

474
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,455
         Tough night on         
    the dating circuit, Sam?    

475
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,290
             Oh...              

476
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:01,692
    Do you believe... my...     

477
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,827
My date told me that there      
     was nothing in my life     

478
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:08,164
      except women or sex.      

479
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,967
          By the way,           
     you look hot tonight.      

480
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,406
         Come on, Sam,          
 you have a lot going for you.  

481
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:16,807
             Yeah?              

482
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,141
        Like what?              

483
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:22,545
        There's...              

484
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,097
Ooh, I could go on and on.      

485
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,465
See you later, Sam.             

486
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,500
         Wait a minute.         
 Come on, answer the question.  

487
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:30,871
What do I have in my life       
that isn't women or sex?        

488
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:34,407
Come on, Sam,                   
you're a passionate guy.        

489
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:37,611
 I bet you have a lot of things 
  that you care deeply about.   

490
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,779
        Yeah, like what?        

491
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,282
        Your job.               

492
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,651
It's a great way to meet babes. 

493
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,270
    You love your car.          

494
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:49,339
         Babes love it.         

495
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,007
            Sailing.            

496
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:54,044
        Babes on waves.         

497
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,914
              See?              

498
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:00,483
Then the doctor was right,      
    I'm a shallow guy.          

499
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,652
    I mean, everything I do     
      is to impress women       

500
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,288
    or revolves around sex.     

501
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,657
        I guess I'm nothing more

502
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:11,895
            than a hot, manly   
            machine of love.    

503
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,997
Um, uh...                       

504
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:16,083
        Sam, wait.              
    What about the Stooges?     

505
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,585
    They're all right,          
    they're over at Cliff's.    

506
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:22,539
          No, no, Sam.          
 What about the Three Stooges?  

507
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,308
        Oh, yeah, great.        
I like the Three Stooges.       

508
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,676
    That helps a lot.           

509
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,243
Wait a minute, Sam.             
Think about this.               

510
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,780
Do women like                   
the Three Stooges?              

511
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,147
             No, they hate them.

512
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,549
All right.                      

513
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,051
    Are women impressed that    
  you like the Three Stooges?   

514
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,022
        No, some of them        
even think they're stupid.      

515
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,424
      When you're watching      
    the Three Stooges,          

516
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:42,893
do you think they're sexy?      

517
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,162
    No, when you watch          
    the Three Stooges,          

518
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:48,531
    nobody has time to think    
      about sex or women.       

519
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,954
      Hey, wait a minute.       

520
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:57,424
            That means          
            I do have another   
            interest in my life.

521
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,960
              I like the Stooges
              for themselves.   

522
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:03,580
            Hey, whoa, I'm okay.

523
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,316
            Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!   

524
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,551
              ( <i>imitates Curly</i> )

525
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,554
That's fine, Sam.               

526
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:11,788
        Come here, porcupine.   

527
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:12,822
( <i>squeals</i> )                     

528
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,058
Knock it off.                   
                Come on, try it,

529
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,893
                 you'll like it.
                 Come on, do it.

530
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,761
All right.                      

531
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:20,930
                There you go.   

532
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:24,634
Come here, porcupine.           

533
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:26,102
         ( <i>loud smack</i> )         
              SAM:              
              <i>Ooh.</i>              

534
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,088
  <i>Hey, the Stooges don't bleed.</i>
