00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,034
SAM TURNS THE OTHER CHEEK

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,988
- l'm sorry it has to be like this.
- Why?

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,111
Back up the garbage truck, Cliffie.
Entering Dump City.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,271
Have a little sensitivity.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,353
That living, feeling human being
is about to be blown out of the water.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,195
You want to stand aside?
l can't see anything here.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,148
Sam, l know it's my fault.
l should have said something sooner.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,471
l'm sorry, it's just that l told you,
it's a rule with me.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,110
lt's the right thing to do.
l think we both realise that.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,236
- l suppose you're right.
- Yes.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,790
- Don't you think that if we worked...
- Let's make a clean break.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,954
Stop now and we'll still have all those
terrific memories. Now go, go.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,078
- Don't make it any tougher.
- Goodbye, Sam.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,389
Goodbye.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,110
Available in paperback
wherever nauseating trash is sold.

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,270
You want to tell me what was wrong
with that one, Sammy?

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,035
- She looked perfect. Body was a ten.
- So was her face.

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,156
So was her lQ.

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,390
Sam's kind of girl.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,755
She was married.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,152
She told me just now.
l don't mess around with married women.

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,276
Me neither.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,429
lt's refreshing to know
you draw the line somewhere.

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,310
There are three categories
of women l don't get involved with -

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,472
married, underage, and comatose.

26
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,677
He's added one.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,197
- Sam, may l have my purse, please?
- What are you grinning about?

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,310
l was just confirming what a fortunate
thing it was that you and l split up.

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,316
Now my love life is stable
and yours belongs in one.

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,589
l'll have to share that with Frasier.
Puns are his greatest pleasure.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,718
Now that he's sleeping with you?

32
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,591
Carla, that was a mean-spirited,
tasteless insult.

33
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,593
- Why aren't you chortling?
- Leave me alone.

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,275
l've got the worst toothache
in the history of the world.

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,113
Must be an impacted wisdom fang!

36
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,311
Die! You're going to die!

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,792
Why don't you do with a toothache
what l did when l played in the minors?

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,599
- What's that, Coach?
- See a dentist.

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,073
You're right, Coach.
l'll have to go tomorrow.

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,879
l got my bad dental habits
from my parents.

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,191
They taught me to brush after every war.

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,635
Coach, how about one for the road?

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,395
So, Normie, how's Vera doing?

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,757
She's all right,
but she's nagging to get a new house.

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,673
Having any luck in finding one?

46
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,229
We've got to get rid of the old one first.

47
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,233
l've been thinking
about getting another place.

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,359
- lt's yours.
- l'd like to take a look at it first.

49
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,114
The man's a shrewd buyer, Coach.

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,397
- What's wrong with where you're living?
- Nothing, really.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,552
l just thought it's time
l got a place of my own.

52
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,429
- Where do you live now?
- You know where l live.

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,276
- No, l've never been there.
- l...live at home.

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,069
- At home? Whose home?
- My parents'. No big deal. Good night.

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,518
Parents?
You live with mommy and daddy?

56
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,911
- l... l live with my mother, Norm.
- For what?

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,629
lt's not out of choice.
lt's more of a sense of responsibility.

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,078
My father abandoned us
and l've become the man of the house.

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,391
- You've got a curfew?
- Curfew! Come on, Norm.

60
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,030
l can stay out as long as l call by ten.

61
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,191
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Coach.

62
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,868
- l'm sorry, we're closed.
- That's OK. l'm not a customer.

63
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,271
- l'm looking for Sam Malone.
- You found him.

64
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,477
l'm Maxine's husband.

65
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,315
Not the Sam Malone, a Sam Malone.

66
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,995
- Not the one you're looking for though.
- Why did you do it?

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,790
Now, wait, wait! You just listen to me.
l did not know that she was married.

68
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,589
She just told me today,
and the second l found out, l called it off.

69
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,390
That was it. Ask her. l may have done
a lot of lousy things in my life,

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,393
but l don't mess around
with other men's wives.

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,112
- You're saying it's all her fault?
- l'm not saying it's anybody's fault.

72
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,113
lt was just a big mistake, that's all.

73
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,471
l know we've all been hurt
by this...and l'm sorry.

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,716
What am l doing? Who am l kidding?

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,871
She's a tramp.

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,670
l think l've always known it
and l've never admitted it.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,839
You got anything to drink?

78
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,636
l think l got a bottle here, someplace.

79
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,034
- Scotch all right?
- Yes. bring it over, will you?

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,948
You're not a mean drunk, are you?

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,720
No, just a stupid one. Don't flatter
yourself thinking that you're the first.

82
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,750
- There have been others.
- Out of curiosity, are they still with us?

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,271
- lf she just weren't so damn gorgeous.
- Yes, l know.

84
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,151
lt's tough being married
to a beautiful woman.

85
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,871
You know,
tis like that sweet old love ballad says...

86
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,872
''lf you want to be happy
for the rest of your life

87
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,077
''Never make a pretty woman your wife

88
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,438
''From my personal point of view
get an ugly girl to marry you''

89
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,520
- Remember that?
- l should have listened!

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,119
l'm really sorry, Sam.
l've been out of my mind.

91
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,276
- Women! Look what they bring us to.
- They put you through hell, don't they?

92
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,557
- l get the feeling they enjoy it, too.
- Yes.

93
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,837
Why don't l hold on to this?

94
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,950
Put it someplace where
it's not going to do any damage.

95
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,358
l wish l hadn't done that.

96
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,157
- Hey, everybody! Great day, isn't it?
- Did you get your tooth fixed?

97
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,996
l am never going to be afraid
to go to the dentist again.

98
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,958
l've found a way
to communicate with him.

99
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,396
As he leaned in with his drill...

100
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,838
l grabbed him
where l could get his attention

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,232
and l said, ''We're not going
to hurt each other, are we?''

102
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,990
- All right.
- Carla?

103
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,559
- Did that work?
- We're having a late dinner.

104
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,432
- Sam! What the hell happened to you?
- Nothing, really. Nothing at all.

105
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,354
What do you mean?
You come limping in with a cane.

106
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,389
There was a little trouble in the bar
last night, but it was no big deal.

107
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,073
What happened, Sam? Come on.

108
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,112
A thief broke in...l had to run him out...

109
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,477
and...l caught a bullet in the...leg here.

110
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,474
- A bullet in the leg!
- Come on, it's no big deal.

111
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,279
Let's just go back to our business.

112
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,394
Good Lord, Sam, you grappled
with an armed marauder?

113
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,837
- You could have lost your life!
- Well, l guess l could have.

114
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,912
But that's something
you only think about afterwards.

115
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,753
Talk about guts!

116
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,755
lt had nothing to do with guts, Norm.
lt's just reflex. l am an athlete.

117
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,070
Let's hear it for Mayday. Another save?

118
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,197
- Will you sit down here?
- No, l think l'll stand.

119
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,193
Sam, you should give us some details.

120
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,436
Details? All right, that's easy enough.

121
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,871
Well, Coach...these guys
burst into the bar and they...

122
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,110
l thought it was just one guy.

123
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,116
No, l just said one guy
had a gun...that l saw.

124
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,239
They could have all had guns,
but when they saw what l did to their pal,

125
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,914
they just took off out of there.

126
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,595
- Basically, they were all cowards.
- Amen to that, Sammy.

127
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,036
All right, Coach.
The guy was holding his gun on me

128
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,594
and l waited for the right moment
and then l kicked out with my leg,

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,197
kind of like... l guess the closest
comparison would be Bruce Lee.

130
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,113
l made contact with the gun,

131
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,717
he pulled the trigger, the bullet caught
my leg and the gun went flying.

132
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,916
And the rest just took off out of there.

133
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,310
Big save!

134
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,070
Come on! l guess l really shouldn't
have done it, but l'll tell you something.

135
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,438
The next time one of those drunk,
drugged-out punks decide to break in

136
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,913
and take advantage of an honest citizen,
they'll think twice about it, l'll tell you.

137
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,829
- You guys!
- Just like the old days, Sam?

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,594
Where are you going, Mayday?

139
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,637
Well, l can still dance on it!

140
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,793
l think there's something rotten
in the state of Denmark.

141
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,394
lt's all that cheese.

142
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,799
- Sam, when you say in the leg...
- All right, so it wasn't exactly the leg.

143
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,114
- lt was a little higher up.
- The important thing is that you're OK.

144
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,319
But exactly how did they manage
to shoot you in the ''l know what''?

145
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,875
When you're surrounded by marauders
with automatic weapons, the bullets...

146
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,233
When my husband left last night
with a gun, l never thought he would...

147
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,235
Why think of something
that had nothing to do with me!

148
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,559
l've got a question for you. Whatever
happened to the metric system?

149
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,759
Weren't we supposed to change
all those measuring cups?

150
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,357
That was your act of heroism?
Mayday's moment of truth?

151
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,751
Shot in the fanny while fleeing
a jealous husband.

152
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,354
Wait! Who said l was running away?

153
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,833
How else do you explain
the location of your wound?

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,552
l could have been coming at him and
turned a somersault to throw off his aim.

155
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,871
You're lucky
that you didn't get brain damage.

156
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,188
All right, let's get our facts straight.
l did not know she was married.

157
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,794
And l was not running away,

158
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,317
l was putting the gun
in my back pocket when it went off.

159
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,117
This is a perfect comment
on your lifestyle.

160
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,236
- Answer me one question.
- What?

161
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,678
When you went to the doctor,
did you ask him to get the lead out?

162
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,674
- Frasier will love that one, won't he?
- Frasier's weekend is made.

163
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,597
Come on, no jokes.
Just do me one favour.

164
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
l will not change your dressing.

165
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,349
No, listen, just back me up on this?
lf everybody finds out what happened...

166
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,593
They might make you
the butt of their jokes.

167
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,039
- l'll save that one for his birthday.
- Just promise me, will you?

168
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,589
Just don't say anything.

169
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,919
Sure, Sam. l won't blow your story
but l must warn you...

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,278
The bigger the lie, the bigger
the fool one might appear later to be.

171
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,874
Well, whatever.

172
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,271
The thing is that
l did get a little carried away,

173
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,989
but there's no harm done
and it's all over. So, let's just forget it.

174
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,836
Sam? There's a film crew
from the six o'clock news out here.

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,195
Gee, l wonder what they want?

176
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,556
Cliffie, are you going to buy
Norm's house or not?

177
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,439
You bet, Coach. Don't tell him l said so,

178
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,469
but the building inspector who checked
it out says his house is in terrific shape.

179
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,596
Coach, draft, please.

180
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,832
Why wouldn't you tell him
a thing like that?

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,834
The guy is hot to sell.
l'm going to low-ball him on this one

182
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,754
and he's going to end up
looking like a giant sap.

183
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,673
Clifford! l can't believe my ears.

184
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,231
Gee, and l've never believed
your hair or your nose.

185
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,198
What does that leave us?

186
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,397
You would take advantage
of your best friend?

187
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,711
Friendship has its place,
but not in business.

188
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,270
Especially in real estate
where it's strictly dog-eat-dog.

189
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,035
One fidoburger coming up!

190
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,635
Norm!
Could l have your ear for a second?

191
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,794
Despite my building inspector's protest,
l've decided to put a bid on your house.

192
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,033
There it is.
That's going have to be my top offer.

193
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,398
- You got yourself a deal!
- Hey! What?

194
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,030
- Everybody, l sold the house!
- Normie sold the house.

195
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,158
l can look at
that place with the pool room.

196
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,517
- That's an eight there.
- An eight! l thought it was a two!

197
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,989
At last, English-speaking neighbours.

198
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,230
What don't l know about this house?

199
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,234
- The market value.
- That paper's not notarised, Norm.

200
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,518
lt was an honour
meeting Boston's newest hero.

201
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,797
Did anybody ever tell you
you were like Gary Cooper?

202
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,748
- Yup!
- Good night. Great place.

203
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,718
- Thanks very much.
- What a night!

204
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,269
200 bucks in tips!

205
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,798
- What will you do with all that money?
- l'm going spend it all on my kids.

206
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,518
Good girl!

207
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,390
How many gunny sacks and one-way
tickets do you think it'll buy?

208
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
Gee, l don't know, Carla.

209
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,272
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Never mind.

210
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,273
Come on. What's the problem?

211
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,193
You're living a lie, Sam.

212
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,911
l know you won't listen to me but
our parents were right when they said,

213
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,230
''No one profits by deceit.''

214
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,714
Sorry, Diane, tonight's receipts are
making too much noise. l can't hear you.

215
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,238
l honestly don't care what you do,
but l must say l'm a little disappointed.

216
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,472
You're sure
you don't want to hang around,

217
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,996
get naked and roll
around in all my money?

218
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,598
You're no fun any more.

219
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,033
- Hello again, Sam.
- Hello, Marvin.

220
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,430
How are you doing?

221
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,478
- This thing has turned out good for you.
- Yeah.

222
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,870
l saw you on TV.

223
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,670
There you were, the scum
who was messing around with my wife.

224
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,516
- And they're treating you like a hero.
- You want to stop pointing guns at me?

225
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,150
Sam... Don't mind me,
just carry on as if l weren't here.

226
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,959
- You're not going anywhere.
- Come on, Marvin.

227
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,714
- Let her go.
- So she can call the police?

228
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,509
The police?
Obviously you don't know me.

229
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,468
There's too much government
interference in our lives as it is.

230
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,873
- Get back here.
- This is crazy. l was already shot once.

231
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,511
- We're even.
- No, Sam, we're not even. Not yet.

232
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,437
l can't sleep, l can't eat, l can't work!
All l can think about is you and my wife...

233
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,036
Diane, isn't that a run in your stocking?

234
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,751
My! You're right! What a nasty run.
Look at that.

235
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,195
Just put some nail polish on it.

236
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,230
l don't think nail polish will work on a run
this large and high up on one's thigh.

237
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,039
- Do you, Marvin?
- Look, shut up!

238
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,394
Just working a cramp out. There you go.

239
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,679
- You'd better not try that again.
- Don't worry.

240
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,230
- Move over here.
- Excuse me, Marvin?

241
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,951
Listen to me. You're having trouble
with your marriage, aren't you?

242
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,673
- Believe me, l understand how you feel.
- Nobody understands how l feel.

243
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,752
- l do!
- Sure, sure!

244
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,515
- You ever been in love with trash?
- Yes!

245
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,873
This disgusting pile right here.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,072
Exactly. He's trash.

247
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,030
But l...love him with all my heart.

248
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,114
Why?

249
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,280
Because...l've got to.

250
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,271
You tell me. Why do you love her?
Because neither one of us can help it.

251
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,834
But l'm asking you as a favour from one
sucker to another, don't waste my fella.

252
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,879
- Sam, is this true? You and her?
- Yeah, absolutely.

253
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,956
- l don't deserve her, but who does?
- And what do we get for loving them?

254
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,238
A punch in the face, a kick in the gut,
a one-way ticket to Heartbreak City.

255
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,278
He's a stockbroker.
Why are you talking like that?

256
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,150
Lady, you're right.
You know exactly how l feel.

257
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,710
The biggest favour
l could do for this lady is to shoot you.

258
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,190
Way to go, sweetheart.
Actually, we're not that close.

259
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,238
- Just an occasional movie date.
- l won't shoot you.

260
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,712
You know why? Because
it would hurt her more than it would you.

261
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,475
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

262
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,199
lf you ever get tired of him
and you want someone

263
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,559
who can give you a nice,
quiet home life, think of me.

264
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,234
Mighty attractive offer.

265
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,919
l don't believe this. You just saved
my life with that ridiculous story.

266
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,755
l'm not sure l know
what to do to thank you.

267
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,869
l can think of something.
But l don't think you're prepared to do it.

268
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,316
Come on, of course l am.
Let's just go in my office here.

269
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,758
Unfortunately, l'm injured, so you're
going to have to do most of the work.

270
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,076
- Good night, Sam.
- l was kidding!

271
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,276
l know what you're thinking about.

272
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,399
You want me to set the record straight
about what happened the other night.

273
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,596
Right?

274
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,716
All right, l will.

275
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,758
l'm going to call
the newspaper right now.

276
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,878
- l didn't ask you to do that.
- l know, but l'm going to.

277
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,319
This is important. Because
your respect for me is important to me.

278
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,600
l always pretend it isn't, but the truth is,
l want you to think l'm a good person.

279
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,393
- Really, Sam?
- Really.

280
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,991
Sometimes you surprise me, Mr Malone.

281
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,073
- And that's wonderful.
- Yeah.

282
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,593
Hello,
can l speak to the City Desk, please?

283
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,716
ls anyone else in?

284
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,955
Who am l speaking to then?

285
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,071
All right, Emily, this is Sam Malone
and l'm calling because l...

286
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,920
You heard about that?

287
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,949
Listen, the thing is that a lot of people
have been making a big deal...

288
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,395
l'd like to meet you, too.

289
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,755
What time do you get off work?

290
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,480
No, 4:00 am, that's no problem for me.

291
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,116
That's great, yeah.

292
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,953
Well... Afraid?

293
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,999
Emily, l'd be lying
if l said that l wasn't, but the...

294
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,038
You're not married, are you?

295
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,915
English ( en)
