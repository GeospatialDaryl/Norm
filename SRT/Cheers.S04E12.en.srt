1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,630
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,472
What can I get you?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,477
What have you got?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,198
Anything you want.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,270
I'll bet you do.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,876
Why don't you tell me.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,235
Maybe you'd like to see a menu.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,632
No, I don't need one.
I know what I want.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,678
Are we talking about the same thing?

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,312
I think so.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,237
Then maybe you'd like to whisper
what you want in my ear.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,913
Scotch and soda?

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,598
He's toying with me.

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,239
Chased out of the pocket,
he's gonna throw it on the run,

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,674
it's incomplete.

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,277
Good Lord, Sam, isn't this the tenth
football game you've watched today?

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,069
It only seems that way.
That's the beauty of football.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,439
Sundays. The incessant drone
of the television,

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,070
the stench of beer
and monosyllabic conversation.

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,993
That's it. Get into it, girl.

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,950
Oh, Diane. Listen, I dropped by
to give you a bit of news.

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,759
I've decided to go away
for a while.

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,672
I just wanna collect my thoughts

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,798
and see if things look brighter
from a new perspective.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,235
Frasier, I think that's terrific news.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,392
A very positive step.
I'm so happy for you.

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,154
Well, thank you. I'm happy for myself.

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,110
Say, wait a second, Diane.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,511
Crazy notion just jumped into my head,
I don't know where it came from,

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,114
but I was wondering if
you'd like to come along.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,631
I mean, after all,
we do travel well together,

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,950
and we have that matching luggage.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,679
Frasier, I really don't think
that would be a good idea at all.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,597
Of course. I understand.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,791
Oh, Diane. I've been putting off telling
you something, but I feel I must now.

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,838
You've been using the word
"really" far too frequently.

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,868
In fact, it's become really noticeable.

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,474
It's really quite maddening, really.

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,318
Frasier, I know you're disappointed
that I didn't accept your invitation,

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,031
but I really-- I don't think that's
any reason to get on my case.

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,159
"Get on my case."
What a charming bit of slang.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,394
Frasier, nitpicking at my choice
of the correct modern English

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,471
does not make you
any more attractive to me.

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,877
If that's the purpose in your visits here,
perhaps you should find another tavern

45
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,349
in which to bore the life
out of the clientele.

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,398
I'm so sorry to disappoint you,
Miss God's-Gift-to-Men.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,199
It just so happens that I come here
to share the companionship

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,875
of my male friends. So, men,
what's on the agenda tonight?

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,430
- Football.
- Oh, good Lord.

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,553
I mean, "Rah."

51
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,673
Using a colloquialism to ingratiate
yourself with the rabble?

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,515
How very sad.
How really very sad.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,154
Did you see that bootleg by Montana?
The guy's unstoppable.

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,436
Woody, looks like you're
gonna win the bar pool today.

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,875
The Rams still have a chance,
and if they make a comeback,

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,350
- I take the pool.
- Woody, you know, if you win this,

57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,988
that's gonna make three weeks
straight you've been in the money.

58
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,833
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on a streak.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,036
You know, I've always been
a lucky guy.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,633
Back home I won a haircut.

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,198
The heck kind of contest was that?

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,670
Well, it wasn't really a contest.
It was just policy.

63
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,593
See, if the barber nicks your ear,
you get a free haircut.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,278
I think Schopenhauer put it aptly
when he said:

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,035
"Noise is the most contemptuous
of all forms of interruption. It is--"

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,316
Impertinent.

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,999
Excuse me?

68
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,549
What you were trying to say was:

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,918
"Noise is the most impertinent
of all forms of interruption."

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,230
She said "contemptuous,"
can you believe that?

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,676
I thought I'd have a conniption.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,638
Stop this quibbling at once.

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,439
As the only two entities
of any discernible intellect in this place,

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,431
it is our duty to set an example
for the others.

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,956
You're only saying that because
you know I'm smarter than you are.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,998
This from a man who mispronounced
"rémoulade" at a dinner party.

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,037
Diane, I am fed up
with the rémoulade incident!

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,111
- lsn't it true?
- You are totally overblowing it.

79
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,111
Hey, hey! Would you two cut it out.

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,953
You're drowning out a perfectly good
tire commercial.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,070
There's the gun. Final score: 24...

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,869
Yeah, all right. There's the final.
Looks like you won, Woodrow.

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,632
- Hey, Woody.
- Hey, Woodrow.

84
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,074
Thank you very much.

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,708
I want you to know I couldn't
have done it without all you guys

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,269
because, well, this is your money.

87
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,632
Here you go. Seventy-five big ones.
Paul, second place. Twenty-five.

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,678
You did good, kid, but I still think
I got a more reliable system.

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,558
Yeah? I could really use one.
What's yours?

90
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,792
I just bet opposite whatever you pick.

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,996
So, Woody, what's this system
you got up your sleeve there, huh?

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,071
- Yeah, Woody.
- Well, I don't actually have one.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,800
I just kind of look at the picks
and one team jumps out at me.

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,748
- He's got it down to a science.
- Really.

95
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,188
Imagine how much
he'd have made

96
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,793
if he'd parlayed some of those bets.

97
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,837
- What's that mean?
- Well, that's when you bet

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,514
a series of games with a bookie.
I mean, you gotta win them all,

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,071
- so the odds are pretty long.
- Do you guys know a real bookie?

100
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,954
I got a friend who's got a friend
who's got a friend.

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,510
- And he's a bookie?
- No, but his friend is.

102
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,677
Wow. You know, if I bet with a bookie,

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,274
I'd have something to tell my
grandchildren.

104
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,712
Sam, I don't think you should
encourage Woody

105
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,791
to pursue illegal activities.

106
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,714
Oh, lighten up, will you, Diane. It's
a part of a guy's passage into maturity.

107
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,429
You know, like going to a cathouse
or whizzing off a balcony...

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,592
...or mooning out of the back of a car.

109
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,036
Or on a really good night, all three.

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,590
- Yes, the triple.
- Triple.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,278
Hey, why don't we-- Yeah, good idea.

112
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,113
I got the schedule for
next week's games here.

113
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,069
Anything jumping out at you?

114
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,830
Oh, yeah! These are the strongest
feelings I've had yet.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,911
- Well, what? What do you got?
- What's up?

116
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,119
All right. Indianapolis, Tampa Bay,

117
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,157
Buffalo just hit me right in the eye.
Houston.

118
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,117
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Yeah, I'll bet it did.

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,113
- What's so funny?
- All those teams you picked,

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,157
they're a long shot, Woody.
He doesn't even know

121
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,788
- what the point spreads are.
- What difference does that make?

122
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,076
I haven't looked at
the point spreads all year.

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,028
Hey, Sam, I'd like to bet these teams
with your bookie.

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,749
Okay. All right. How much you
wanna put down? Twenty, 30 bucks?

125
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,115
Thousand dollars.

126
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,952
You own $1 000?

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,951
Yes, ma'am, it's all my savings.

128
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,918
Woody, I'm not gonna let you throw
away all your money on gambling.

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,038
You know, Woody, all that money
on one shot, you gotta be nuts.

130
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,839
Yeah, why don't you sit down
and give it a little thought here.

131
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,277
Excuse me. I've been observing

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,989
what's been going on over here
and I have something to say.

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,639
Listen up here, Woody.

134
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,792
Do you realize
that in the course of the evening,

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,476
Diane has made 1 7 errors
in the areas of grammar...

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,308
...etiquette and statement of fact?

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,439
Frasier, your pedantry is insufferable.
And you suck eggs.

138
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,870
All right, Sam, I've thought about it,
and I've decided

139
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,237
- I definitely wanna make the bet.
- No, you don't. Think some more.

140
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,039
Well, I'm the one who's been
winning the pool.

141
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,553
And you know what I think?

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,073
You think I'm some dumb hick

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,435
who can't make it on his own
in the big city.

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,512
No, I don't. I just think it's a dumb bet.
Case closed, Woody.

145
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,069
But it's my money
and I'm willing to take the risk.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,669
Woody, I can dig up
a bookie somewhere.

147
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,355
- I'll make the bet for you.
- Woody, I'll make the bet for you.

148
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,636
Might as well keep it
in the family.

149
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,189
- Sam...
- No, no. You heard him.

150
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,113
It's his decision. It's his money.
He's a grown-up.

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,796
- Where's your money?
- Thanks, Sam.

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,274
Come on, man, don't tell me you keep
your money in your shoe.

153
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,675
Boy, you guys really do think
I just fell off the turnip truck.

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,677
This is where I keep the map of where
the money's buried in my backyard.

155
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,195
- Hey, is that him?
- Yeah, yeah, I think it is.

156
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,273
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,078
For he...

158
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,270
- Good to see you all too.
- Sorry, Sammy,

159
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,351
- we thought you were Woody.
- Can you believe it?

160
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,559
- The kid actually hit his parlay.
- I know. Boy, that's fantastic, isn't it?

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,517
- Yeah.
- So, what is this?

162
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,148
- What are you guys doing?
- We're planning a little celebration

163
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,153
- in honour of Woody's good fortune.
- A celebration, huh?

164
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,278
You mean like food, music, drink,
that kind of thing?

165
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,317
We're not providing any of that,
but we're hoping

166
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,835
Mr Moneybags will spring for that
when he gets here.

167
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,633
I don't think it's such a good idea
to make a big deal out of this.

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,268
You'd just be encouraging him
to gamble some more.

169
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,274
He won 10,000 bucks. What more
encouragement does he need?

170
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,829
- Oh, fine.
- Hey!

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,878
Thanks a lot, guys.
Hey, but guess what.

172
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,556
I've got some great news.
I won that parlay.

173
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,029
We know, Woody. Congratulations.

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,191
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers.

175
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,828
- So, Sam, did my money get here yet?
- No, not yet.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,798
They'll be bringing it pretty soon.
Matter of fact, I'll call right now.

177
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,157
Carla, why don't you start
that celebration here.

178
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,031
Hi, everybody.

179
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,313
Diane, listen.

180
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,836
I'm here to tell you that I've just spent
the most painful week of my entire life.

181
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,789
I was ice-fishing in subzero-degree
temperatures in Nova Scotia.

182
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,430
I don't think I could have stood it
for another minute, but it was worth it.

183
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,957
Because every iota of pettiness in me
was left back on that frozen tundra.

184
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,552
So I'm here just to ask you
to please forgive me.

185
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,750
- Apology accepted.
- lncomplete sentence.

186
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,317
Oh, my God.

187
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,789
I hope they're still biting.

188
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,231
What's this?

189
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,992
"Please"...

190
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,516
-...something.
- Please get in here!

191
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,712
Sam, is this an M or a double N?

192
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,515
Just forget about that and sit down,
will you. I'm in big, big trouble.

193
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,033
I did something that--
It felt so right when I did it,

194
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,079
but now it turns out to be all wrong.

195
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,392
What's her name,
and how many months?

196
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,110
I never placed Woody's bet.

197
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,630
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,790
Sam, for the first time in your life
you had the right intentions,

199
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,872
and it still blew up in your face.

200
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,189
It was such a stupid bet.

201
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,920
I was just trying to protect him.

202
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,913
What am I gonna do?
I mean, I don't have $10,000.

203
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,556
Oh, dear.

204
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,510
Well, we know that Woody
actually did pick the winning teams.

205
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,713
Yeah? So?

206
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,873
- So why don't you go to the bookie
- Bookie.

207
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,792
and tell him that you
honestly intended

208
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,349
to wager on the winning teams...

209
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
...and see if he won't
give you the money.

210
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,358
That's a good idea.

211
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,080
While I'm at it, why don't I just tell him
that I meant to bet on

212
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,676
- all the winning teams since 1975?
- Can you do that?

213
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,478
Please!

214
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,835
Well, Sam. Why don't I just
sound Woody out for you?

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,630
There's always the possibility
that the money isn't important to him.

216
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,553
Yeah. Maybe not.
Oh, that's a good idea.

217
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,994
Oh, thank you.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,673
Sam, by the way,

219
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,311
thank you for coming to me for advice.
I'm touched.

220
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,199
Well, if this works out, you will be.

221
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,592
Hey, Sam, that guy still didn't
show up with the money.

222
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,035
- He is gonna give it to me, isn't he?
- Of course he will.

223
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,069
No bookie would welsh on a bet.
He'd be the lowest spitwad on earth.

224
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,549
Actually, murderers are lower.

225
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,472
You know, back home we'd take
welshers, rub them with bacon fat

226
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,438
and throw them in the sty
with Romeo, the friendly hog.

227
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,030
- Well, gee whiz--
- Woody, why don't you and l

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,519
- have a chat.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,468
- Oh, sure, Miss Chambers.
- There's a table right over here.

230
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,233
Woody...

231
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,118
...I want to speak metaphysically.

232
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,673
And you need money for
the language lessons. No problem.

233
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,669
Let's start again.

234
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,512
What I'm talking about
is the meaning of money.

235
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,033
What is it worth?

236
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,556
It can't buy love, it can't buy friends,
it can't buy happiness.

237
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,029
Well, you're right, and I already have
all those things.

238
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,713
So, in fact, you have everything.

239
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,838
And it wouldn't matter if you
never got that money at all.

240
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,395
Oh, you're serious.

241
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,998
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Chambers.

242
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,318
You see, it's just that my family
never had a lot of money

243
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,870
and still my folks were always
making sacrifices for us kids,

244
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,156
especially my mom.

245
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,399
I remember something she
used to say to me, she'd say:

246
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,314
"Woody, hold on to your dream.

247
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,155
I lost mine, but I want yours
to come true."

248
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,593
It always made me sad to think of
what Mom gave up for us.

249
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,831
What was your mom's dream?

250
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,598
To be a drummer in a power trio.

251
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,955
Her big hero was Ginger Baker
in Cream.

252
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,874
Whenever we'd walk by
the music store in town,

253
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,749
she'd just stare and stare
at the Ludwigs in the window.

254
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,749
I knew even though she was
standing in front of Keller's Music,

255
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,876
that in her head she was up
on some stage

256
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,077
banging out the solo in "Toad."

257
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,428
It must have been tough to go back
to breading cutlets.

258
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,557
Now she's gonna get those drums.

259
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,838
And with heavy metal coming back,
who knows what might happen.

260
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,432
Bless you, Woody.

261
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,830
Bless you, Miss Chambers.

262
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,319
How'd it go?

263
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,596
Not well.

264
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,593
Sam, I feel utterly defeated.

265
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,992
Here you came to me
as a friend asking for my advice,

266
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,596
- and I let you down.
- I know.

267
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,793
Is there anything I can do
to help you in this time of crisis?

268
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,030
Not dressed.

269
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,798
What a shot!

270
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,758
Sam, maybe you ought to
call the bookie again.

271
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,876
Sit down for a minute here, will you.

272
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,311
Woody, you know that old
expression, "When you win a bet,

273
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,675
you never get paid for eight days"?

274
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,753
- No, but I like it.
- Well, it's an old lrish expression.

275
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,798
Which is probably why the bookie
hasn't shown up yet.

276
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,997
But you know what, it gives you
an opportunity

277
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,709
- to do some financial planning.
- Financial planning?

278
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,110
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
like spreading out the payments

279
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,953
over a period of time, just like they do
with the lottery winners.

280
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,588
- Lottery winners?
- Yeah, yeah. All right. Listen.

281
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,356
Here's my plan.
Now, I'll keep the $10,000 for you

282
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,876
and I'll give you, let's say,
$1 a week for 10,000 weeks.

283
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,558
Or, all right, maybe the deluxe plan.
Two bucks for 5000 weeks.

284
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,233
What do you say?

285
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,029
Well, it's a tough choice,
but I think out of those,

286
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,952
I'll stick to the whole thing at once.

287
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,439
- You're kidding me!
- No.

288
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,151
No, you're missing the obvious benefit
of spreading out the tax burden.

289
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,515
- Am I right, Norm?
- Oh, yeah. Great plan.

290
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,468
You'll be real happy you did it when
you reach the age of 412, I think.

291
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,110
Let's talk, Woody. Come on.

292
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,076
Sit down, Woody.

293
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,956
I've been trying to think of
an easy way of saying this,

294
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,394
but I don't think there is any.

295
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,476
I never placed your bet
with my bookie.

296
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,312
Here's your thousand dollars back.

297
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,272
You never placed the bet?

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,035
No, I was trying to take care of you

299
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,760
the way Coach used to
take care of me.

300
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,832
And it worked out about as well, too,
which scares the hell out of me.

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,991
Sam...

302
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,030
...I wanna thank you.

303
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,156
You're welcome.

304
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,314
Oh, wait a second here.
Why aren't you going crazy?

305
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,512
Because it's the nicest thing
that anyone ever did for me.

306
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,591
Are you kidding me?

307
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,433
I mean, not only did I not make
the bet, I lied about it.

308
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,955
Woody, you should be going crazy.

309
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,552
It was for my own good, Sam.

310
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,310
Come on, man, don't do this to me.

311
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,872
You're out $10,000 because of me.

312
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,271
You couldn't have known
how it was gonna turn out.

313
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,158
You thought I was gonna lose.

314
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,595
No, wait a second.
What difference does that make?

315
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,036
Come on! Man, I cheated you
out of $10,000.

316
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,794
I mean, who do I think I am?
You should wanna kill me, Woody.

317
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,235
It happened. I really don't see
the point in getting angry.

318
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,789
Now, you're not being honest.
Now, down deep, you're mad.

319
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,155
- You know you are.
- Maybe I am, just a little.

320
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,550
No, you mean, "Hell, yes, I am, Sam!"

321
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,039
Come on.

322
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,670
It was still the nicest thing
that anyone ever did for me.

323
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,990
You're a great man, Sam.

324
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,516
Oh, man, you're hopeless.

325
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,310
Go on, get out of here. At least
let me feel like a jerk in private.

326
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,997
Sure, Sam.

327
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,360
- Sorry.
- No, don't say--

328
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,512
- Sam?
- What?

329
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,192
I can't stand to see you like this.

330
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,352
Would it make you feel better
if I took the dollar a week?

331
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,392
Come on, man. A dollar a week
is meaningless.

332
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,114
How about a dollar a week
and a raise?

333
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,557
Nice gesture. Not good enough.

334
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,597
Okay.

335
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,911
How about a dollar a week, a raise...

336
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,191
...and your Corvette?

337
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,431
My car?

338
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,231
Not a chance.

339
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,554
- Why not?
- Don't be ridiculous. It's my car.

340
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,991
- But you owe me $10,000.
- I don't care. I mean, it's my car.

341
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,912
But you said you wanted
to make it up to me.

342
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,799
We're talking about my car, Woody.

343
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,030
I see.

344
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,792
You say you're sorry,

345
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,190
you say you care,
but when it comes down to it,

346
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,032
- it's just a lot of lip motion.
- No--

347
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,714
Well, I think that stinks!

348
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,632
- That's good.
- You're nothing but a selfish,

349
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,552
- lying creep!
- That's good. That's good.

350
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,233
- You're angry now.
- Oh, you bet I am!

351
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
- Now I'm gonna go pack my bags.
- Oh, no. Wait a second.

352
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,679
What are you doing?
What do you mean?

353
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,992
Oh, you're my boss and I yelled
at you, I can't stick around.

354
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,913
Woody, Woody, Woody.
That was just a little yelling.

355
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,878
- Now, that doesn't mean anything.
- Well, no, but I've never yelled

356
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,871
at anybody like that before in my life.

357
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,871
- We can't be friends anymore.
- Woody, come on.

358
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,191
Woody, friends yell
at each other. It's okay.

359
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,557
Coach and I used to fight all the time,
but we were good friends.

360
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,756
- Really?
- Yeah.

361
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,036
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
it made us closer sometimes.

362
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,509
- Oh, sure.
- No, I'm serious.

363
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,716
Come here. Come here. Listen.

364
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,235
Coach was a great peacemaker.
He had this little trick.

365
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,597
He'd... You know, after a big fight,
he'd make us

366
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,878
put our arms around each other
and sing "Home, Home on the Range."

367
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,189
- I know. It sounds pretty silly, huh?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,838
Well, do it for me anyway.
Come on, Woody.

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,118
Come on. Yeah, there you go.

370
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,556
Coach used to start me out
on the first few notes.

371
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,478
Oh, give me a home

372
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,552
Where the buffalo roam

373
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,032
And the deer and the antelope play

374
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,191
- How long we gotta sing this?
- Half an hour.

375
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,476
Coach said that if you could sing
"Home on the Range"

376
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,950
with a man for half an hour,
you couldn't possibly hold a grudge.

377
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,157
Where seldom is heard

378
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,278
A discouraging word

379
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,309
And the skies are not cloudy all day

380
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,789
- You feeling better?
- I still want your car.

381
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,589
Home, home on the range

382
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,469
Where the deer
and the antelope play

383
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,349
- Coach's old trick.
- Oh, good. Everything's okay.

384
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,511
A discouraging word

385
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,798
And the skies are not cloudy all day

386
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,919
Home, home on the range
