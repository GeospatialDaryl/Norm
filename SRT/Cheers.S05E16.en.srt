1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,088
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,556
Okay, guys, that's it.

3
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:08,558
Closing time.

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,060
Already?

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,461
It's hard to believe

6
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:15,065
17 hours could slip by that quickly.

7
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:16,566
Well, good night, Sammy.

8
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,069
Good night. Guys, don't
forget, tonight's the night

9
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:20,570
we go off daylight savings time.

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,073
Be sure to change your clocks.

11
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:25,075
Let's see now, it's 2:00
now, so which way does it go?

12
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:28,078
That's "spring forward,
fall back," Mr. Peterson.

13
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,081
All right, so it's, uh, 1:00.

14
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,582
1:00?

15
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:33,583
Set 'em up, Sammy.

16
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:39,089
I was this close to going home.

17
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,957
I love this universe.

18
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:46,763

Afternoon, Sam. Everyone.

34
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,836
Hey, Frasier.

35
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:00,837
What's wrong?

36
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,839
You look like you lost your best friend.

37
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,208
Well, in a manner of speaking, I have.

38
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,510
A colleague of sorts passed away today.

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,514
Someone who contributed volumes
to the world of psychology.

40
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,017
Well, I'm sorry. Is it anybody I know?

41
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:15,852
Bombo the chimpanzee.

42
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,604
Oh.

43
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,105
Don't you remember, Sam?

44
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,607
They shared an office.

45
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,112
See, Bombo was one of
Dr. Harry Harlow's apes.

46
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,982
Dr. Harlow was a behavioral theorist

47
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,483
who worked extensively with primates

48
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,902
studying human parenting
and child rearing.

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,872
Bombo was the last of the group.

50
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,373
And he was the baby.

51
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:38,374
I can still see him

52
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,879
clutching his little
cloth surrogate mother.

53
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,881
I don't think we'll
ever see his like again.

54
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,882
Can I get you anything?

55
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,885
Please. Something to take
my mind off my troubles.

56
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:51,387
How about a banana daiquiri?

57
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,508
Cute. Yeah.

58
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,347
Good afternoon, everyone.

59
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,148
Hello.

60
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,151
Oh, hello, my darling.

61
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,021
Oh, my, will you look at that ring.

62
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,740
My boyfriend gave it to me.

63
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,027
You'll have to pardon my giddiness.

64
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,529
I am in such a glorious mood today.

65
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,531
I don't think anything could spoil it.

66
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,033
Bombo is dead.

67
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
Nope. Not even that.

68
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
I have been selected to serve

69
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,543
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

70
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,929
on jury duty.

71
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,130
(groaning) I'm so sorry.

72
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,348
That's awful.

73
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,100
They tried to get me once,

74
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,102
but I got off 'cause
I got a good excuse.

75
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,104
I'm the sole support of six kids.

76
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,107
I suppose they felt that anyone

77
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:45,608
who hadn't mastered birth control

78
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,111
isn't smart enough for jury duty.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,783
You know, I tried to serve,
but they disqualified me. Yeah?

80
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,152
Yeah. I can't understand it,
'cause they went for my theory.

81
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,070
What theory's that?

82
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,322
The one about, uh, bringing
back the guillotine.

83
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,125
Gee, they, uh, turned you down, huh?

84
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,043
I guess the old inmates
are running the asylum, huh?

85
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,631
Well, I'm honored to have been chosen

86
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:12,001
to participate in our
system of jurisprudence.

87
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,388
I'll be proud to serve
on a jury of my peers.

88
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,889
Or so they'll think.

89
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,178
You know, other than voting,

90
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,598
I think jury duty is the
single greatest privilege

91
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,483
America bestows on her citizenry.

92
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,685
Couldn't get out of it, huh?

93
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,353
I tried everything.

94
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:37,243
Hey, you know who that is?

95
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,111
Yeah.

96
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,612
Oh, yeah, it's Eddie LeBec.

97
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,998
NORM: Eddie LeBec right here. All right.

98
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:42,915
Wow, Eddie LeBec.

99
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,201
Who is Eddie LeBec?

100
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,003
Well, if they're
excited about seeing him,

101
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,005
he's either a sports figure

102
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,007
or he holds the world's record

103
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:54,010
for stuffing beer nuts up his nose.

104
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,513
Uh-uh-uh, that is Jimmy
"The Snorkel" Stevens, Diane.

105
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,381
Yeah, he's a, uh,

106
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,799
new goalie for the Bruins.

107
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
Hey, that old guy is hardly new.

108
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,519
He's been around the league
for a while. Yeah, but since

109
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,355
the Bruins picked him up,
he's won five in a row.

110
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,856
FRASIER: Boy, the injustice of it.

111
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,142
A man rises to such popular acclaim

112
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,811
simply by stopping a
hockey puck with his face...

113
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
...while a courageous little chimp

114
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,200
who advanced man's scientific knowledge

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,069
dies almost anonymously.

116
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,955
You should have gotten the
monkey a pair of skates.

117
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,159
You know, I've always had this thing

118
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,660
for the goalies and catchers.

119
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,662
Guys who wear masks.

120
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,049
Some girls like the scorers,
you know, the glamour guys?

121
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:36,302
Me, I like the grunts who crouch down

122
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,805
and take everything
that's thrown at them--

123
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,673
scarred faces,

124
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,010
teeth missing, noses
mashed to a meaty pulp.

125
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,897
God, they're sexy.

126
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,816
He's looking pretty
thirsty over there, Carla.

127
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,818
Why don't you, uh...?
Ooh, let me at him.

128
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,191
Hi, there.

129
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,528
Uh, could I have a glass
of club soda, no ice,

130
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,415
two slices of lime and
a red straw, please?

131
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,341
Club soda, no ice, two slices of lime,

132
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,342
and a red straw, please.

133
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,846
Sam, a... club, club soda...

134
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,214
Yep, I heard, I heard, I heard.

135
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,599
Yeah, that was masterful, Carla.

136
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,601
Hey, you know what,

137
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,603
you know what line I
think really won his heart?

138
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:35,561
Wow, Eddie LeBec.

139
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,065
It sure is exciting seeing
a sports figure in real life.

140
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,571
What about, what about me, Woody?

141
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,073
Well, I can't speak for you, Sam.

142
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,075
I only know I'm excited.

143
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh, thank you.

144
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,087
Uh, Eddie, uh...

145
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,588
sorry I'm a little tongue-tied.

146
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,590
I... I guess it's because

147
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,592
I'm really a big fan of yours.

148
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,593
Oh, really? Yeah.

149
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,594
You know who I am?

150
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,596
Are you kidding?

151
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,599
Eddie LeBec, born Hull, Quebec.

152
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,102
Drafted out of the
juniors in the fifth round

153
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,603
to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

154
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,105
Played for a year with the Leafs,

155
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,107
then traded to the Winnipeg Jets,

156
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,109
then to Calgary, then to Boston. Wow.

157
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,361
Two game misconducts, 78 and 81.

158
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,197
Currently leads the
league in goals against.

159
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,699
Mm-hmm. Unmarried.

160
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
Favorite number
is 5-5-5-7-8-4-3.

161
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,704
What's that?

162
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,205
Where I can be reached at night.

163
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,707
Oh.

164
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,208
Well, heh,

165
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,460
it's really nice meeting you.

166
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,294
Carla. Oh.

167
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,795
Carla Tortelli. Hey.

168
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,796
Could I get you some pretzels?

169
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,798
Oh, no, I just drink, uh, one club soda,

170
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,799
no ice, two slices of lime

171
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,801
and a, and a red straw
before every game.

172
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,303
Oh, superstitious, huh?

173
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,304
Oh, uh, no.

174
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,806
Just things have been going
so well for me here in Boston,

175
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,308
I, uh, don't want to do anything

176
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,809
that might change that, you know?

177
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,060
Oh, right.

178
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,862
Well, uh, what other little rituals

179
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:00,863
do you have?

180
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,865
Oh, I don't know.

181
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:05,735
Uh, I brush my teeth every day.

182
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,652
(both chuckling)

183
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,154
No kidding. I, um...

184
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,155
I don't know.

185
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,158
I lace my left skate
first, then my right skate.

186
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,159
Left and right, yeah.

187
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,661
And, um, since my
winning streak started,

188
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,080
I, I wear my underwear inside out.

189
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,585
You are really a fascinating guy.

190
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,589
Oh, gosh, Carla, you
know, I, I got to go.

191
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,590
Uh... Yeah.

192
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,591
It was really nice meeting you.

193
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,093
Yeah, you, too. Yeah, thank you.

194
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,094
Say, Carla,

195
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,597
would you like my tickets
for tonight's game?

196
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,598
Whoa! Yeah, well,

197
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
you can just pick them up at Will Call.

198
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh, thanks!

199
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,103
It was really nice meeting you.

200
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,105
You too, Eddie. Okay.

201
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,106
Bye. Bye.

202
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,108
See you.

203
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,111
Guys! Guys, guys, get this!

204
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,114
I've got Eddie's tickets
to the Garden tonight!

205
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,616
NORM: No way!

206
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,500
Bruins and Canadiens.

207
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,253
Seats so choice you can smell the sweat.

208
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,121
CLIFF: Oh, yeah.

209
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,123
Anybody want the other ticket?

210
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,626
Oh, God, I'd love to go, but I can't.

211
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,627
I got to work.

212
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,629
Oh, too bad, Sam.

213
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,047
Wait a minute.

214
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,433
Don't you have to work, too?

215
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:14,220
You don't think you can
keep me here, do you?

216
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,225
Come on, what happened to "Sam,
could I please have the night off?"

217
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,728
Sam, may I please have the night off?

218
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,230
Yes.

219
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,234
See how easy it is if you just ask?

220
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,235
So, who's it going to be?

221
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,237
(Norm and Cliff clamoring)

222
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,238
Well, I only have one.

223
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,739
(frantic pleading continues)

224
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,241
Cliff, Cliff, wait a second now.

225
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,743
I mean, our friendship's
a little too important

226
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,246
to be ripped apart
by something as stupid

227
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
as a hockey ticket, all right?

228
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,749
Well, I guess you're right, Normie.

229
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,751
A sporting event's only for a few hours.

230
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,003
Friendship like ours

231
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,804
lasts forever. Right. There you go.

232
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:51,724
So, who's going to take
it? (both clamoring)

233
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,725
None of you, you, you.

234
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,726
Get out of here!

235
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,227
Isn't there anybody else?

236
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,512
What about Frasier?

237
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,981
Hey, Frasier, you look like
you could use a pick-me-up.

238
00:09:58,981 --> 00:09:59,849
A hockey game?

239
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,350
SAM: Yeah.

240
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,351
No, thank you.

241
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,353
I've been to the bullfights in Spain.

242
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,355
I've been to the altar with Diane.

243
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,608
I think that's enough
carnage for one life.

244
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,945
Oh, come on, Frasier, go.

245
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,948
Bombo would have wanted you to.

246
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,950
Perhaps you're right.

247
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,204
You know, I've always wondered
what makes the average person

248
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,206
turn into an animal at a sporting event.

249
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,708
Perhaps I could witness the phenomenon

250
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,209
and write a paper on it.

251
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,711
Put Dr. Frasier Crane back on the map.

252
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,713
Carla, thank you. I accept.

253
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,466
Well, at least I won't
be fondled all night.

254
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,271
Man, what a game!

255
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,273
Eddie stopped 40 shots!

256
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,274
NORM: Oh!

257
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,778
I mean, I haven't seen a
guy have a night like that

258
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,281
since Harmon Killebrew hit
those three moon-shot homers

259
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,783
off of you, Sam.

260
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,785
Yes, I was certainly lucky

261
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,787
to be there to see that, wasn't I?

262
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,789
Then at the end of the game

263
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,292
when the crowd was giving
Eddie his standing "O,"

264
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,795
he skated right past me and spit.

265
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,299
Well, you're very lucky, Carla.

266
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,802
Most men would have been embarrassed

267
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,805
to make such a show
of affection in public.

268
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,307
You know, I got to believe you're right.

269
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,309
Yeah, Carla, where's Frasier?

270
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,811
I don't know. The last I saw of him,

271
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,813
they were hauling him
off in a security van.

272
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,984
Well, just curious.

273
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,318
"Security van"?

274
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,820
What happened?

275
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,321
I don't know. I was watching the game.

276
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,823
I guess there was some kind of scuffle.

277
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,824
He got caught up in it.

278
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,192
(laughing)

279
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,162
Good Lord!

280
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,415
Oh, hey, Carla, look who came back, eh?

281
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:42,918
I'm sure he's not here just to see me.

282
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:43,919
Yeah?

283
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,920
Carla,

284
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,423
the man spit.

285
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,929
Hey, great game, Eddie.

286
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:54,930
(both laughing)

287
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,931
Thanks, Carla.

288
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,932
Want a beer? Yeah, sure.

289
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,435
Beer, Sam.

290
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,938
So, uh...

291
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,940
what're you doing back here?

292
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,941
Well, I'm kind of new in Boston.

293
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,309
I really don't know anybody.

294
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,730
That'll be all.

295
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
Well, how about the
other guys on the team?

296
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,119
I don't know.

297
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:19,121
Most of the other
guys are, I don't know,

298
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,623
married or they have girlfriends,

299
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,626
so I just thought I'd
come back and see...

300
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:25,127
you know, how you liked your seats.

301
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,629
Loved 'em!

302
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,632
I like your seat, too.

303
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,001
Carla, you coquette.

304
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,254
Say, uh, Carla,

305
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,806
you, can you come around and sit down

306
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,308
and, uh, maybe we can talk a little bit.

307
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,309
Sure!

308
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,314
Oh, thanks.

309
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,319
So, you're a hockey fan, eh?

310
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,321
Oh, yeah.

311
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,322
Well...

312
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,191
what else should I know about you?

313
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,993
Me? Well, uh,

314
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:01,947
I'm in my mid-20s,

315
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,950
never been married,

316
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,836
got no kids.

317
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:10,122
You're next in line to
the throne of England.

318
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,431
Dr. Frasier Crane,

319
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,934
noted psychiatrist,

320
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,436
winner of the Mildred Bergen Fellowship,

321
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,440
author of 27 published
articles, is out on bail.

322
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,946
Frasier, what happened?

323
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,447
Well, you know, I've
always prided myself

324
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,949
on being a man of control and maturity.

325
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,954
But suddenly I was swept up
into this crowd's excitement.

326
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,456
Well, damn me to a junior
college for saying it,

327
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,959
I was enjoying myself.

328
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,327
But I guess

329
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,796
the controlled mayhem of the situation

330
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,298
made me more assertive.

331
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,799
Also, there was this guy
sitting in front of me

332
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,301
who insisted on wearing his cowboy hat.

333
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:59,805
Well, I asked this huckleberry
several times to remove it,

334
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,307
and he refused,

335
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,809
and so then I just took it off
his head and handed it to him,

336
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,060
and he handed it back to
me with his fist in it.

337
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,263
(laughs)

338
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,647
Next thing I know,

339
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,150
I'm in a holding cell at
some North End station house

340
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,102
with the cast of The Road Warrior.

341
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,906
Did you get Mel Gibson's autograph?

342
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,412
So, uh, so you had a little fight.

343
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:24,413
You stood up for yourself.

344
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,665
Come on, look me in the
eye face-to-face here.

345
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,751
Didn't it feel great?

346
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,587
Well, I have to admit,

347
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,088
(chuckles)

348
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:34,089
There was a moment there

349
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,591
when I had a feeling of satisfaction

350
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,092
like never before in my life.

351
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:38,093
Sorry, Diane.

352
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,595
Oh...

353
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,966
So, Carla, I'd better
get back to my place.

354
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,967
I gotta look at some films.

355
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,970
I just, uh, I don't know,

356
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,974
I just wanted to stop in
and see, you know, just...

357
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,975
Hey, Eddie, you know,

358
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,977
I really should be honest with you.

359
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,479
I do have kids. Two.

360
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, I love kids.

361
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,482
Six.

362
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,453
I'd still like to see ya again, okay?

363
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:05,454
Oh, anytime.

364
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,456
Okay.

365
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,459
No, no, no, no.

366
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,962
If these guys, you know,
find out that you kissed me,

367
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,964
that's all I'd be hearing
about for the next month.

368
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,465
All right. Come on.

369
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,840
He kissed me!

370
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,383
Well, Sam, that was my lawyer.

371
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,884
He's managed to get the authorities

372
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,386
to drop all the charges.

373
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,387
All right. Okay.

374
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,389
Got off scot-free, huh?

375
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:41,390
Not exactly.

376
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,892
It seems I have to undergo seven hours

377
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,894
of psychological counseling.

378
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,399
Man, it is busy back there, Sam.

379
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,403
So, uh, Carla, you're seeing
old #33 again tonight, huh?

380
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:57,406
No, Cliff, Eddie's got a game tonight.

381
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:58,907
Yeah, after a couple of nights with you,

382
00:15:58,907 --> 00:15:59,908
he's looking for something

383
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,410
a little less strenuous to do, eh?

384
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:06,415
Listen, you couch potatoes,
don't get the wrong idea.

385
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,417
There's nothing serious between us.

386
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,418
We're just friends.

387
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:12,338
Well, you say that, Carla,
but why am I picking up

388
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,757
the subtle fragrance of la belle amour?

389
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,144
You know, I like Eddie well enough.

390
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,146
And... what can I say?

391
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,148
It's kind of a kick dating a star.

392
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,516
I mean,

393
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,402
I've never been out before with a guy

394
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,404
who has a driver come and pick him up

395
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,905
and take him anywhere he wants to go.

396
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,190
Ooh, he's got a limousine?

397
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,574
No, he has me.

398
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,078
But he pays for everything.

399
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,080
You know, movies, parking, refreshments.

400
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,583
Do you know how much a tub of
popcorn is going for these days?

401
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,085
It's, uh, $3.70 at the Alto.

402
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,090
Yeah, that Eddie takes
care of me real good.

403
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,592
But you're not falling for him, right?

404
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,595
Oh, look, who are we fooling here, Sam?

405
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,597
I mean, you know my luck with men.

406
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,599
You can't swing a dead cat

407
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,602
without hitting some bum
who once dumped on me.

408
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,056
And...

409
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,559
Eddie LeBec is a star.

410
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,561
You know, once he's been here a while,

411
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,564
he'll know a lot more people,
and it's "Bye-bye, Carla."

412
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,565
Hey. No way

413
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,534
some guy like that ends up with me.

414
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
Listen, will you stop
cutting yourself short?

415
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,038
You offer a lot of things to a guy.

416
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,041
Oh, yeah, sure. Six kids,

417
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
mortgage up to my ears, stack of bills,

418
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,046
dead-end job and fallen arches.

419
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,298
You know, if I weren't
already engaged...

420
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,634
Hi, Sam.

421
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,086
Hello.

422
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,087
Sorry I'm late.

423
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,090
The first day of the trial went
a little longer than I expected.

424
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,091
Oh, that's all right.

425
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,592
Just grab an apron.

426
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,095
We got the Bruins playing tonight.

427
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,097
And the Eddie LeBec Fan
Club is holding forth,

428
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,099
led by President Carla Tortelli.

429
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,101
Right. Luck of the draw.

430
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,102
I think I have gotten

431
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,605
the most challenging and
interesting case of the year.

432
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,607
Oh, that's great. Listen,
do me a favor, will ya?

433
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,609
Go upstairs and get
me some change, please?

434
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,610
Fine.

435
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,614
Of course, I can't discuss
the details of the trial,

436
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,616
but, oh, only if I could.

437
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,618
Quarters. Mostly quarters, yeah.

438
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,620
I can tell you that

439
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,123
I've been chosen foreman of the jury.

440
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,125
Well, that's great.

441
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,627
Yeah, listen, you do good
with this change thing,

442
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,629
and I'll make you captain of the bar.

443
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,633
Well...

444
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,136
just as well that I'm leaving.

445
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,140
I wouldn't want to slip and
divulge too much information.

446
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,642
Particularly in this case.

447
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,645
Attempted murder.

448
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,647
(chuckles)

449
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,151
This is the last place
I'd talk about it.

450
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,153
Once I let something out,

451
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,157
you'd all be prodding
me endlessly for details.

452
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,658
Sammy, is Diane coming in today?

453
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,160
(chuckling): Yeah.

454
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,663
Hey, folks.

455
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,549
Hey, Sam. Hey.

456
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,550
Hey, Carla. NORM: Eddie.

457
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,551
How you doing?

458
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,553
Woody, get that man a club soda,

459
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,054
no ice, two slices of lime,

460
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,055
and a red straw.

461
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,056
(chuckles)

462
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,559
Is that really what you want? Yes, sir.

463
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,427
How'd you know that, Sam?

464
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,397
He ordered it yesterday.

465
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,400
Oh, well, then I'd better hurry.

466
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,023
You know, I used to, uh...

467
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,525
I used to have this little ritual

468
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,026
when I was pitching for the Red Sox.

469
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,027
Mm-hmm.

470
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,529
Before every game,

471
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,032
I'd go out to our third base
coach, Ernie Pantusso, and...

472
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,035
he'd rub my tummy and I'd rub his head.

473
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,036
Next thing we knew,

474
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,038
the whole stadium was
looking at two grown men

475
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,041
standing in the middle of
the field rubbing each other.

476
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,545
After that we, we did
it in the locker room.

477
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,549
Pretty soon after that,
we just stopped altogether.

478
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,553
Anyway, all I know is that

479
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,555
I've never played better
than, than this in my life.

480
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,556
Yeah?

481
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,058
The puck's looking as big as a frisbee.

482
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,560
My reactions are quicker than ever.

483
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,562
I've never been happier.

484
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,564
I'm not gonna do anything
to break my routine.

485
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,066
(Sam laughs)

486
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,068
Except to add one thing.

487
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,077
Whoa.

488
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,080
I'm dedicating tonight's game to you.

489
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,083
SAM: Good night, Eddie.

490
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,084
Good night.

491
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,085
Hey, Eddie.

492
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,086
Your wallet fell out of your coat.

493
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,089
Oh.

494
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,091
(chuckles)

495
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,092
(laughs)

496
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,594
Stop kidding around.

497
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,096
Okay, I'll see ya.

498
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,348
He's always kidding around.

499
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:35,150
(Carla laughing)

500
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,072
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: ...is on the attack.

501
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,907
They bring it out on center
ice now on the red line.

502
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,408
The puck is tipped away, Flyers.

503
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,277
The Bruins get it back again, and...

504
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:52,284
Of course, I can't really
talk about the trial.

505
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,786
No, no, I had the vodka gimlet.

506
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,788
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

507
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:00,792
I could, I suppose, give
you a hypothetical case,

508
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,294
just to give you an idea.

509
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,298
Not that it would be
the same, but similar.

510
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,300
Now, we have a defendant

511
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,304
who's accused of attempted
murder of his wife.

512
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,306
We'll call him Scum.

513
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,808
And a wife.

514
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,810
Let's call her Victim.

515
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,815
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

516
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,817
It's just that I can't help it.

517
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,820
I'm compelled to share it with someone.

518
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,823
But no, no, I'm not
going to say another word.

519
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm going to zip my mouth. (chuckles)

520
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,794
Can I get you anything else?

521
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
No, zipping your mouth will be fine.

522
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
(yelling)

523
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,719
Hey, how much time we got left?

524
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,720
Minute and a half.

525
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,221
Oh, come on, Eddie. Come on. You got it.

526
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,222
He's got to be the greatest.

527
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,224
I mean, three periods and overtime,

528
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,726
and the Flyers have only
put one in against him.

529
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,727
Sure.

530
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,228
Man, can he ever hold them.

531
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,229
Oh, you think he can hold 'em?

532
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,731
I've had four beers this period alone.

533
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,733
I have not left this
barstool. All right?

534
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,235
(grumbling, laughing)

535
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,103
Give me an A.

536
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:02,020
A!

537
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,521
Give me a B!

538
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,438
B!

539
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:03,939
Give me a C!

540
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:04,906
C!

541
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,407
Give me a D!

542
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,358
D!

543
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,859
Wait, wait a minute,
Woody. What're you doing?

544
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,745
The alphabet. We're warming up here.

545
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,079
Give me a...

546
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:20,088
What exactly is the
definition of attempted murder?

547
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,591
Does... does the accused

548
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,093
actually have to go through
with the crime and fail?

549
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,596
Or is it our duty

550
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:32,434
to look into his craven heart
and determine his intent?

551
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,771
I mean, how often does
someone just happen

552
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,606
to lose control of a power saw?

553
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,442
(yelling)

554
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,811
CARLA: Come on, Eddie!
I'm here! I'm with you!

555
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,696
Uh, Carla, he picked a heck of
a game to dedicate to you, huh?

556
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
CARLA: You're telling me.

557
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,733
Sammy. Sam, would you look at me?

558
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,234
I'm on top of the world.

559
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,736
I'm Eddie LeBec's chick.

560
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,238
I mean, I am dating the
hottest goalie in the league,

561
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,740
and everybody knows me.

562
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,243
For once in my life, I
really feel like I'm somebody.

563
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,996
(yelling)

564
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,831
No, no, no, the Flyers stole it!

565
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,332
Now, don't worry, boys.

566
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:06,334
It's time for the old
Tortelli lucky charm.

567
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,588
Eddie, for you.

568
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,306
Battle for the puck along the boards.

569
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,175
Time running out. Doesn't look like

570
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,177
they'll get a shot off.
Five seconds, four seconds.

571
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,063
Brock plays it on the boards
and Fratti shoots. He scores!

572
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,481
The winning goal for Philadelphia!

573
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,732
The game is over on a shot

574
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,517
that LeBec should have
blocked in his sleep.

575
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,020
(TV shuts off)

576
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,521
(whistles) Great.

577
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:29,024
Eddie blew it.

578
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,493
Just my luck.

579
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,361
You know,

580
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:37,115
if it was me in that fairy
tale, and I kissed the frog,

581
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,118
he'd end up turning into a lizard.

582
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,621
One who couldn't go to his left.

583
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,622
Come on, come on, come on.

584
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,623
Lighten up on him.

585
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,124
He just had an off night, that's all.

586
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,626
I mean, that guy is gonna take us

587
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,010
all the way to the Stanley Cup.

588
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,462
(all murmuring agreement)

589
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,964
You're right. I mean,
what am I saying? Yeah.

590
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,467
He'll bounce back tomorrow.

591
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,853
You bet. He'll be fine.

592
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,221
Inside of a week,

593
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:03,225
that Muyaak will be ice
fishing in Nova Scotia.
