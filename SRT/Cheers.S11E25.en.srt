1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:04,018
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:07,021
FRASIER:
Good evening, gentlemen.

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,906
What mindless divertissement

4
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:11,459
occupies your waning
attention span tonight?

5
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:13,637
It's the, uh,
National Cable Ace Awards...

6
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:16,731
given for excellence in all
facets of cable programming.

7
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,032
I stand corrected.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,002
Are you watching
for any particular category?

9
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,554
Yes, the most impressive display

10
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,223
of female flesh in the, uh,
tight-fitting dress.

11
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,425
You're watching for cleavage.

12
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,110
Living for cleavage.

13
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,997
Stunning super model Kim Alexis

14
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,099
is listed as
a presenter. Yeah.

15
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,633
Yeah, Kim Alexis.

16
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,636
Boy, how often her lovely form
has graced the pages

17
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:40,939
of the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue, huh? Yeah.

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,676
And how often some youngster
slipped underneath the blankets

19
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,079
with a flashlight
and looked at the same issue

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,490
while their mother pounds
on the door and says,

21
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,316
"It's past your bedtime,
Clifford!"

22
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,918
(chuckles)

23
00:00:57,272 --> 00:01:00,341
Or whatever the lad's name
happens to be.

24
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,246

Hey, Dr. Crane, you know,
tomorrow's the big day

32
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:51,993
I'm getting sworn in
in Boston City Council.

33
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,663
Oh, yes, the beginning
of your political career.

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,833
It started out as a small joke
and turned into an enormous one.

35
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,819
Yeah, and listen,
I was wondering if

36
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,188
maybe you could help me out
with the speech I'm giving.

37
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,706
Well, of course I'll take
a look at it, Woody.

38
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,041
Where is it?

39
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,659
Well, I, you know,
I was wondering

40
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,350
if maybe you could
write it for me.

41
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:14,048
All right, I'll be your
speech writer, Woody.

42
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,250
What ideas would you
like to incorporate?

43
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:21,021
Okay. Looks like I'm gonna
need one more favour.

44
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,859
(chuckling)

45
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,093
Welcome to Cheers.

46
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,797
Can I take your
order, handsome?

47
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:31,232
Can I be your order, handsome?

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,867
Cutty Sark neat, please.

49
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,002
Okay. Would you
like that in a glass

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,740
or shall I pour it over myself
and let you lick it off?

51
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,743
Come on, Carla,
this happens to be my guy.

52
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,245
Yeah, well, I can fix
that in ten minutes.

53
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,897
Five- if I use jumper cables
and a wet towel.

54
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,468
Listen to me- "my guy."

55
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,805
That feels good
to say, "my guy."

56
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,172
Hi.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,658
(giggling)

58
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,393
Hi.

59
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,528
Oh, uh, Rebecca, listen.

60
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,530
There's something really
important I've been wanting

61
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,684
to ask you all night, but, uh,
I guess I'm just too nervous.

62
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:09,520
Uh, well, y-you know,
I'm a plumber

63
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,490
and I'm not very good
with words and, uh...

64
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:14,125
Oh, why don't we just forget it.

65
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,443
No!
No-no-no-no!

66
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,812
Wait, wh-why don't you just
sit here and relax

67
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,481
and, uh, you think about that
question you want to pop

68
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,617
and, uh, I-I'll get
us some champagne

69
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:25,119
so that we can celebrate
the answer.

70
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,875
TV ANNOUNCER:
And our next presenters are

71
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:32,861
Salman Rushdie and Dr. Ruth.
(applause)

72
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,880
(remote clicks)
Sleepy time down South, huh?

73
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,200
Hey, everybody.

74
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,702
REBECCA: Oh.
CLIFF: Hey, Sam.

75
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,704
Sam, come here, you're just
the guy I want to talk to.

76
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,072
Come here.
Where have you been?

77
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:48,743
Well, the sex compulsion
therapy group thing.

78
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah. We're all real
proud of you with that.

79
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:52,914
How's that thing going?

80
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,816
Uh, slow but painful.

81
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:58,419
This week I'm not gonna
think about sex at all

82
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:02,891
or even hear about or talk
about anything remotely sexual.

83
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,942
Sam, it's about my love life.

84
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,661
Yeah, that should be safe.

85
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,998
Listen, I think

86
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,500
the most important thing in
my life is about to happen.

87
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,902
Don is gonna propose to me.

88
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,469
Oh!
No, shh...!

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,722
REBECCA: But he's having a
little bit of a hard time...

90
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,640
he's sort of shy and he
can't really spit it out,

91
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:22,610
so I'm gonna coax him along by
giving him a little champagne.

92
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:24,446
Do you think
that's a good idea?

93
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,563
Oh, that's the best idea
I've ever heard.

94
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,900
Listen, uh, let me buy
the champagne...

95
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,917
the best stuff I've got.

96
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,051
Best stuff.

97
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,337
Wh-Wh-Which
is the best stuff?

98
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,173
Uh, it's the bottle with
the Flintstones on it.

99
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:39,910
Wh-What you watchin' there,
guys?

100
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:41,479
The Cable Ace Awards, Sammy.

101
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,147
Yeah. We're
breathlessly awaiting

102
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:45,798
the appearance of stunning
super model, Kim Alexis.

103
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,568
She the one with the great...

104
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:48,636
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:49,904
See you.

106
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,107
Aw, poor Sammy.

107
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:54,575
NORM:
Breaks my heart.

108
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,095
First the man has to give up
drinking and now women.

109
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,929
Yeah. Boy...

110
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,048
there's no way in
hell Clifford C. Clavin

111
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,233
could ever give up babes.

112
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:05,169
(chuckles) I'd explode.

113
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,722
I know where you're
coming from.

114
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,292
You've got to understand, Don.

115
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,661
I've always been
at a disadvantage.

116
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,263
(sighs)

117
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:19,867
See, I was born with only
one erogenous zone, and...

118
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:24,705
unfortunately, it
covers my entire body.

119
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,074
That's why I've had
to work extra hard

120
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:29,510
to get to where I am today.

121
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,213
Frankly, Carla, uh,

122
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:34,315
I don't think
I could satisfy you.

123
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:38,819
I'm not sure the men of Desert
Storm could satisfy you.

124
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,238
Carla, will you excuse us?

125
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,306
Don and I are in the middle of
a very important conversation.

126
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,357
So are we.

127
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,176
Carla, shoo!

128
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,579
Okay, I'll leave
you alone with your handsome plumber.

129
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,300
Don...
Mm.

130
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:56,471
You, uh, you said
that you had something

131
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:59,607
that you wanted to ask me?

132
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,227
Well...

133
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:07,865
Rebecca, we've only known each
other a very short time, and...

134
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,768
but in that time, I've come
to care for you very deeply.

135
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,887
And...

136
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,755
I've been happier with you
than anyone else

137
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,591
and I... I don't want
that happiness to ever end.

138
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,927
Rebecca,

139
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:23,364
will you m-m-m-marry me?

140
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,833
(gasping):
Oh, Don!

141
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:27,702
Of course I won't!

142
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:28,836
Huh?

143
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:29,954
What?

144
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:33,541
That was, that was a mistake.

145
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,608
Ask me again.

146
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,443
Will you marry me?

147
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,695
No!

148
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,447
Oh!

149
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,949
What the hell is happening?!

150
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,351
Rebecca, are you okay?
Yeah.

151
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,620
D-D-Don, hold it.
Just sit there one second.

152
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,856
(sotto voce):
"Rebecca will you marry me?"

153
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,558
Oh, I love you so much, Don.

154
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,892
Of course I'll marry you.

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,894
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

156
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,647
Okay, Don, ask me quick.

157
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,134
Rebecca, will you marry me?

158
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,302
Never!

159
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,503
Oh!

160
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,538
I don't know what's happening!

161
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:05,990
Oh, well, I do!

162
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:08,947
You obviously don't feel about
me the way I feel about you.

163
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:11,629
See you around, Rebecca.

164
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,631
Nice knowing you.

165
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:19,269
(sobbing)

166
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,627
Rebecca...

167
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,629
Rebecca, are you all right?

168
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,631
Yes, thank you!

169
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,767
Oh, God!

170
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:36,938
Oh, I just let the man that I
love walk right out of my life.

171
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:40,174
Oh, please, Frasier,
go get him.

172
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,576
Oh, okay, of course.

173
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,644
Wait!

174
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,944
Wait a minute.

175
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:46,197
Maybe I said no because
deep down inside,

176
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,666
I know that we haven't known
each other long enough.

177
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,452
(sighs)
Yet if he walks out now,

178
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,571
I may never see him
for the rest of my life.

179
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,973
Oh, come on, girl.

180
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,841
Take a chance.

181
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,659
All right.
Go, go, go, go!

182
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,628
No! Hold it!

183
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,096
No, I mean, maybe, maybe I know

184
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:04,815
that this just isn't the right
thing to do, deep down inside.

185
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,034
Wait a minute,
I've got it. I've got it.

186
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:08,569
I-I'm just gonna do nothing.

187
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,337
Absolutely nothing.

188
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,006
I'm just gonna sit down here

189
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,442
and pretend like the whole thing
was a dream.

190
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,229
(shouting):
Run, Don! Run!

191
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:20,898
Run like the wind!

192
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,043
Norm, hey, Norm, new category.

193
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,259
This may be the end of
our long, dark night.

194
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,061
TV ANNOUNCER:
And now to present the award

195
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,364
for best writing in a movie
or miniseries,

196
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,199
here are super model, Kim Alexis

197
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:42,370
and Hall of Fame player
and coach, Mike Ditka.

198
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:46,573
(hooting) (barking) (barking)

199
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:47,875
Thank you.

200
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,210
Thank you.

201
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,612
You know, Coach,
I was wondering,

202
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,016
which one of us has had the most
coverage in Sports Illustrated?

203
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,685
No contest, Kim.

204
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,187
That would be me.

205
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,522
Oh, you mean because you've
had so many great years

206
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:04,124
on the gridiron as being both
a player and a coach, right?

207
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,835
No, I mean because when I've
seen you in the magazine,

208
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,696
you've had very little
coverage at all.

209
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:10,030
Oh, you.

210
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:12,900
(hooting) (hooting) (laughing)

211
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,652
You know, I think it's unfair.

212
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,054
I think that they should do

213
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,089
an issue featuring
swimsuits for men.

214
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,424
Great idea.

215
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:23,561
The only thing is, the ladies
have to model the suits.

216
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:26,214
(howling) (hooting)

217
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,748
Coach, you're incorrigible.

218
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:30,017
I don't write it,
I just say it.

219
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,786
Shall we present the nominees

220
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:35,156
for best writing of
a movie or miniseries?

221
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,490
Why not?
Okay.

222
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,892
The nominees are:

223
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,162
Jerry Burger, Tulsa Farewell.

224
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:44,998
(applause)

225
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,935
Diane Chambers,
The Heart Held Hostage.

226
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:50,804
(applause on TV)

227
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:55,742
Rhonda Kizowski,
A Dream of Gladiolas.

228
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,860
Wait.

229
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:58,011
Did you hear that?

230
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,346
Did my ears deceive me?

231
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:00,815
What's the matter, Dr. Crane?

232
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,599
Well, I thought
I heard Diane Chambers' name

233
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,001
in that list of nominees.

234
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,136
Robert Vanderveer
and Kenneth Montoya

235
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:11,308
for Tris... Tristan and Isolde
Get a Place in Jersey.

236
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,977
And the winner is...

237
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:17,381
(drum roll)

238
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,618
Diane Chambers,
The Heart Held Hostage.

239
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,336
(applause on TV)

240
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,639
(dramatic music playing)

241
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:27,074
Can it be?

242
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,609
Is it really her?

243
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,127
Thank you all.

244
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,865
And thank you, cable television,
for allowing those of us...

245
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:39,170
who eschew the pap and pablum
of commercial television...

246
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:41,872
to sing, to dance, to write

247
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,409
and to listen
to the whispers of our muses.

248
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,712
Although sometimes the voices of

249
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,282
Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe,

250
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:58,456
Melpomene, Polyhymia,
Terpsichore, Thalia and Urania

251
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:01,058
are too soft to be heard.

252
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,161
Forgive me, gals,
if I forgot someone.

253
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,580
God, is it her.

254
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:09,800
Thanks to my parents for

255
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,052
conceiving and bearing me.

256
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,588
Although both wanted a boy...

257
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:19,860
locked as were so many of their
generation in masculine primacy.

258
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,430
Anyhow, where to begin?

259
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:27,201
Guess we, better go tell Sammy
the romance of his life

260
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:28,669
is on national TV.

261
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,105
Yeah, well, she was once the
romance of my life, too, Norm,

262
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,156
or are you forgetting?

263
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:35,025
She dropped you
like a bad habit.

264
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,526
Sorry I didn't bring that up.

265
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:42,600
Thanks to the Amazon Rain Forest

266
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,603
for providing me and you,
ladies and gentlemen,

267
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,406
with 40% of our oxygen.

268
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,408
The devastation must end!

269
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,811
Woody, I want you to look
at the television

270
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,246
and tell me what you see.

271
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:01,218
Uh, the television
isn't even on.

272
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,970
(sighs)

273
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:07,007
(chuckling): I just must be
having one of my little spells.

274
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,159
Thanks to you, Sylvia Plath...

275
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:12,379
Whoa! This is a doozy!

276
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,750
Let me say this,

277
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:20,620
your tragic story will be
my next project.

278
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,423
Hey Woody, lock up for me,
will you?

279
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:24,124
I'm gonna take off.

280
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:29,230
Oh, Lord, I tell you,
that Kim Alexis is hot.

281
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:33,567
Look to her right.

282
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:36,454
Thank you, Dr. Wendell Brandt...

283
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,223
Oh, my God.

284
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,809
For believing in and inspiring a gangly...
(orchestra playing)

285
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:45,412
college freshman
in creative writing.

286
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,932
It was Dr. Wendell Burgoyne

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,668
who was my creative
writing teacher...

288
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,970
(orchestra plays
dramatic passage)

289
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,573
My entire script was
written on recycled paper.

290
00:12:56,641 --> 00:13:00,144
You have to be taught to hate.

291
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,765
So, local girl makes good. Hmm.

292
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:09,103
Ah, well, here's to Diane
and her success.

293
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,788
Well, I'm gonna do
you one better there.

294
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,258
I think I'm gonna send her a
telegram of congratulations.

295
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,960
You know, it's kind of
the classy thing to do.

296
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,663
H-H-Hold it.
Wait a minute.

297
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,033
Why would you be sending a
telegram to my hallucination?

298
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,303
Unless, it's not
a hallucination.

299
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,037
What-what-what are
you talking about? The...

300
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,706
Oh, yeah.

301
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,726
Oh, yes. Yes, it is.

302
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:35,730
As a matter of fact, this, this
whole thing is part of the hallucination.

303
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:37,297
(all agreeing)

304
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:41,335
Wow. I must have been
in a car accident. Mmm.

305
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,936
I'm probably in a hospital

306
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:46,423
right now, hooked up to a bunch
of machines,

307
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,125
barely clinging to life.

308
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,077
Yes. That's... that's
probably true.

309
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:51,712
Phew. What a relief.

310
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:02,740
(phone ringing)

311
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,478
Cheers.

312
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,263
Hello, Sam.

313
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, hello there.

314
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,202
Thanks for the lovely telegram.

315
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,171
How did you find me?

316
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:20,524
Uh, Frasier, uh, you know,

317
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:25,296
has a colleague who's kind of
a shrink to the stars in L.A.

318
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:30,016
Oh, well, I'd hardly call
myself a star.

319
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,269
Well, I didn't say you were.

320
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:35,923
Well, I didn't say you did.

321
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,675
Yeah, anyway, you know, he knew
somebody who knew somebody

322
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:42,112
who knew somebody
who'd kind of heard of you.

323
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,132
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch.

324
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,335
I've been terribly busy.

325
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:51,222
Well, there's
no need to apologize.

326
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,823
Uh, life's been great for you.

327
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,211
It's been great for me, too.

328
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,243
Oh really, Sam?

329
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,978
Is life okay for you?

330
00:14:58,045 --> 00:14:59,846
Okay? You kidding me?

331
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:01,782
Ah, it couldn't be
better, you know.

332
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,050
Business is great,
family's great.

333
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,952
Hair is thicker than ever.

334
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,458
Family?

335
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:12,959
You're married?

336
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:16,463
Well, you didn't think I was
gonna... wait around for you

337
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:18,231
for the rest of
my life, did you?

338
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,100
I didn't say that.

339
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,735
I didn't say you did.

340
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,037
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Great gal.

341
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:25,539
Yeah, great kids, too.

342
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:28,409
You know, they sure
grow up fast, don't they?

343
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:32,513
What about you, Diane,
you, you got children?

344
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,748
I have three.

345
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,667
Well, we have four.

346
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:43,791
That's, uh, that's-that's
one more than you, I guess.

347
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,827
Yes.

348
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:48,295
Well, anyway, he's
a wonderful man.

349
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:50,063
You'd like Reed.

350
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,799
Well, if you're ever in Boston,

351
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:54,601
make sure you, uh, you
bring him over to the bar.

352
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:58,939
Well, you know, actually,
I have been meaning to come back to Boston.

353
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:02,943
I've been invited to speak at
almost all my alma maters.

354
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:09,450
I was afraid of running
into... problems.

355
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:13,787
But maybe we will come back
now that we've been invited.

356
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,622
I'll have to check
Reed's schedule.

357
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,458
Yes. You do that.

358
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:20,678
Yes, uh, sure hope
you can make it.

359
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:23,597
Thank you.
I hope so, too.

360
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:28,235
Well, bye, Diane.

361
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,503
Bye.

362
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,126
Sammy...

363
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,545
Why did you invite her here

364
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,346
when you're lying
about being married?

365
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:41,782
You kidding me?
She'll never show up here.

366
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,680
Besides, she's the one who's
lying about being married.

367
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:46,270
How do you know?

368
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,554
Because I know the woman.

369
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:48,722
I know she's lying.

370
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,224
Fortunately, I also
know that she knows

371
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,591
that I know she's lying,

372
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,394
which is why she'll never dare
show her face in Boston.

373
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,015
She's coming.

374
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,473
How's it going, Cliffie?

375
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,175
Aw, I'm in no mood to talk.

376
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,212
(cheering)

377
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,349
Aw, guys, thanks for cheering
me up with your humour.

378
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,434
Okay, I'll tell you
what's bothering me.

379
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,702
Oh, please, dear God,

380
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,504
Let this be a story
about the post office.

381
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:25,191
There's this, uh, there's this
guy down at work, Marty Furman.

382
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,028
Don't you people know
from sarcasm?

383
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,864
There's a supervisor's position
going on in my department

384
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:32,299
and Marty's the guy who, uh,

385
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,176
is in charge
of deciding who gets it.

386
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,403
And wouldn't you know it,
every flunky and his cousin

387
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,438
is kissing up to him like
there's no tomorrow.

388
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,475
Why does this bother
you so much, Cliff?

389
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,193
Oh, because I rightfully
deserve that job,

390
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,244
but I'm not going to
stoop to their level.

391
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,747
No siree, Bob.

392
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:49,249
Everything I've gotten in my
life I've gotten on merit.

393
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,852
That explains
your meteoric rise.

394
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,823
"I believe I was elected
to the city council

395
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,725
"as an agent of change.

396
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:02,196
"And I fully intend to
live up to that pledge.

397
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,598
I will make change."

398
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,837
No, change "change"
to "a change."

399
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,422
What?

400
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:14,291
No, see in here,
you make change.

401
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,793
There, you make a change.

402
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,528
So just make the change.

403
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,230
Change, "make change"
to "make a change."

404
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,132
Oh, just change it!

405
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:30,907
Well, I think I see why
Dr. Crane never cures anybody.

406
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,476
You know, I couldn't help

407
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,144
but overhear your little
speech there, Wood.

408
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,480
It was very interesting what
you said about cronyism.

409
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,232
You're gonna have
to be strong, though.

410
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,168
A lot of people are gonna put
a lot of pressure on you.

411
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,403
Imagine an old pal
who's been out of work,

412
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:47,141
a real good friend who
hasn't worked in years.

413
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,643
The guy could be
fully trained as...

414
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,679
I don't know...

415
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:56,150
let's say, an accountant.

416
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,368
But now?

417
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:02,223
He spends all his
time in a bar...

418
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,426
running up a tab that he'll
never be able to pay off.

419
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:09,196
You could probably help
that poor soul, Woody.

420
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,282
Pull a few strings
down at City Hall, get the guy a job.

421
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,237
(sobbing):
But you... you wouldn't do that, would you?

422
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:21,508
Because you're a man of honour
and principle and integrity.

423
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,660
I'll see what I can
do, Mr. Peterson.

424
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:28,314
I'll need $500
a week and a car.

425
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,653
Did Don call?

426
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,822
No. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

427
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,310
What a loser I am.

428
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:42,379
I'm so bad I should
form a club of losers.

429
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,114
You know, that's something
I could win...

430
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,016
president of the losers club.

431
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,836
Sweetheart, you-you look
like you slept in that dress.

432
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,105
I did.

433
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:53,274
And I may wear it for
the rest of my life.

434
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,375
Who would care?

435
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,643
In a couple of days,
we all will.

436
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,117
This is the dress
that I lost my guy in.

437
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:08,855
If you hear a scream
and a thud...

438
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:10,857
just keep drinking.

439
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,663
I don't think I'm getting
any work out of her today.

440
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:18,999
She doesn't do
anything, anyway.

441
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,969
And she doesn't start
that until noon.

442
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,892
Hello, everyone.

443
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,879
(screaming)

444
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,402
Nice to see you, too, Carla.

445
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,639
Diane...

446
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,074
What are you doing here?

447
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:45,742
(screaming)

448
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:50,497
You invited me, remember?

449
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:51,615
(screaming)

450
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,536
Carla, relax.

451
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:59,272
We're just here for a visit.

452
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,058
We?

453
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,943
Yes, I'm with my husband, Reed.

454
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,778
He's parking the car.

455
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:07,413
I wanted to bring the children
but they're in school.

456
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:09,866
Oh, great.

457
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,602
How-how great that is.

458
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,321
Sam, Reed and I would love
to take you to lunch.

459
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:17,057
Is your wife about?

460
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,359
Yes. Yes, she's about.

461
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:25,732
Um, I'll just, uh,
get my wife, Rebecca.

462
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,402
Yes, uh, my wife Rebecca.

463
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:29,770
Excuse me, a second.

464
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:31,271
Woody...

465
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,274
One, two...

466
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,115
Oh.

467
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:44,985
Rebecca, sweetheart,
you have to be my wife.

468
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,254
Okay.

469
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:53,359
Oh, now sure, I can
say "yes" to you,

470
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:57,197
because you mean about as much
to me as a rat's patootie.

471
00:21:57,198 --> 00:22:01,068
Listen, honey, I, I want
you to understand,

472
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,736
see, I lied to Diane.

473
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,734
You remember Diane?
Well, she's back.

474
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:06,406
Anyway, I-I-I told her
that I was married

475
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:07,808
because I knew she'd
never show up.

476
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,209
But she's here with her husband.

477
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,511
So, please, you got to be
my wife, just for lunch.

478
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,180
No. I don't know, Sam.

479
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,815
Look, please, please,
I'll owe you a big one. Please.

480
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,784
All right.

481
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:20,804
After losing the only
man I ever loved,

482
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,439
lunch should hit the spot.

483
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,379
Thank you.

484
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,381
Thank you, sweetheart.

485
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,715
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

486
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:33,150
You're such a friend.

487
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:34,785
And you're such a mess.

488
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:38,589
Uh, tell you what, why
don't we fix you up a little

489
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:42,325
then... ooh, then
we'll fix you up a lot.

490
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,035
I'm sorry, Diane.

491
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,604
I got a little carried
away when I first saw you.

492
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,672
I'm all right now.

493
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:56,723
Hmm.

494
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,443
Lovely to see you.

495
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:02,112
Thank you.

496
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:03,980
When will you be leaving?

497
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:11,755
Hello, Woody.

498
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:13,389
Well, hi, Miss Chambers.

499
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:15,492
What's new in your life?

500
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,595
Oh, well, you know,
I, uh, got married,

501
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,497
and I'm gonna have a kid.

502
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,732
Wonderful!

503
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,501
Yeah. Oh, also I
just got elected

504
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,503
to the Boston City Council.

505
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,575
How nice.

506
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:35,712
And I'm next in line
for the throne of England.

507
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,693
Really? Well, you know, maybe
we'll work together someday.

508
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,589
You know, hammer out
a treaty or something.

509
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,068
Hello, Diane.

510
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,172
Hello, Frasier.

511
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,330
You're looking well.

512
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:04,741
I'm feeling well.

513
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,676
I'm happily married
with a bright young son

514
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:07,777
and a successful practice.

515
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:09,329
But, you know,
what's most important...

516
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,930
and I just realized it
this moment...

517
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:13,049
is I'm over you.

518
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:15,669
I'm glad.

519
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,303
There's absolutely
nothing here anymore.

520
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:18,505
I'm over you.

521
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:21,407
You could be a-a total stranger
for all I'm feeling.

522
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:25,245
You could be ugly and gnarled
and toothless without that

523
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:28,481
shining hair,
those dancing eyes,

524
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,034
these graceful, supple limbs.

525
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,069
Thank God I'm free.

526
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,772
Frasier, you're hurting me.

527
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,108
Well, you never hurt me,
did you?!

528
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:44,330
Anyway, good to see you.

529
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:49,536
DIANE:
Norman, Clifford.

530
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:52,355
You're exactly the way
I remember you.

531
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:58,011
Well, uh, looks can be
deceiving there, Diane.

532
00:24:58,012 --> 00:24:59,646
I mean, our-our lives
have changed

533
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:02,549
in innumerable ways.

534
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:04,551
How so?

535
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,509
Well, uh, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

536
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,600
Uh, Diane.

537
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:22,302
Come on, come on, come on.

538
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:25,472
Uh, Diane, I'd like you to, uh,

539
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,476
I'd like you to meet
my wife, Rebecca.

540
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:30,910
Hello, Rebecca.

541
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:32,746
Hello.

542
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:37,584
So...

543
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:40,370
you're Mrs. Sam Malone.

544
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,188
Uh-huh.

545
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,058
Pretty nice, huh?

546
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,386
And she's a real pig today

547
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:49,929
compared to what she
usually looks like.

548
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:52,632
Hi, honey.

549
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,469
Hi.

550
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:58,771
So, Sam, Rebecca,
this is my Reed.

551
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,307
Reed Manchester.
Hi.

552
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:01,475
Hi, Sam.

553
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:02,592
How you doing?

554
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,245
Nice to meet you.

555
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,650
Well, awkward silences
always make me hungry.

556
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:11,701
(laughs)

557
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,723
Yeah, me, too.

558
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,421
Why don't we, uh,
why don't we go

559
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:19,993
up to Melville's for lunch?

560
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,095
Oh, Melville's, of course.

561
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,997
That's perfect.

562
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,532
So, uh, Sam, Diane tells me

563
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,835
you used to be a relief pitcher
for the Sox.

564
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:30,003
Yes, that's right.

565
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:32,138
So, uh, what was
your best pitch? My best pitch.

566
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,975
Uh, gee, that'd be, uh,
"Say baby, what's your sign?"

567
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,108
(chuckles)

568
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:42,916
That, uh, Miss Chambers' husband
seemed like a nice guy.

569
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:44,918
She'll make him pay for it.

570
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,659
If she's left him
a shred of manhood,

571
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,792
it's only because she's
waiting for the right moment

572
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:55,128
to-to flick it
away like the last

573
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,731
shrivelled pea on her plate.

574
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,402
Thank God I'm over her.

575
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:03,837
Hit me, Woody!

576
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,306
Four fingers of the
meanest swill you got!

577
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:14,647
And all my life, I've wanted
to be a documentary film maker.

578
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:16,649
That certainly is interesting.

579
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,320
So, Rebecca, tell us
about yourself.

580
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:24,156
Sam never mentioned
what you do.

581
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:25,925
He didn't?

582
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:28,961
Well, it never came up.

583
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:30,763
Well, uh...
(clears throat)

584
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:34,401
I am a... corporate
attorney...

585
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:39,923
with the firm Emerson...

586
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,458
Lake and Palmer.

587
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:46,712
That sounds familiar.

588
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:48,231
Yeah, they're a
pretty famous group.

589
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:49,399
Listen, um...

590
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:53,853
And what I specialize
in there is, uh,

591
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,556
is product liability cases.

592
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,091
That was good.

593
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,426
I mean, is good.

594
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:02,495
Because, uh,
it's a good job she has.

595
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:03,696
Oh, yeah.

596
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,815
And you still find time

597
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,984
to raise four small children?

598
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:11,487
Oh, they're not so small.

599
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:14,691
Uh, Sam Junior is, uh, five.

600
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,794
And, um, then Darby's four.

601
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,379
And, uh, Newton's three.

602
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,749
And then, uh,

603
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:26,019
little two-year-old
Chelsea, she's one.

604
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:33,426
Well, here's to
marriage and children

605
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,695
and the dawn of
a great new friendship.

606
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:36,829
Aw.

607
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:37,998
(sobs loudly)

608
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,000
(sobbing):
Don!

609
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:45,571
Why did you have
to mention Don?

610
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:46,756
(sobbing)

611
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,942
She-she's, uh,
she's very sentimental.

612
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,611
You see, we, uh,
we-we met at dawn,

613
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:54,346
and it's her, uh,
favourite time of day.

614
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:56,316
Come on, sweetheart.

615
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,484
Sit up there
and dry those tears of joy.

616
00:28:58,552 --> 00:28:59,652
(sobbing)

617
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:03,990
Rebecca.

618
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:05,458
I got to talk to you.

619
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:06,726
I've been up

620
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,094
all night thinking about this,

621
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,096
and I'm miserable without you.

622
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:11,530
You got to marry me!

623
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,400
You got to marry me,

624
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:16,870
and this time I won't
take no for an answer.

625
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:17,987
I love you.

626
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:19,055
Hi, Sam.

627
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:20,924
How you doing?

628
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,928
Huh?

629
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,095
I will marry you!

630
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:27,296
(laughing)

631
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:28,982
(Rebecca shrieks)

632
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:32,102
I said yes!
I did it!

633
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,238
Oh, Don, thank God
you came back for me!

634
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,806
(moaning)

635
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,359
Oh, Sam,
you don't mind, do you?

636
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,165
No.

637
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,088
Oh, uh, uh,
have a good day, Sam.

638
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:53,322
SAM:
You, too.

639
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,995
She's interesting.

640
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,119
All right, all right,
I admit it.

641
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,453
I'm not married; I lied.

642
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:09,722
I don't know why I did it;
It was a stupid thing.

643
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:11,841
Well, Sam, you'll find
someone eventually.

644
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,042
SAM:
No, don't do that.

645
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,040
Don't-don't-don't feel
sorry for me.

646
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,396
I hate that worse than anything.

647
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,447
REED:
Listen, Sam,

648
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:20,216
Diane told me
about your past together.

649
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,320
Maybe this...
public humiliation

650
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,854
is the clean break you needed.

651
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:28,074
Maybe now you can get on
with your life.

652
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:31,877
Aw, you see why I love him?

653
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:34,314
Okay, you want to tell me

654
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,182
just what the hell
this is all about?

655
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,802
Who are you?

656
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,805
He's, uh, he's a friend.

657
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:44,307
Oh, now I'm a friend.

658
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:45,909
Gee, I'm honoured.

659
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,177
Tell me, friend,

660
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,012
why did you leave our
place in Malibu yesterday

661
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,579
without so much as a
word of explanation?

662
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,282
You made me track you
down across country

663
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,749
just like some
sort of a gumshoe.

664
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,952
After seven years together,
I think I deserve better.

665
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,442
Is he the reason
you left me, Reed?!

666
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:05,611
(chuckling):
God, no!

667
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,429
Look, I-I'm just,

668
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:10,166
I'm just doing
a favour for Diane.

669
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,268
Okay, you're very good
at explaining things.

670
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:13,469
Only this time,

671
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,004
you're not quite
good enough. Well, wait!

672
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:17,640
Please, Kevin wait!

673
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:18,741
I was...

674
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:20,743
I-I'm sorry, Diane.

675
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,912
Muffin, come back!

676
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,011
So then what happened?

677
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,764
So the next thing we know,
Diane turns up here

678
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:44,767
with her husband
and asks to meet Sam's wife.

679
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,336
Holy moly.
CLIFF: Yeah, yeah.

680
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,371
Then Sam goes back there
and grabs our fair Rebecca,

681
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,106
introduces her
as Mrs. Malone,

682
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,675
then they toddle on up there
to, uh, Melville's for lunch.

683
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:53,993
Man, oh, man, oh, man.

684
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,495
Which ought to be
very interesting

685
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,129
because Rebecca's been
a total gibbering idiot

686
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,460
ever since Don dumped her.

687
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:01,434
Damn it all.

688
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,703
Everything neat happens

689
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:05,354
when I'm not here!

690
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:08,958
I always miss everything!

691
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,126
Yeah.

692
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,861
Oh, Don!

693
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,963
You put me down,
you big crazy thing!

694
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:15,699
You're gonna throw out
your big muscular back!

695
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,134
Oh, I'm never letting
you go again, Rebecca.

696
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,252
Oh, Woody,

697
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:22,171
Rebecca will be gone
the rest of the evening,

698
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:25,008
and I hope you can do
without her because I can't.

699
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,576
We're going out to make love
in the, uh, swan boats

700
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,012
in the public gardens.

701
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,881
Couldn't you just eat us alive?

702
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,885
REED:
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin!

703
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:38,154
I was pretending to
be Diane's husband

704
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,552
to fool her old boyfriend.

705
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:41,757
She's helping me write a
Tales From the Crypt!

706
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,026
It's that simple!

707
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,794
Very imaginative story.

708
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,963
Reed, I put up
with your astronaut,

709
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,331
your anchorman
and your all-pro quarterback!

710
00:32:49,332 --> 00:32:50,833
But this is it.
I'm leaving.

711
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:54,554
Please! You can just give me
one last chance!

712
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:03,897
I missed something, didn't I?

713
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,753
We're pathetic.

714
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:13,823
How so?

715
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:18,761
Sam, you just spent
the afternoon pretending

716
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:22,232
to be married to a woman
who's the emotional equivalent

717
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:26,536
of Mr. Toad's
Wild Ride...

718
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:29,472
and who's desperately in love
with another man.

719
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,142
Yeah, well at least
I didn't fly across the country

720
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,610
to make an ass out of myself.

721
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:40,350
Why bother when you do it
so brilliantly right here?

722
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,452
The only reason why I went
through all of this

723
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,621
is so you wouldn't get
the wrong idea.

724
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,340
And what idea was that?

725
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:48,975
That my life was empty.

726
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:52,578
That without you I'm lost and
alone with nothing to live for.

727
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:54,513
I mean, that's why you came
here, right,

728
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:55,748
to see something like that?

729
00:33:55,749 --> 00:34:00,002
I came back on a quest
for the truth.

730
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,121
Ah. And you just
brought along

731
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:04,524
your one-man Warren
Commission there, huh?

732
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,327
You want the truth?

733
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:10,325
You know, I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

734
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,733
My, my life is so full
it's, it's unbelievable.

735
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,484
Well, tell me about it.

736
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:16,602
Oh, no, no, no, no.

737
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,770
I'm sorry, sister.

738
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:19,538
You don't walk out of here
for six years

739
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:22,075
and then waltz back in and
expect to hear my story.

740
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:24,376
You know, I don't,
I don't tell about

741
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:27,997
my very rich and-and full life
with just anybody, you know?

742
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:31,301
That's exactly as I feared.

743
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,969
You're angry at me
for leaving you.

744
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,171
I don't have time
to be angry, honey.

745
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,440
I... too much to do.

746
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:40,743
When I went away
to finish my novel,

747
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:43,712
I promised to come back
to you in six months.

748
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,348
And I meant to.

749
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:50,219
But... well...

750
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:51,787
once the book was finished,

751
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,957
the publishers didn't want it.

752
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:57,093
I never figured out
why exactly.

753
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,912
But then my agent

754
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,799
suggested that I trim
a couple of thousand pages...

755
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,922
and make it a screenplay.

756
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,475
Could we hurry
this along, please?

757
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,777
You know, my, my
schedule's a real bear.

758
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,651
I didn't want to come back
until I was successful, Sam.

759
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:28,374
But six months became a year...

760
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:32,078
and by then I'd waited too long.

761
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,569
Oh, what are we doing?

762
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:44,173
This is for the best.

763
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,710
I mean, y-you and I
just don't work together.

764
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:52,014
Yeah, we had great
sex, you know?

765
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:54,383
A couple times there, we had

766
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,320
to perform CPR on each other.

767
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,197
But, uh, you know,
other than that,

768
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,725
we're a total mismatch.

769
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,961
I think we proved that
again today, don't you?

770
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:11,668
I guess we did.

771
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:17,506
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't have a full life.

772
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:23,195
I have my career,
some associates,

773
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:29,234
no family, a few friends,

774
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:30,970
and of course my muse.

775
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,975
Even Reed is just
my dog groomer.

776
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,598
Sometimes I feel
a little lonely,

777
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:45,201
but that's the life
I chose for myself.

778
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:51,674
So...

779
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,175
good-bye, Sam.

780
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,510
Yeah.

781
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,381
Oh, this is silly.

782
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,419
Bye.

783
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:08,424
Oh, wait-wait-wait,
hold on a second. Listen.

784
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:10,409
Before you run out of here,

785
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:13,012
can you do me one
little favour, please?

786
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,632
This isn't what you used
to mean by favour, is it?

787
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:17,833
Come here. Come on.
Sit down.

788
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,368
Please.

789
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:23,122
You know, it's just
that they, uh, they have

790
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:24,390
this great dessert here,

791
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:28,961
but you have
to order it for two.

792
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:31,163
What kind of dessert is it?

793
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:35,701
Well, they start
with ice cream.

794
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,070
I love ice cream.

795
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:40,356
Oh, no, but this is
the best ice cream.

796
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:44,226
It's sweet, rich, creamy.

797
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,181
What do they do to it?

798
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:53,936
Cover it with lots and lots of
thick raspberry sauce all over.

799
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:57,390
All over?

800
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,808
They can't stop themselves.

801
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:04,613
Sounds so sinful.

802
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,283
There's more.

803
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,986
More?
What more could they do?

804
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:14,307
Well, they heat up
the raspberry sauce.

805
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:18,110
How hot do they get it?

806
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:21,196
How hot would you like it?

807
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:22,898
Can I interest
you folks in dessert?

808
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:24,066
Just the check, please.

809
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,801
Quickly.

810
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,542
Ladies and gentlemen,

811
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:35,712
our new City Councilman,
Woody Boyd.

812
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:37,930
(whistles)

813
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:40,816
Thank you.

814
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:42,985
You know, I want you all
to know that

815
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:44,742
at City Hall I may be
councilman,

816
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,906
but around here
I'm just your old pal,

817
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:49,642
the Honourable Mr. Boyd.

818
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,744
(laughing):
That's very funny, Woody.

819
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:53,412
Of course, we all know
you're joking.

820
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:54,614
But the truth be told,

821
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:56,115
you know we all see you

822
00:38:56,183 --> 00:38:58,083
in a, well,
a different light now.

823
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,585
You've taken on
a certain dignity

824
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,053
and weight with this office,

825
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:02,838
and you will be
treated accordingly.

826
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,473
Well, thank you, Dr. Crane.
Hey!

827
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,876
Lonesome Cowpie,
I'm dry over here!

828
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,544
Right away, sir.

829
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:12,764
Well, Kelly, you
must be very proud of your husband.

830
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:15,367
Oh, yes, I certainly am,
Dr. Crane. Yes.

831
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:17,703
You know, the city of Boston
has lots of problems.

832
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:18,704
Oh.

833
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,239
I can't imagine
what they might be,

834
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,175
but I know Woody is the man
to solve them.

835
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,629
I hope you're right.

836
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,515
After all, we have
to make the town a safe place

837
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,218
for little Woody Jr.
To be driven through

838
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,620
on his way to private school.

839
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:39,559
An inspiring thought.

840
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,226
Yes, sir, I will.

841
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:42,804
I-I'll see you
in the morning.

842
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:44,530
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.

843
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:48,384
Well, everybody,
congratulate me.

844
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,887
I am now employed by
the City of Boston.

845
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:52,588
ALL:
Hey!

846
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,790
And I have this man
to thank for it.

847
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,759
Oh, hey, no problem,
Mr. Peterson.

848
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,095
I know you're gonna work
very hard.

849
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,362
Yeah, of course, Wood.

850
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,831
Hey, this kind of makes you
my boss, huh?

851
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:04,133
Oh, yeah, in a way,

852
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,568
but you know, deep down
and above all,

853
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:08,905
and through everything else,
we're friends.

854
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,106
Oh, of course.

855
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,607
No man ever had a better one.

856
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,875
I feel the same way.

857
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,011
Pals.
Compadres.

858
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:16,245
I may be late tomorrow.

859
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,431
I wouldn't recommend it,
Peterson.

860
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,254
Hey, everybody, guess what.

861
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,424
We got married!

862
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,775
ALL:
Hey!

863
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:36,248
We just ran off
to the Justice of the Peace

864
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,550
before we could change
our minds.

865
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,852
We're a little bit crazy,
aren't we?

866
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,488
She's a whole lot crazy,
and I'm not at all.

867
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:45,690
That averages out
to just a little.

868
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:48,027
Well done, Don!

869
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,895
You, you grabbed yourself
a real, a really,

870
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:52,464
a totally... Well,
you got Rebecca!

871
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:56,218
Say, Don, here, have a seat.

872
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:57,753
Let me get you a drink, huh?

873
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:58,988
Thanks, Doc.

874
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,489
Oh, sweetheart, I'll just
be over here.

875
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,524
Okay, hubby.

876
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,326
Don't you stop loving me!

877
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:09,348
(sobbing):
I married a plumber!

878
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,575
Oh, God!

879
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,611
I'm the wife of a plumber!

880
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,615
We're gonna have a whole bunch
of little plumbers.

881
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:30,586
And the horrible part of it is
that he's too good for me.

882
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:34,022
Gee, Miss Howe,

883
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,058
I mean, Mrs. Sandtry,
I, uh...

884
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,161
And my name's
Mrs. Sandtry!

885
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:46,519
Well, I think Don's gonna make
a great husband.

886
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:50,889
Well, of course, he is, Woody.

887
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:53,859
I just have a little case
of the wedding day jitters.

888
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:57,763
And I know I love Don
with all my heart.

889
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:01,099
And until he finds out
how screwed up I am and he dumps me,

890
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,536
we are gonna have the most
wonderful marriage.

891
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:08,758
Hear-hear, huh?

892
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:11,443
Say good-bye
to the old Cliff Clavin.

893
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:12,844
ALL:
Good-bye!

894
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,381
Say hello
to the new Cliff Clavin,

895
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:21,553
the new assistant supervisor
of sub-district A, grid L.

896
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,672
ALL:
Good-bye!

897
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,325
This, I'm here for.

898
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:36,535
Well, Cliffie, I guess
buying all those gifts

899
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,837
really paid off, huh?

900
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,239
Yeah, yeah, Norm.
You know, I was forced into it.

901
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,050
I mean, everybody else
was doing it.

902
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:43,509
But there's no shame
in kissing up

903
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,477
as long as it's
a honest display of affection

904
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:47,613
for those in authority.

905
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:50,082
You know, I guess the box
of steaks and a ham radio

906
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,152
is really a small price
to pay for this kind of advancement.

907
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,954
Yeah, well, I had to
up the ante a bit.

908
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:59,058
Yeah, I'm, uh, putting
on a family room on his house.

909
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:04,296
But I can hold my head up high.

910
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:06,932
You see, he's got
to furnish it himself.

911
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,736
Yeah, you see, once
that pool table is delivered, I'm out.

912
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:13,905
Hey, wait a minute,
where's Sammy?

913
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:16,275
Hey, Woody, was he
at the swearing in?

914
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:17,459
I didn't see him.

915
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:20,412
Oh, no!

916
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,782
Has anyone seen Sam since
yesterday

917
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:27,803
when he was upstairs
with Miss Robin Deadbreast?

918
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:32,524
Oh, no! Man, I slipped up!

919
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:35,227
I let down my guard!

920
00:43:35,228 --> 00:43:37,062
Anything that happens now
is my fault.

921
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:38,297
What was I thinking?!

922
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:40,432
Well, Carla,
for God's sakes, relax!

923
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:42,567
I mean, just look around you.

924
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:44,870
Woody's got a new position.
Norm's got a job.

925
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:46,271
Cliff's got a promotion.

926
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,774
Rebecca's got a husband!

927
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:51,492
I mean, this is the best day
in the history of Cheers!

928
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:52,978
Nothing could go wrong today.

929
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:54,780
Hey, everybody.

930
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,468
Diane and I are together again.

931
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:03,456
Did you hear what I said?

932
00:44:03,523 --> 00:44:05,524
I said, we're a,
we're a couple.

933
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:08,661
As a matter of fact we're,
uh, we're getting married.

934
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:17,719
Congratulations.

935
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,264
Fellas, I just said
we're getting married.

936
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:32,767
I think a little reaction's
in order, don't you think?

937
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,302
I knew it.

938
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,238
I knew it the minute-
the second...

939
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:38,607
I laid eyes on her,
all those years ago,

940
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,842
that it was the worst
moment of my life.

941
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,579
I knew that she was gonna ruin
everything someday!

942
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:46,214
This is it.

943
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:48,984
Hey, Carla, don't you think
it's time to give that up?

944
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:50,419
Never.

945
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,053
Carla...

946
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,523
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but maybe you should hear it.

947
00:44:55,591 --> 00:45:01,563
The screenplay for which I was
so extravagantly honoured

948
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:04,199
was based on your life.

949
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,971
You were my inspiration.

950
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,206
Really?

951
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:11,973
Yes.

952
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,979
It's the story of a resilient,
hard working mother,

953
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,148
bucking all odds
to raise her six children.

954
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,751
Six?

955
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,218
I got eight.

956
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:27,455
Good God!
You breed like a fly!

957
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:31,793
Well, uh, this movie-
people liked it?

958
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,863
They loved it, Carla.

959
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,066
People were inspired by
the plight of my heroine.

960
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,367
Yeah?

961
00:45:38,434 --> 00:45:39,768
Well, what happens to me?

962
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:42,371
I mean, you know,
to her, in the end.

963
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,507
Well... out of the despair
and frustration

964
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:47,142
of her unmanageable life,

965
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,511
she goes berserk...

966
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,714
and...

967
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,082
takes out a few people
with an Uzi.

968
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,287
That cost me
the Humanitas Award.

969
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,056
Diane...

970
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:04,627
you know, I've said a lot of
horrible and hateful things

971
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:06,394
to you over the years...

972
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:10,465
Well, if I said
something nice now,

973
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:13,134
would you get all yucky?

974
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,171
You have my word I won't.

975
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,576
Well... Diane, I...

976
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:23,896
Nah.

977
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,050
Life's too short.

978
00:46:31,254 --> 00:46:33,122
FRASIER:
So, Sam, uh,

979
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,957
you and Diane
are back together,

980
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:38,126
just like that, after
six years of separation.

981
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:45,668
Six years of growing and
evolving and self-discovery,

982
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:47,365
deciding what we want from life

983
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:49,071
and realizing that
we don't have it.

984
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,372
SAM:
Yeah, besides, uh,

985
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:51,940
last night, we both discovered

986
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:55,844
we still like...
the same desserts.

987
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:58,980
Yeah, anyway, what the hell,
you know?

988
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:00,849
I've always wanted
to live in California.

989
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,885
(murmurs of surprise and shock)

990
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:05,153
You leaving us, Sam?

991
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,588
Well, yeah, Woody.

992
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:08,490
Yeah, I am.
You know?

993
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:10,859
It's time for me
to move on, you know?

994
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:14,295
Face new challenges and-and
Diane said she'd get me a job

995
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:16,765
at the juice bar
in her health club.

996
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:20,702
FRASIER: Well, I had no idea
you had such exciting prospects.

997
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:22,093
By all means go for it, Sam!

998
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,572
Here's kiwi in your eye!

999
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,645
NORM:
Sammy... California?!

1000
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:32,882
Riots, smog, earthquakes?

1001
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:34,149
Don't make me laugh, now.

1002
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,884
There's no earthquakes
in California.

1003
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,020
There aren't?
No, there's never been any!

1004
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,522
See, what they tell us are
earthquakes are actually

1005
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:43,113
sonic booms caused by
a project that's been funded

1006
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,793
by the U.S. government.

1007
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:49,230
You see, what they're doing is
they're creating a huge cavity...

1008
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,767
a tunnel, if you will- right
to the centre of the Earth,

1009
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,535
where they're gonna
build a giant computer

1010
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,204
to control
the planet's rotation.

1011
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,677
Can I... can I be the only one
that's heard of this?

1012
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:09,418
You know, Cliff, electro-shock
therapy only sounds scary.

1013
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:12,376
Let me bring in
a colour brochure.

1014
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:14,823
It features Babar.

1015
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,025
Uh, can I get one?

1016
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,229
I'll bring in a boxful!

1017
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:24,632
Can we just get back
on the subject here?

1018
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,803
Sam is leaving us, okay?

1019
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,639
WOODY: So, uh, Sam, what are you
gonna do about the bar?

1020
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,174
Well, I thought I'd let Rebecca
run it for a while,

1021
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,012
then, afterwards, I'll sell
what's left for kindling.

1022
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:38,280
SAM:
Aw, come on, you guys!

1023
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,931
Lighten up, man.
That's a joke.

1024
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,534
FRASIER:
Sam, can I ask you a question?

1025
00:48:42,602 --> 00:48:46,588
And I mean this as a caring,
supportive friend.

1026
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:49,291
Have you lost your
freaking mind?!

1027
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,243
What are you talking about?

1028
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:53,612
The two of you had a
relationship whose best moments

1029
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:55,748
were full of anguish
and self-loathing.

1030
00:48:55,815 --> 00:48:57,933
After ten hours
with this woman,

1031
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,752
you want to give up
your life, your livelihood,

1032
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:02,087
and move with her
to California?!

1033
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:05,207
Hey, you want to get
off my case, fellas?

1034
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:07,309
You know,
I think you're turning on me

1035
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,644
'cause I just want to get
my life going here.

1036
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:12,080
I mean, look at me:
What've I got?

1037
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:15,884
No family, no future,
nothing to look forward to.

1038
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,686
CARLA:
Sammy...

1039
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,287
I can't believe
this is happening.

1040
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,089
Yeah, I can't either, Carla.

1041
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,792
Yeah, after all the
cheer leading I've done for you guys,

1042
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:26,361
even when I knew you
were making mistakes.

1043
00:49:26,362 --> 00:49:28,130
Oh, so you want us
to return the favour?

1044
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,082
Yes, yes, I do...

1045
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:31,950
And I'm not making a mistake.

1046
00:49:32,017 --> 00:49:33,285
NORM:
Sammy...

1047
00:49:33,352 --> 00:49:35,520
what's gonna happen to us?

1048
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:42,628
Come on, you guys.

1049
00:49:42,695 --> 00:49:44,062
I mean, all you fellas do

1050
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:46,698
is just sit there
and watch the world go by.

1051
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:48,800
You don't need me for that.

1052
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,069
I want to get off the bench,
you know?

1053
00:49:51,137 --> 00:49:53,605
I want to get in the game.

1054
00:49:53,673 --> 00:49:56,808
So, you just gonna desert us?

1055
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:59,578
You gonna just walk out,
like a traitor?

1056
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:01,913
A traitor?

1057
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:03,314
I need more than this!

1058
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:05,984
You know, you should
need more than this!

1059
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:07,686
I am not your mother!

1060
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,388
This is not your home!

1061
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,460
This is ridiculous.

1062
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,629
Come on, let's just
get out of here, you know?

1063
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,997
We got a plane to catch.

1064
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:21,166
Thank you very much for
all your best wishes, fellas,

1065
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:23,652
and for making it clear
that I'm doing the right thing.

1066
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,320
Come on, sweetheart.

1067
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:29,107
I'm sorry, everyone.

1068
00:50:31,444 --> 00:50:34,346
This is the best for Sam,
believe me.

1069
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:40,168
(door shuts)

1070
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:43,572
I gave that man the
best years of my life.

1071
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,662
CLIFF:
Yeah...

1072
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,298
We'll get along without him.

1073
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,002
Sure...

1074
00:50:57,069 --> 00:50:59,104
life goes on.

1075
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:07,746
Oh, Sam, you're not
still thinking about

1076
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:09,982
what those people said
at the bar, are you?

1077
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,751
No, don't be silly.
Furthest thing from my mind.

1078
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,920
It does bug you,
though, doesn't it?

1079
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:17,238
The way they thought we didn't
know what we were doing?

1080
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,274
I mean, we know, right?

1081
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,909
Damn right we know!

1082
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,543
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
Evening, folks.

1083
00:51:22,544 --> 00:51:23,928
This is Captain McGovern.

1084
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:25,764
I'm gonna ask
the flight attendants

1085
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:28,367
to prepare for departure now,
if they would, please.

1086
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:30,602
And as soon as
we get clearance from the tower,

1087
00:51:30,603 --> 00:51:32,070
we'll be taking off.

1088
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:33,672
Oh, Sam...

1089
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:37,342
In a moment,
we'll be off. Mm.

1090
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,644
Isn't this the perfect
beginning for our lives together?

1091
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:41,679
Taking flight.

1092
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,783
Speeding down the
runway side by side,

1093
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,385
until we lift from the ground,

1094
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:51,723
leaving far beneath us
the tedium of ordinary life,

1095
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:55,427
to soar into the bright,
unlimited future.

1096
00:51:55,494 --> 00:51:59,897
You ever hear
of the Mile-High Club?

1097
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:05,136
Oh, Sam, naughty-naughty.

1098
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:07,339
They give you
bonus points for it.

1099
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:11,076
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
Folks, this is your captain again.

1100
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:12,711
Sorry,
but we're gonna be delayed

1101
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,746
here on the tarmac for a bit.

1102
00:52:14,747 --> 00:52:17,649
We're having a minor problem
with our electrical system,

1103
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,485
and we'll need some time
to check it out.

1104
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:24,306
By the way, Sam, you might want
to take advantage of this delay

1105
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:27,309
to reconsider
what you're doing.

1106
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:31,813
Are you really in love
with this woman

1107
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:34,449
or are you trying to love her
because you're afraid

1108
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:35,850
of ending up alone?

1109
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,652
Think about it.

1110
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:46,878
Did you just hear that?

1111
00:52:46,945 --> 00:52:48,880
What?

1112
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:51,215
What the captain said to me.

1113
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:53,351
To you?!

1114
00:52:53,419 --> 00:52:56,954
He said they were
having trouble with the electrical system.

1115
00:52:57,022 --> 00:52:59,552
Why do you think he was
talking to you personally?

1116
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:03,561
Oh, boy.

1117
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:05,447
Oh, Sam.

1118
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:08,884
Aw, this is going
to be so great.

1119
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,085
Mm.

1120
00:53:10,152 --> 00:53:12,320
You're going to
love Los Angeles.

1121
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:17,960
I won't pretend it's a
modern-day Athens but...

1122
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:20,879
at least you'll
feel free there,

1123
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,482
feel free to explore
your own...

1124
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:26,284
ATTENDANT (over P.A.): Ladies and
gentlemen, this is your flight attendant.

1125
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:27,986
On behalf of your flight crew,

1126
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:30,522
I'd like to apologize
for this delay.

1127
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,390
We'll be coming
around the cabin

1128
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,694
to make sure you have
everything you need.

1129
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:37,195
And, for God's sake, Diane,

1130
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:39,230
you're a bright, alluring woman

1131
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:42,366
with a great deal
to offer mankind.

1132
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:44,669
Will this man
stimulate your gift

1133
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:47,172
or be an anchor, pulling you

1134
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:49,674
to the bottom of the sea
of mediocrity?

1135
00:53:55,414 --> 00:53:57,699
A fair question.

1136
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,418
I'm sorry- what is?

1137
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:03,487
Uh, nothing.

1138
00:54:03,555 --> 00:54:06,290
These seats are a little
tight, aren't they?

1139
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:08,193
Yeah... yeah.

1140
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,461
Well, you know,
it's been a long time

1141
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:12,097
since I've flown first class.

1142
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:14,966
I guess I remember it
being more comfortable.

1143
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:18,469
Yeah, so do I.

1144
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:22,306
I guess I remember life
being more comfortable.

1145
00:54:24,777 --> 00:54:26,995
(jet engines revving)

1146
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:28,997
Ah...

1147
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:30,766
We should've flown
another airline, you know.

1148
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,100
(clears throat)

1149
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,503
Well, it's too late for that.

1150
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,938
It doesn't make any sense
to rethink a decision

1151
00:54:36,939 --> 00:54:38,089
that's already made.

1152
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,641
Yeah, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

1153
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:40,942
A commitment is a commitment.

1154
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:43,745
We wouldn't want to change
things if we could.

1155
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,947
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
I'm sorry folks, but I'm afraid

1156
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:47,749
we're gonna be returning
to the terminal.

1157
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,451
We'll have you disembark

1158
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,053
and arrange for you
to take an alternate flight.

1159
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,356
Maybe we're being
a little overcautious,

1160
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,191
but we don't want
to make a mistake

1161
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:57,948
about something this important.

1162
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,361
Sorry.

1163
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,041
Hey...

1164
00:55:15,377 --> 00:55:16,778
You know...

1165
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,780
Yes.

1166
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:24,052
I think we both know.

1167
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:34,612
Good night, ladies.
Thanks again.

1168
00:55:37,116 --> 00:55:39,167
Do you believe those three?

1169
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,436
In here every night
trying to trap guys.

1170
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,171
Yeah, yeah... yeah, you'd
never see any wife of mine

1171
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,107
showing her face in some bar.

1172
00:55:46,108 --> 00:55:47,141
Yeah.

1173
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:48,952
She'd make more money
in a sideshow.

1174
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,583
Sam!

1175
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:56,968
What are you doing here?

1176
00:55:57,036 --> 00:55:59,120
Well, we changed our minds.

1177
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:00,922
I'm not going to L.A.

1178
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:02,723
Well, where is Diane?

1179
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:05,226
Probably over Kansas by now.

1180
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:07,729
The important thing is
we came to our senses.

1181
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,064
I knew you would, Sam.

1182
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,131
Yeah.

1183
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:11,566
Yeah, what do you
got there, Sam?

1184
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,434
Something I've been holding onto
for a while, Woody.

1185
00:56:13,435 --> 00:56:16,237
Uh, I thought maybe it was time
to open it up.

1186
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:22,343
Oh, my!
A box of fine Cuban cigars.

1187
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:24,028
CLIFF:
Uh, Sammy...

1188
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:26,380
I assume you realize that those
are illegal in this country.

1189
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:28,316
Shut up, Cliff.

1190
00:56:28,383 --> 00:56:30,251
Aye, aye.

1191
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,789
You know, I was hoping you
guys would, uh, join me

1192
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,105
in a smoke session tonight.

1193
00:56:34,106 --> 00:56:36,274
You know, kind of a
welcome home party.

1194
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:38,142
Cliffie, what do you say, man?

1195
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,761
Buddy, I'd love to stay,
but geez, it's getting late.

1196
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:41,929
I better beg off.

1197
00:56:41,997 --> 00:56:44,315
Oh, all right.

1198
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:46,567
How 'bout you, Norm?

1199
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:49,487
Can't, Sammy-
I came to the conclusion

1200
00:56:49,488 --> 00:56:51,405
I've wasted too
much time in this bar,

1201
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:53,407
like a couple of decades.

1202
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,443
Gonna go home to Vera.

1203
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:56,811
SAM:
Vera?

1204
00:56:56,879 --> 00:56:58,346
My wife.

1205
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,248
Maybe you remember her?

1206
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,216
That is her name, isn't it?

1207
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:04,653
See ya.

1208
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,755
Well, Carla,
what do you say, huh?

1209
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:09,290
Nah.
My shift's over.

1210
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:11,493
I've got to get home
to the kids.

1211
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,961
Appreciate the thought.
Maybe another time.

1212
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,031
Doc, help me out here, man.

1213
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:19,333
You want a fine cigar?

1214
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:20,735
Huh?
I'd love to, Sam,

1215
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:22,403
but Lilith just called

1216
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,474
and she wants me
to bring home Chinese tonight.

1217
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:27,442
I...

1218
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,210
I hope she meant the food.

1219
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:35,717
She's been really weird lately
and... you know.

1220
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,418
W-Woody, wait a minute, man.
What about you?

1221
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:39,754
Aw... can't Sam.
I gotta leave right away.

1222
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:40,822
Why?

1223
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:41,990
Carla's my ride.

1224
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,241
Well, I'll give you a lift.

1225
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:44,542
What-What's going on here?

1226
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:45,709
Why's everyone leaving?

1227
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:46,911
Come on, Sam.

1228
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:48,913
It's not like this is our home.

1229
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,325
Hmm.

1230
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:05,296
Oh, man.

1231
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:10,134
Gotcha!

1232
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:12,503
(all shouting, laughing)

1233
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:13,738
Pull out those smokes, Sam!

1234
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:14,906
Let's fumigate the place!

1235
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:16,541
Oh, you guys.

1236
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:18,860
Diane called us
with the bad news,

1237
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,929
so we thought we'd come
cheer you up, Sam.

1238
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,598
Oh, man, I thought it
was something, you know,

1239
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,799
I had said earlier
might have upset you.

1240
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,867
(Frasier chuckles)

1241
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,369
No, Sam, you got to go a lot

1242
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:29,371
farther than that
to insult us, eh?

1243
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:32,741
Besides, we knew that you were

1244
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,308
going through
a lot of trouble lately.

1245
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:37,195
We're here for you, Sammy,
as long as you need us.

1246
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:40,092
All except for Peterson, who
has to get up in the morning.

1247
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,786
You really know how to sink
a party, don't you, Woody?

1248
00:58:44,853 --> 00:58:47,088
Here's your bus schedule.

1249
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:50,391
When are you up for re-election?

1250
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,052
(scoffs)

1251
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,853
Can you believe it?

1252
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:05,423
I forgot our plane tickets.

1253
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:06,690
Oh, oh, oh.

1254
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:07,992
Sam, I'm glad you're here.

1255
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:09,660
Listen, I wanted to tell you.

1256
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,831
I really, really like Diane.

1257
00:59:12,898 --> 00:59:15,908
And I know you guys are gonna
have a wonderful life together.

1258
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,853
Diane and I are finished, honey.

1259
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:21,505
Ding-dong,
saved by the bell.

1260
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:25,176
Well, I'm off

1261
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:26,344
on my honeymoon.

1262
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:27,912
Good-bye, you guys.

1263
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:31,249
Oh, and, I just want to tell you
that, um, the days that I had

1264
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,985
here at Cheers were the, they
were the best days of my life.

1265
00:59:34,986 --> 00:59:35,970
Really?

1266
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:37,204
Ew.

1267
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:38,723
SAM:
Wh-what are you saying?

1268
00:59:38,724 --> 00:59:40,725
You're not gonna come back
and see us anymore?

1269
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:42,676
No, I will, every now
and then, you know.

1270
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:43,845
But I-I'm married now.

1271
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,380
I-I can't just hang out
in a bar all day long.

1272
00:59:46,448 --> 00:59:49,016
I mean, I-I have my place
in the community.

1273
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,336
Hey, by the way,
did I tell you?

1274
00:59:51,403 --> 00:59:55,239
Don got a job offer
with the sewer department.

1275
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:57,241
Keep your fingers
crossed for us.

1276
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:03,047
Can you believe that?

1277
01:00:03,115 --> 01:00:07,118
I shoot for Donald Trump,
and I end up with Ed Norton.

1278
01:00:09,204 --> 01:00:11,505
But you did good, Rebecca.

1279
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:14,359
I did, didn't I?

1280
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,827
(gasps)

1281
01:00:16,828 --> 01:00:18,363
(giggles):
Bye.

1282
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:20,231
See you, Trixie.

1283
01:00:25,053 --> 01:00:26,821
You know, Sam.
Hmm?

1284
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:28,523
You really scared us
there before.

1285
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,557
Hmm.

1286
01:00:29,558 --> 01:00:30,892
When you walked
out of here today,

1287
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,894
I thought it was the last
we'd ever see of you.

1288
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,094
Yeah, yeah.

1289
01:00:34,095 --> 01:00:35,797
I'm sorry about
blowing up like that.

1290
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,699
I hope you understand
where that was coming from.

1291
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,917
That's all right, Sammy.

1292
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:41,586
We understand.

1293
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:44,189
Here you are
a washed-up ballplayer,

1294
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:46,090
alcohol problem.

1295
01:00:46,158 --> 01:00:47,992
Sex problem.

1296
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,927
Lost your one true love.

1297
01:00:49,928 --> 01:00:50,912
Twice.

1298
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,796
No apology necessary.

1299
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:56,033
Ah.

1300
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:58,135
Yeah, who was
I kidding, you know?

1301
01:00:58,203 --> 01:01:01,439
Coming in here and telling
you guys you don't have lives.

1302
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:05,677
I guess I was really
talking about myself.

1303
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,829
God, the irony.

1304
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,796
Irony.

1305
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:10,731
ALL:
Irony.

1306
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:16,721
One by one, I seem to be losing

1307
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:19,958
my, uh... thrills

1308
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:22,961
and, uh, tingles, you know?

1309
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:24,595
I keep asking myself,

1310
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:27,465
"What-what is
the point to life?"

1311
01:01:27,532 --> 01:01:30,502
Whoo, that's a tough question.

1312
01:01:30,569 --> 01:01:32,604
Yeah.

1313
01:01:32,671 --> 01:01:34,338
Eh.

1314
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:36,207
Well, I got the answer.

1315
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,209
Somehow, I knew you would.

1316
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:44,282
Comfortable shoes.

1317
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:46,201
Shoes?

1318
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,435
Yeah, if you're not
wearing comfortable shoes,

1319
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:49,970
life is just chaos.

1320
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,889
I mean, the greatest
accomplishments in history

1321
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,376
have been made by men
wearing accommodating shoes.

1322
01:01:57,445 --> 01:01:58,913
Uh, Frasier, tell me,

1323
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:01,811
who do you think is the
greatest thinker in all mankind?

1324
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:04,669
I don't know, uh, Aristotle.

1325
01:02:04,737 --> 01:02:06,237
There you go.

1326
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,438
Sandals.

1327
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:11,325
Perhaps the most
comfortable shoe there is.

1328
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:13,494
You hardly even know
you have them on.

1329
01:02:13,562 --> 01:02:17,231
I mean, Confucius, thongs.

1330
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:19,333
Einstein, loose loafers.

1331
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:21,419
Wow.

1332
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,555
I'll tell you
what the point of life is:

1333
01:02:24,623 --> 01:02:27,925
Having kids.

1334
01:02:27,993 --> 01:02:30,628
Creating life.

1335
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:33,798
Sure, it's disappointing
and painful,

1336
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:36,767
heartbreaking at times.

1337
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,470
Sure, they can drive you crazy
and make you think

1338
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:41,528
you just can't get through
another day.

1339
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,577
Where was I going with this?

1340
01:02:46,578 --> 01:02:51,616
You know, some would say
that the search for meaning

1341
01:02:51,617 --> 01:02:53,317
is a, a waste of time,

1342
01:02:53,385 --> 01:02:57,054
that all human life
is just a cosmic accident,

1343
01:02:57,122 --> 01:02:59,957
an arbitrary conglomeration of

1344
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:03,411
molecules evolved by chance

1345
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:06,314
into an organism
with a brain stem,

1346
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,917
condemning it to ponder,
futilely,

1347
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:10,718
the reason behind it all.

1348
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:15,232
I know Dr. Crane
is just trying

1349
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,225
to keep the
conversation lively...

1350
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:23,631
All I know is my life
would have been nothing

1351
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:25,532
if it weren't for all of you.

1352
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,553
You people are as dear to me
as my own family.

1353
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:29,888
More so, in fact.

1354
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:31,839
Really, Woody?
Oh, yeah.

1355
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,924
Well, for one thing,
none of you call me Huckleberry.

1356
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:36,126
I hate being called
Huckleberry.

1357
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:37,528
That's your nickname, Wood?

1358
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:40,297
No, Woody is.

1359
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:51,625
Well...

1360
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:54,261
I hate to get all
mushy, but I got to say

1361
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:57,231
I feel pretty lucky to
have the friends I do.

1362
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:58,349
Ah.

1363
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:02,219
You know, no one wants
to be the first to say it,

1364
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,655
but I'm not ashamed to admit

1365
01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:07,224
what I think we're all feeling.

1366
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:11,095
Time goes by... so fast.

1367
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:13,698
People move in
and out of your life.

1368
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:17,301
You must never miss an
opportunity to tell these people

1369
01:04:17,368 --> 01:04:20,571
how much they mean to you.

1370
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:23,307
Well, I...

1371
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,994
I...

1372
01:04:27,746 --> 01:04:30,565
I...

1373
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:32,249
I...

1374
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:41,458
I keep coming back
to that shoe thing.

1375
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,478
(phone rings)

1376
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:45,612
Ooh, that's Vera.

1377
01:04:45,613 --> 01:04:46,931
That's Lilith.
Probably Kelly.

1378
01:04:46,932 --> 01:04:48,833
Could be Ma.
My kids.

1379
01:04:48,834 --> 01:04:50,201
Say, you know what,
wait, don't answer it.

1380
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:51,602
Just let whoever it is
think that

1381
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,004
we're on our way.
Which is exactly

1382
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:54,605
where we should be.

1383
01:04:54,606 --> 01:04:55,806
(phone stops ringing)

1384
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,241
Hey, uh,

1385
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:58,776
thanks for
the Perfecto, Sammy. Yeah.

1386
01:04:58,777 --> 01:05:00,895
Thanks for staying guys.

1387
01:05:00,962 --> 01:05:02,680
Same to you.

1388
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:04,665
Wouldn't be the same
without you, Sam.

1389
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,600
CLIFF:
Yep.

1390
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:09,020
Whatever guy follows you, Sam,

1391
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:12,123
has some pretty
big shoes to fill.

1392
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:14,391
Did you hear that?

1393
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:16,393
Thus, it all returns
to footwear.

1394
01:05:19,064 --> 01:05:21,315
Night, you guys.

1395
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:23,217
You know, I still keep
thinking though, uh,

1396
01:05:23,218 --> 01:05:27,521
you know, I want some kind
of change in my life.

1397
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:29,440
You know something?

1398
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,675
I hate change.

1399
01:05:31,743 --> 01:05:33,077
I mean, you know,

1400
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:35,513
every day, you wake up,
something's changed.

1401
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,116
Everything's just
changing so fast.

1402
01:05:38,183 --> 01:05:40,684
I like things to stay
the way they are, you know?

1403
01:05:40,752 --> 01:05:42,753
I like things you can count on.

1404
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:46,090
You know, you just gave me
something to think about, Woody.

1405
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:47,725
Oh, I'm sorry, Sam.

1406
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:50,594
I hate it when somebody
does that to me.

1407
01:05:50,662 --> 01:05:52,496
Bye, Woody.

1408
01:05:52,564 --> 01:05:54,432
Night, Sam.

1409
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:05,410
Sammy,

1410
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:07,728
I didn't want to say this
in front of the others,

1411
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:09,229
but you know what I think

1412
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:12,016
the most important thing
in life is?

1413
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,318
It's love.

1414
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:15,953
You want to know what I love?

1415
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:18,423
Beer, Norm?

1416
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,858
Yeah, I'll have a quick one.

1417
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:31,101
Know what, Sammy,
I love that stool!

1418
01:06:31,169 --> 01:06:33,187
If there's a heaven,

1419
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:36,157
I don't want to go there unless
my stool is waiting for me.

1420
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,755
And I'll tell you what,
even God better not be on it.

1421
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:40,961
He wouldn't...

1422
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:42,763
he wouldn't dare.

1423
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:44,165
(sighs)

1424
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:47,034
I don't think it matters
what you love, Sammy.

1425
01:06:47,102 --> 01:06:49,470
Could be a person,
could be a thing.

1426
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,506
As long as you love it totally,

1427
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:55,209
completely, without judgment.

1428
01:06:57,379 --> 01:06:59,646
Know what I think?

1429
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,949
I think you ought to go
home and wake up Vera

1430
01:07:02,017 --> 01:07:04,451
with a big
kiss and then (sighs)

1431
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:06,220
do what comes naturally.

1432
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:10,124
Wake her up so she can watch me
eat a bucket of buffalo wings?

1433
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,035
Yeah, well, maybe not.

1434
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,153
(sighs)

1435
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,405
Well, I'm off.

1436
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,074
(sighs)

1437
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:29,743
But, um, Sammy, can I let you in
on a little secret?

1438
01:07:29,811 --> 01:07:31,395
Sure.

1439
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:33,731
I knew you'd come back.

1440
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,566
You did?

1441
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:40,454
You can never be unfaithful
to your one true love.

1442
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,423
You always come back to her.

1443
01:07:46,378 --> 01:07:48,312
Who is that?

1444
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:52,299
Think about it, Sam.

1445
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:17,341
(chuckles softly)

1446
01:08:20,244 --> 01:08:21,379
Boy, I'll tell you...

1447
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:27,418
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch on Earth.

1448
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:40,331
(footsteps approaching)

1449
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:42,550
(knocking)

1450
01:08:46,955 --> 01:08:49,773
Sorry, we're closed.
