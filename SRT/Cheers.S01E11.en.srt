1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,277
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,868
Can you see if the table's ready
for Phillips?

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,355
Sure. Be glad to.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,718
What was the name again?

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,554
- Phillips.
- Phillips!

6
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,392
Lock up your daughters!

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,156
The fightin' Double Deuce
is on the loose!

8
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,150
- Can l help you?
- You should help me.

9
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,114
l helped you. l fought the Kaiser
when your daddy was in diapers.

10
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,559
- Where's the rest of my outfit?
- What you got on looks silly enough.

11
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,478
l mean the other boys from the 22nd
Brigade. l'm meeting them here.

12
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,592
l hope you're not expecting
a whole brigade? l'm low on lemons.

13
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,919
No, just the guys from my squad.
What's left of 'em. l'm Buzz Crowder.

14
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,558
Sam, l got this one. Buzz, l'm
the fella you talked to this morning.

15
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,148
l didn't recognise the uniform
on the telephone.

16
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,068
Come on. Let me show you
the back room. lt's in the back.

17
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,950
Sorry about that.
Can l get you a drink?

18
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,154
l don't drink. But keep plenty for
the others. Lotta catching up to do.

19
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,955
We meet in this bar
every ten years to reminisce.

20
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,991
What war were you in?

21
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,350
The First World War, of course.

22
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,950
ls that the one
with Clark Gable or Gary Cooper?

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,958
Wow! l'm 85. What's your excuse?

24
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,518
Baseball!

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,958
- What you writing, Slats?
- My thoughts.

26
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,753
That would explain
all the blank pages.

27
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,875
l'm writing during the odd moments
of the job, much as Jack London did.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,150
Was he a bad waitress, too?

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,912
Ladies, please. Enough girl talk.

30
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,158
Any sex in it?

31
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,799
l've started writing down bits
of conversation l hear in the bar.

32
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,233
Sometimes people say things that
strike me as snippets of Americana.

33
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,159
You mean things said by
customers, employees?

34
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,430
- Yeah.
- The owner?

35
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,630
l'm afraid you're not represented.

36
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,156
Just my luck.
She doesn't like my snippets.

37
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,678
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

38
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,360
- What you up to, Norm?
- My ears.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,150
- Want a beer, Norm?
- Does a rag doll have cloth knobs?

40
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,949
There's a lady present, Norm.

41
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,475
Sorry, Diane.

42
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,431
Shot of bourbon.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,549
Sir? Save your quarter.
That piano hasn't worked in 20 years.

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,992
Use the jukebox. lt doesn't work
either, but it's only a dime.

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,475
Sammy,
why keep something that doesn't work?

46
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Cos no-one else'll give her a job!

47
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,952
Ladies!

48
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,349
- Got something good there?
- Yes.

49
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,836
A remark a customer dropped
just a moment ago.

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,349
Yeah? A quotable remark?

51
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,270
Well, it occurs to me that sometimes
we find truth comes in a glass.

52
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,556
Or a mug.

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,556
Or your face.

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,477
Pinky!

55
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,352
You old grunt!

56
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,040
Sammy...? Tinkerbell here, or what?

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,197
Buzz? lsn't he a bit young
to be one of your guys?

58
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,955
Of course! l'm sorry.

59
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,236
From behind you look like
the young Pinky Peterson.

60
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,193
You shouldn't grab people like that.

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,475
lf l buy you a beer,
will you forget it?

62
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,433
Buy me a pitcher,
you can kiss me on the lips!

63
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,392
You're alright. l'll be in the back.

64
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,033
Everything alright back there?

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,674
Well, that room is kinda small.

66
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,394
One grenade'll get us all!

67
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,356
This looks like a nice saloon.

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,675
We aspire to saloon.

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,358
Can l just sit anywhere?

70
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,155
Try the bar. lt makes good cover
during the gunfights.

71
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,953
Hi. What'll you have?

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,753
l'll have a carafe
of your house whisky.

73
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,398
- Excuse me?
- ls that a bad order?

74
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,954
Not if you're a party of twenty.

75
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,672
- This is my first time in a bar.
- No kidding.

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,713
Really. l was just passing
and dropped in to see what it's like.

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,832
Does it live up to your expectations?

78
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,238
l expected to see more lost,
desperate souls sitting around.

79
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,476
Desperate souls night is Thursday.

80
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,273
All the beer you can cry into
for a buck.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,673
- That's very amusing.
- Thank you.

82
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,631
Where's Diane?

83
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,877
l've never had hard liquor
in my life.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,673
You see, it's my last day
in the secular world.

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,519
Tomorrow, l'm going into a monastery.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,594
So this is kind of your last fling?

87
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,950
First and last.

88
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,952
l'll give you a drink. But
take it easy, it sneaks up on you.

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,956
- l once thought of being a priest.
- You're religious?

90
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,913
No, l just thought
it'd be a nice, peaceful life.

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,598
Allow me to dispel
your misconceptions.

92
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,756
Thank you, Father.

93
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,352
Can l get you something, Buzz?

94
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,995
Not yet, Sam. l came out
to warn you about something.

95
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,556
Me and the boys have got
a little joke we play on each other.

96
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,070
First man here
always goes in the back room,

97
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,158
strips down to his altogether,
yeah?

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,989
Then he stands on the table,

99
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,271
and when the others walk in,
he yells out,

100
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,356
''Lafayette, we are here!''

101
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,557
- Well, tonight it's my turn.
- Thanks for the warning, Buzz.

102
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,713
Sam,... could you turn the heat up
just a little bit?

103
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,750
A monk?

104
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,153
Does that mean
you have to give up...?

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,955
Well, as the French
so delicately put it, the old...?

106
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,839
l have to take a vow of chastity.
l also have to take a vow of silence.

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,350
Yep, give up sex,
you might as well give up talkin'.

108
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,237
What fun is messing around
if you can't tell the guys.

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,479
lt's no big deal. l never had
much luck with girls, anyway.

110
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,556
They don't find me attractive.

111
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,073
Kev, you're an attractive guy.

112
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,156
- Diane?
- Yeah?

113
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,514
Don't you think he's a specimen?

114
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,278
Yes. He's a very attractive fellow.

115
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,358
Come on,
l know l don't have any sex appeal.

116
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,951
l'm shy, l'm serious-minded...
The search goes on for my chin.

117
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,555
Kevin, speaking as a woman,

118
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,037
l'm glad you're going in a monastery.
You could be a real heartbreaker.

119
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,996
You're not a... bambo, are you?

120
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,156
No... A bimbo.

121
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,954
No, it's bimbo, not bambo,

122
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,753
and l'm not one. But you are.

123
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,553
Attractive. Yeah, attractive.

124
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,952
What a great girl!

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,348
Sam, is she taken?

126
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,471
Only with herself.

127
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,672
One drink in four hours.
ls that called nursing it?

128
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,156
No, that's called
bringing it back from the dead.

129
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,993
l hate to admit it
but Carla just got in the book.

130
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,829
l always say, ''Nurse a drink,
starve a bartender.''

131
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,712
Excuse me, Sam.

132
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,995
Smite me again, barkeep!

133
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,272
- Sure you want another one?
- Yes, l'm rather enjoying myself.

134
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,757
OK, l'll make this one weaker.
No charge for the water.

135
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,074
You needn't worry.

136
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,193
l know l'm a novice drinker, but l've
only had one since l got here.

137
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,788
l'm not ready for the lampshade yet.

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,670
Excuse me.

139
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,794
You know, Sam, that Kevin'll make a
great monk. He's got a good attitude.

140
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,070
- Diane?
- Yes?

141
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,838
l want you!

142
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,557
Diane, are you OK?

143
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,749
l'm OK. l'm fine.
l'd like to go freshen up a bit.

144
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,757
Absolutely. You OK?

145
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,555
Lafayette, we are here!

146
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,356
Here's a little-known fact.
Most of you probably assume

147
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,869
basketball was invented in the US,
right?

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,956
James Naismith, Springfield College.

149
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,674
Good thing l showed up tonight.

150
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,473
Basketball was invented
thousands of years ago

151
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,909
by the Mayans.
They played it for centuries.

152
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,871
- ls that true?
- Sure.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,877
Watch me get the Coach on it.

154
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,551
Coach. Got a question for you.
Who invented basketball?

155
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,275
- The Mayans.
- Where did you hear that?

156
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,836
How do l know? Must've been
a Mayan in here bragging about it.

157
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
Buy 'em, Sammy.
Comeback time, let's go.

158
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,119
Can l have your attention?

159
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,074
l've been drinking all evening.
Now l have something to say.

160
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,760
lt's down the hall to the left.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,753
First, l'd like to make
a public apology

162
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,759
to the young lady l insulted earlier.
l lost my head.

163
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,350
- Don't worry about it.
- Apology accepted, Kevin.

164
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,356
Second, may l thank you all
for helping me see the light.

165
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,677
lt is clear now
l am not fit for the monastery.

166
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,678
l succumb too easily
to the pleasures of the flesh.

167
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,870
That's OK. Don't worry about it.

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,831
Tonight...

169
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,110
Tonight has proven
that l belong here, in a bar,

170
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,152
drinking booze
with seedy degenerates,

171
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,999
and getting slapped around
by cheap dames.

172
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,951
Kevin, it's our pleasure.

173
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,394
l'm gonna give you
a real man's drink. Coffee.

174
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,195
- Coffee? Men drink that?
- Men who've had too much to drink.

175
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,070
- OK, Norm, pay up.
- Whaddaya say?

176
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,509
Double or nothing on the highlights?

177
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,514
- Sam, any of my squad check in?
- Not yet, Buzz.

178
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,756
Maybe l won't wait for 'em.

179
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,638
Send me back a ginger ale.

180
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,993
Sam, l want a drink only men drink,
something that makes women sick.

181
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,917
l'll give you some more coffee.

182
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,395
No, l want something stronger.

183
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,511
l'll give you yesterday's coffee.

184
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,949
Kevin...

185
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,757
lt's a big day ahead. How will you
feel, entering a monastery hungover?

186
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,155
l'm serious, Sam. l'm not going.

187
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,750
- Kevin, you're drunk.
- l am?

188
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,871
Believe me,
l know what l'm talkin' about.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,389
What about your calling, Kevin?

190
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,830
l never had a calling.
l talked myself into believing that.

191
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,473
l've always been an ordinary person.
l thought it'd make me special.

192
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,388
He's discovered forever is
a long time to go between hayrides.

193
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,276
You're gonna turn your back on God
because of sex?

194
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,790
Believe me, sex
is not that important.

195
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,675
Well, it's not!

196
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,472
Can sex make stars,

197
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,751
or a tree or a rainbow?

198
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,554
Can sex make an ocean
or a newborn baby?

199
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,432
Forget that one.

200
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,756
l know just what she means.
l once had a religious experience

201
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,589
just watching a hummingbird,
hovering next to a flower.

202
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,752
lt's almost impossible to imagine
something hanging in mid-air so long.

203
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,553
l guess you never saw
one of my curve balls.

204
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,479
You all think a man can't change
his life in one evening. But l have.

205
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,955
l wanna be a regular guy.

206
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,038
l wanna arm wrestle
and tell crude jokes

207
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,151
and spit on the floor.

208
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,759
And l wanna dance with cheap women.

209
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,155
Carla, let's dance.

210
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,914
Put that in your notebook,
l break your fingers.

211
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,272
Kevin, sit down for a second.

212
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,359
l wanna dance. l'm having the time
of my life. l don't want it to end.

213
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,198
That doesn't even work.

214
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,151
lt doesn't? Well, then...

215
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,430
- l thought you said it was broken.
- lt it. lt was. For twenty years.

216
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,879
My God!

217
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,196
Kevin, you realise what this means?

218
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,675
l've healed a piano?

219
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,678
lt's a miracle or something.

220
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,679
Wait, miracles don't happen.
Are you sure it was broken?

221
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,155
Yes. The motor was rusted solid.

222
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,271
How could this happen?

223
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,675
Maybe something or somebody's

224
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,916
trying to tell you
what to do with your life.

225
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,156
Get into piano repair.

226
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,551
No, wait a minute.
What are you trying to say?

227
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,437
Kevin, you said
you're an ordinary person.

228
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,030
Maybe you're not.
Maybe you have a direction.

229
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,476
- You might as well try and find out.
- You're right.

230
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,991
l've come too far to let one night
in a fleshpot change my whole life.

231
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,350
- Yes.
- Thank you.

232
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,755
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

233
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,750
- Thank you.
- Hey, kid, alright!

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,558
Thank you.

235
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,952
You're welcome!

236
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,358
Good night, Kev!

237
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,869
- Bye, Kevin.
- See you in church!

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,230
Good night.

239
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,116
Boy, that was inspiring!

240
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,028
- Sam, did you get that piano fixed?
- No, l didn't... Did you?

241
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,390
Yeah, a couple of days ago.

242
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,031
l meant to tell you about it
but it slipped my mind.

243
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,109
Coach, why did you find it inspiring
if you got the piano fixed?

244
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,155
Gee, Diane, that piano's been busted
for what, twenty years?

245
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,669
Why did l suddenly decide
to get it fixed?

246
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,950
This would make a great bar story.

247
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,352
Too bad we're all here.

248
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,078
- Poor Buzz. He's breaking my heart.
- None of his buddies showed?

249
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
No. He's back there alone,
throwing darts.

250
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,555
- He's been at it an hour and a half.
- Poor guy.

251
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,959
They'll never make a pack big enough
to carry the loneliness of a soldier.

252
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,550
Nah!

253
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,153
Sam...

254
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,277
What do l owe ya, Sam?

255
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,237
Nothing, Buzz. The room's on us.
Forget it.

256
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,157
Why, thanks.

257
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,077
Hey, Buzz?

258
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,919
l was in the army myself. Fort Dix.

259
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,555
Yeah, l served in the navy, Buzz.
ln Pensacola.

260
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,436
l was in the reserves.

261
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,110
l was never in the Army, but l did
serve in uniform. l was a Brownie.

262
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,678
l won merit badges.

263
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,151
l was in Saint Cletus's Correctional
lnstitute for Wayward Girls.

264
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,955
We used Brownies for firewood!

265
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,949
You know? Every reunion we've had
has... thinned out a little more.

266
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,560
l guess this is the last one.

267
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,156
l guess l'm the last one.

268
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,716
Or maybe they just forgot. People
get busy, make other commitments.

269
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,319
Yeah.

270
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,831
Maybe their lives aren't going well,
so they don't wanna come see you.

271
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,155
Maybe they never liked you.

272
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,357
Those guys would never just forget.

273
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,752
No, not after the things
we went through together.

274
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,556
No, sir.

275
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,555
l'm gonna miss these reunions.

276
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,358
Wait. lf you want some buddies
to get together with, we're here.

277
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,948
We're not old coots like you,
but we feel like we know ya.

278
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,752
lntimately!

279
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,997
Look, Buzz, maybe we could have
a reunion every ten years.

280
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,556
Why ten?
What's wrong with every year?

281
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,756
How's about every week?

282
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,950
Every ten years will be fine.

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,873
Come on, Pinky,
l'll beat ya at darts!

284
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,151
Yeah? We'll see about that.
Come on, everybody.

285
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,354
You don't need me now, do you?
l've got an early class tomorrow.

286
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,153
- No, that's alright. You can go.
- Thanks.

287
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,356
You know something? Loneliness is
a good thing to share with someone.

288
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,556
Wow...

289
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,952
Wow?

290
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,352
''...someone.''

291
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,591
Would you get my purse for me?
This has been a great day.

292
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,756
How could l have known when l woke up

293
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,350
that l would meet a monk
and a doughboy?

294
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,949
Two men with one foot in heaven.
That's good!

295
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,155
Wait. Wait a second...

296
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,315
lt's not like this is important to me
or anything,

297
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,831
but are you aware l'm the only person
in this bar who's not in that book?

298
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,553
Really?

299
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,558
When l played baseball,
l was quoted all the time.

300
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,434
Reporters hung around, waiting
for me to say something intelligent.

301
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,755
l know the feeling!

302
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,239
Sam, come on, that was a joke!

303
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,591
No, it's not. You think
l'm too dumb to be in that book.

304
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,077
Sam, there are a lot of people in
this book just as dumb as you are.

305
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,958
Now, look.

306
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,230
l want natural poetry, OK?

307
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,750
l want spontaneous statements.
You've been trying too hard.

308
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,351
Fine! l don't want to be in that
stupid, pretentious book, anyway.

309
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,756
You've been writing
some pretty stupid stuff in it.

310
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,553
l've heard some of that stuff.
lt's stupid.

311
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,956
What does a stuffed shirt know
about blue-collar poetry?

312
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,310
That's good, that's really good.

313
