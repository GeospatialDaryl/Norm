00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,400
PERSONAL BUSINESS

2
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:10,737
I got it.
Yeah, thank you, Vic.

3
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:14,157
TabIe ready upstairs at MeIviIIe's
for the Anderson party.

4
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:17,744
TabIe ready for the Anderson party.

5
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:19,954
- Your name is Anderson?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,500
I guess there must be
two Anderson parties.

7
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:27,837
- What's the first name?
- Ernie, but they caII me Coach.

8
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,507
There are two Anderson parties here.

9
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:33,677
WouId you caII upstairs
and find out who gets the tabIe?

10
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,887
Good idea.

11
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:40,684
Vic, we've got a probIem.
There are two Anderson parties.

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,771
Which one is it?
Oh, thanks, Vic.

13
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:50,777
Thanks. I got it, Vic. I'm sorry,
I was wrong. It's not for the Andersons.

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,614
It's for the BIubberbutts.

15
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:58,993
TabIe ready for the BIubberbutts!
TabIe ready for the BIubberbutts!

16
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:14,444
DyIan Thomas, DeImore Schwartz,
FitzgeraId, FauIkner...

17
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:18,740
they aII drank themseIves to death.
Gone before their time.

18
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:21,743
So, can I get you another round?

19
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:29,459
- Diane's mouth has sprung a Ieak again.
- Excuse me? We have to Ieave.

20
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:32,754
- CouId we get our waitress now?
- Sure.

21
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:36,257
Here's my theory on the reIationship
between aIcohoI and genius.

22
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,593
Writing is a IoneIy profession.
You know...

23
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,847
Excuse me for a moment.
CarIa! CarIa!

24
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:46,809
- PIease! PIease! CarIa!
- Here you go.

25
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:50,396
- CouId we get our cheque pIease?
- CertainIy.

26
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:55,193
CarIa, I've toId you before,
keep your hands off Diane.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,987
I wiII if you wiII.

28
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:04,327
CarIa... I have two things to say to you.

29
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:06,955
First, don't ever do that again

30
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,540
or you'II regret it
for the rest of your Iife.

31
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:13,670
And second, wouId this be
a bad time to ask you for a favour?

32
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,547
For you, there's no good time.

33
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:20,510
WeII then, I wouId greatIy appreciate it
if you wouId switch scheduIes with me

34
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:22,845
so that I can have next Tuesday off.

35
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:25,223
No!

36
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,395
CarIa, Oriana FaIIaci is giving a speech
at Harvard.

37
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:34,190
Come on, pIease.
You've gotta change with me.

38
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:37,485
I don't have to do nothing.
Before I do a favour for you,

39
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:41,864
I wouId rather be dragged around town
by my tongue.

40
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:47,662
Since you don't feeI strongIy about it,
maybe Sam wouId Iike to decide for us.

41
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,874
Ha! I'd rather fIip a coin.
At Ieast that way I'd have a chance.

42
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:57,964
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means that since you two started...

43
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:02,635
you know... She gets away with things
the rest of us wouIdn't.

44
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:06,013
- I beg your pardon!
- CarIa, maybe you're right.

45
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,558
Maybe I have been too easy on her.

46
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:12,854
I'II take her in the back room
and teach her some obedience.

47
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:21,696
I've got no feeIings
about what you two do in private,

48
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:26,743
no matter how disgusting,
sickening and putrid it is.

49
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:29,245
I just don't think the rest of us
shouId suffer for it.

50
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:33,291
CarIa, aII I asked you to do
was switch nights off with me

51
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,501
and you turn it into a verbaI Iynching.

52
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:38,379
What's the big deaI?
Changing one night?

53
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,132
There you go again, taking her side!

54
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,429
OK, aII right.

55
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:51,100
Diane, work Tuesday night
and Iet's just forget this whoIe thing.

56
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:55,813
Sam, you obviousIy don't reaIise
how important this speech is to me.

57
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,568
It's onIy one night, CarIa.

58
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:03,821
Hey, Diane, I think if you...

59
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,619
CarIa, come on, wiII...
Does anyone want to buy a bar?

60
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:13,289
Sam, reIax.
It's not fair to put you through this.

61
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:18,252
- CarIa, you don't have to switch
- Oh, good...good...

62
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:23,466
- I've just come to an important decision.
- Good for you.

63
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,136
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

64
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:30,556
- Norman!
- WouId you Iike a beer, Norm?

65
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:33,851
I'd Iike to see
something in a size 54 sudsy.

66
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:37,730
- So how's Iife treating you, Norm?
- The same.

67
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:41,651
- That's too bad, Norm.
- If not worse.

68
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,237
- What's wrong, Normie?
- Nothing.

69
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:47,907
- LittIe personaI probIem.
- If it's anything you wanna taIk about...

70
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:51,661
Nah, I thought I'd sit here
and Iet it gnaw at my gut for a whiIe.

71
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:54,997
Now, Normie, come on.
You're among friends here.

72
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,917
If you can't taIk to us,
who can you taIk to?

73
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:02,838
Not Vera, that's for sure.
She and I have spIit.

74
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:06,717
- I'm sorry.
- What happened? What caused it?

75
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,720
She said we no Ionger communicate,

76
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,390
that I never Iisten to her,
a bunch of other stuff.

77
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:14,558
Yak, yak, yak.

78
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:19,230
Cheer up, Norm, maybe...
maybe this'II be good for you somehow.

79
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:21,565
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absoIuteIy. Look at it this way.

80
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:27,029
- You are a free man now, Norm.
- A carefree bacheIor.

81
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:29,991
- Yeah, I do have a pad now.
- Where is it?

82
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,244
You know that big beautifuI buiIding
down by the waterfront?

83
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,122
You take a Ieft there,
you drive for about a haIf an hour...

84
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,501
- Don't come at night.
- This is gonna be a new Iife for you.

85
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,588
- You just gotta get up and around a bit.
- I don't know.

86
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:48,592
- Come on, man. Come on.
- What are you waiting for?

87
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,680
- Come on, Norm.
- AII right. I'm gonna do it.

88
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,064
Stand back, I'm on the prowI.

89
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:15,327
SIow up.

90
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:19,623
Come on, man.

91
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:30,551
- That was awfuIIy quick, Norm.
- They know where to find me.

92
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,178
Sam?

93
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,388
- Read this.
- What is it?

94
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,599
- My resignation.
- Your what?

95
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,809
Read it.

96
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,020
''Dear Sam...

97
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,943
''AIthough my tenure here has been one
of vaIue and enIightenment, stiII...''

98
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,654
<i>ll faut cultiver notre jardin.</i>

99
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,742
Come on!

100
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,703
First, nobody resigns from a bar

101
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,748
and second, nobody resigns in Latin.

102
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,669
- It's French, Sammy.
- What does it mean, CIiff?

103
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:11,133
Because of the idiomatic pecuIiarities,
it can't reaIIy be transIated into EngIish.

104
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,721
''One must cuItivate one's own garden.''

105
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:21,810
Diane, you took some Iiberties
with the derogatory tense there but...

106
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:24,813
I think we'II Iet it sIide this time?

107
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,733
What the heII's this about?

108
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,694
It's because
I didn't take your side against CarIa?

109
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,865
No, Sam. The probIem
with CarIa is onIy a symptom.

110
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:36,867
You see...

111
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:42,957
it's cIear that our working together
is making our Iives miserabIe.

112
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:47,294
Diane, you just can't Ieave Iike that.
We shouId have a party.

113
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:52,591
Some booze, a Iot of pretzeIs, some
munchies, get a Iot of peopIe together.

114
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:58,806
- You mean, Iike this?
- WeII, I guess that's goodbye, Diane.

115
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:04,520
Sam, you don't need me tonight.
I wanna go home and start pIanning.

116
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:10,276
CarIa, what's the matter, sweetheart?
Are you aII right?

117
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:14,947
Don't you see?

118
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:20,327
My Iife hasn't exactIy been a bag of
roses, you know.

119
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:26,750
My oId man used to beat me. I
spent haIf my chiIdhood in reform schooI.

120
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:31,797
My husband was a rat who Ieft me
with four hungry mouths to feed.

121
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,008
But this...

122
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,343
makes up for aII that.

123
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:42,474
I am the happiest woman aIive.

124
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:45,102
You know, I'm sorry.
I think this is a mistake.

125
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,855
It's a tough town out there...
Norm, am I right?

126
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:52,359
Most empIoyers wouIdn't spit on you
if your hair was on fire.

127
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:57,281
But you'II make it, kid.
I know you wiII. You've got moxie.

128
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:00,492
I know. You aII think I'm nothing

129
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,789
but an orchid, unequipped to survive
in anything but a rarefied atmosphere.

130
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:09,626
I'II have you know,
there's weed in me.

131
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:14,548
What a fareweII speech.
It went on exactIy the right Iength.

132
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:19,094
Any more wouId have been
too much of a good thing.

133
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,139
Hey, you're reaIIy going to do this,
aren't you?

134
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:26,935
- Sam, I'm doing this for us.
- ReaIIy?

135
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:32,441
Yes. Now don't you want to spend
your nights with a woman who's fuIfiIIed,

136
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:35,402
independent, seIf-actuaIised?

137
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,781
I suppose it's worth a shot.
You got her number?

138
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:57,109
- HeIIo, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

139
00:10:57,276 --> 00:11:00,488
I have wonderfuI news. I've got a job!

140
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:04,033
- Write us about it.
- Good for you.

141
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,164
I know you aII thought I was a sociaI
misfit, unabIe to function on the streets.

142
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:14,043
WeII, I not onIy got a job,
I've got a great job!

143
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,547
I'm a proofreader for a smaII pubIishing
house. Isn't that perfect for me?

144
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:20,758
I'm proud of you.

145
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:24,011
WeII, it's been two weeks of heII,
but I did it.

146
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:26,222
What's going on here, Norm?

147
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:30,184
You been Iooking for months and
Diane snags a job in a coupIe of weeks?

148
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,394
WeII, it's easier for girIs.

149
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,981
If God had made me a woman,
I'd never be out of work.

150
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:40,945
WeII, yeah,
as Iong as there are carnivaIs.

151
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:51,121
You know, I was scepticaI
about you finding something,

152
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:56,877
but I guess it won't kiII me
to come out and say...congratuIations!

153
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:59,088
Thank you, CarIa.

154
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,681
CarIa, get up, wiII ya?

155
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:18,107
- So, when do you start?
- I'm not sure yet.

156
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,401
How come?

157
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:25,948
The job isn't exactIy, officiaIIy,
technicaIIy, compIeteIy, finaIIy definite.

158
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,450
- You don't have the job?
- No. I've got it.

159
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,787
I poured out my heart for nothing?

160
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:36,208
CarIa, CarIa, I have the job!
I have the job!

161
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,134
It's just that there's one smaII formaIity
that has to be taken care of.

162
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:51,307
- And that's what?
- Mr Hedges wants a reference.

163
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:58,480
He'II caII you tonight. You wiII say
wonderfuI things about me, won't you?

164
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,567
- Sam, we'II need more red wine here.
- OK.

165
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:05,988
I wiII teII him that you are the best
cocktaiI waitress I've ever seen.

166
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,742
And then I'II teII him that I'd Iike to
seII him some Iand in FIorida that I own.

167
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:13,871
No kidding? Where is it?
We might be neighbours.

168
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:19,418
I wonder what Vera's doing tonight.

169
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:22,838
By the way, Normie,
how did you and Vera meet?

170
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,799
Didn't I teII you?
We were in schooI together.

171
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:27,760
We were?

172
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:31,764
- Not you and I. Vera and I.
- Good.

173
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,643
She was a cute IittIe thing back then.

174
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,146
Boy, couId she give a hickey.

175
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:42,191
Famous aII over the Midwest for it.

176
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:48,489
She gave me one the night of the senior
prom. It Iasted tiII a year ago Christmas.

177
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:55,662
- Give her a caII, big feIIa.
- I don't think so.

178
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,664
Normie?

179
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:00,834
Yeah, I probabIy
shouId just see how she's doing.

180
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,421
- Here, Normie. Save a dime. Wait.
- Thanks, Coach.

181
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,015
Vera? It's Norm.

182
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,811
How are you doing?
Great.

183
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:23,607
So, what are you up to?

184
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:29,196
You have a date? Yes, I'm hurt.

185
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,991
I know it's been two weeks, but...

186
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:37,287
You know, it so happens
that I have a date myseIf.

187
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:40,624
Yeah, I've been getting around.
You don't beIieve me?

188
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,420
She's right here.
You can taIk to her yourseIf.

189
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,132
HeIIo.

190
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:55,347
Mrs Peterson,
thank you for Ietting Normie go.

191
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,558
He's such an animaI.

192
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:03,063
I've never known a man who can thriII
me the way he does.

193
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,441
He touches me and I'm a woman.

194
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:09,987
A totaI, quivering woman.

195
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,993
AII right. Thanks, CarIa.

196
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,162
Say, CarIa, wanna...

197
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,043
maybe get some coffee or something?

198
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,337
Get reaI.

199
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:32,634
Yeah, Cheers.

200
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,887
Yeah, he's in the back.
Who can I say is caIIing?

201
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:38,473
- Hedges?
- Coach, that's my boss!

202
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,227
Are you the Ducky Hedges
who owes me 50 bucks?

203
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,858
- Anybody can say they're not him!
- No, Coach!

204
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,527
What coIour was Red WiIson's hair?

205
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,779
Ducky!

206
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:56,742
You bet I'm an idiot
for ever Ioaning you 50 bucks!

207
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:58,952
You no good chiseIIer!

208
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:04,708
I Ioaned you that money and you
thought I'd forget. WeII, I fooIed ya!

209
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:09,629
- Coach, come on, Iet me have it.
- Give it back when you're through.

210
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,798
HeIIo?

211
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:15,719
Yeah, this is Sam MaIone.
No, I've been expecting your caII.

212
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:19,598
You want to know about Diane
Chambers? I can make this simpIe.

213
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:24,144
She's...she's briIIiant,
she's competent, she's efficient.

214
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:27,606
I recommend her compIeteIy.

215
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:32,444
What's that?
Yeah, what do you wanna know?

216
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,615
I don't think
I wanna answer that question.

217
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:39,618
- No, I don't think I wanna answer it.
- Answer it!

218
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:42,621
Yeah, I've seen her naked.

219
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:58,470
Mr Hedges, this is Diane Chambers.
You are the most rotten, disgusting pig.

220
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:01,973
I wouIdn't work for you if it was...
How much?

221
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,184
Does that incIude medicaI?

222
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:09,439
What am I saying? I wouIdn't take
your job if it were the Iast in Boston!

223
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:14,194
- ToId him, Diane.
- I can kiss that 50 bucks goodbye.

224
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:23,537
- He's onIy interested in my body.
- Sometimes I'm ashamed to be a guy.

225
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:30,210
But if I made the switch now,
I'd have to buy a whoIe new wardrobe.

226
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:32,629
Men are beginning to reaIIy disgust me.

227
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:35,966
- Even more than before.
- Come on!

228
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:38,593
Lighten up!
I mean one rotten appIe doesn't...

229
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,805
No, not one.
We're taIking orchards here.

230
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:49,104
The few scant offers I've had for a job
have aII had sexuaI strings attached.

231
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:52,232
It makes me crazy
thinking of those guys

232
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,651
treating my squeeze Iike a sex object.

233
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:58,989
Here, here.

234
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:04,160
WeII, I guess I'm not going to get any
pureIy professionaI offers.

235
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:08,498
Why don't you come back to the bar?
This is where you beIong.

236
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:14,004
This is where your peopIe are, where
your friends are, where your big guy are.

237
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:18,341
- Where my heart are.
- Yeah.

238
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:21,052
Hey, guys, I think she's coming back.

239
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:31,271
Hey, why don't you
Iet me go get my coat...

240
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:35,483
and then we'II go over to my pIace...

241
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,904
and we'II ceIebrate your homecoming?

242
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:42,365
- Great.
- You may need this.

243
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:06,014
- Sam? I was just thinking...
- Oh, yeah?

244
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:09,601
I tried that once. Never cared for it.
Come on. Let's go.

245
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,980
- Sam!
- Nice?

246
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,277
Why did you rehire me just now?

247
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,989
I hired you because
you're the best combination

248
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:27,410
girIfriend-waitress in the city.
And you stink as a waitress.

249
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:29,788
- ExactIy what I thought!
- What?

250
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:33,249
You hired me for sexuaI purposes.

251
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,044
Just Iike that swine,
Mr Hedges, wanted to do.

252
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:42,592
- Come on! It's compIeteIy different.
- How is it compIeteIy different?

253
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,304
WeII, it...

254
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,681
AII right, for instance...

255
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:51,601
you're nuts about me.

256
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:57,607
Yes, but who knows, in time
I may have become nuts about him.

257
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:01,402
We had a few things in common.

258
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,072
We both find me adorabIe.

259
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,866
- This is serious!
- AII right.

260
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:11,621
How can I come back knowing
you think of me as nothing but your...

261
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,832
handmaiden?

262
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,837
You know, Diane...

263
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:24,050
it gets me the way you women are
aIways taIking about sex on the job.

264
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,553
I mean, as if you were the onIy victims.

265
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:32,058
- What about me?
- What about you?

266
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:35,562
You took this job
because you wanted to be a waitress?

267
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,398
AbsoIuteIy not. I...

268
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:42,110
I had a burning desire
to discover and expIore

269
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:45,071
this vein of American cuIture.

270
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:51,786
BuII! You had a burning desire
to expIore Mount Sammy here.

271
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:58,084
- What are you saying?
- You took this job because I'm here.

272
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:02,922
- You had sex on your mind, too.
- That's not true!

273
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,675
Not entireIy true!

274
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,304
How do you think it makes me feeI

275
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,767
to know that the first time you saw me
you undressed me with your eyes.

276
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:18,938
You had no regard for my dignity
as a man and an empIoyer.

277
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:23,860
I was just a chaIIenge to you.
Another notch on your beIt.

278
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:26,154
I am a person. I have dignity too.

279
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,742
I know you have no regard for this job.

280
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,995
And you continuaIIy teII me
that I have the brain of a cucumber.

281
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:39,667
So what's Ieft? The onIy thing Ieft is that
you want your physicaI Iust satisfied.

282
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,878
And that's where I come in.

283
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:51,054
- There's onIy one thing to do.
- I know, I know...

284
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,099
- I'II undress and do my duty.
- No!

285
00:21:56,643 --> 00:22:00,480
No, you've shown me the Iight.
I've been a cad.

286
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,109
OK. I propose...

287
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:09,906
that you and I abstain
from physicaI contact for one month.

288
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:12,659
StrictIy business for one month.

289
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:17,288
I think that's the onIy way that
each of us can regain our seIf-respect.

290
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,793
I think that's a very good idea.
It wouId heIp me a Iot.

291
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,879
Fine. One month it is.

292
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:27,256
- Mr MaIone.
- Miss Chambers.

293
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,804
There is just one more thing.

294
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,765
I think... PIease, have a seat.

295
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:41,979
I think that my seIf-respect
bounces back quicker than you expect.

296
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:50,571
I think two weeks of...strictIy business,
and I'II be back in peak shape.

297
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:54,534
Maybe, if I concentrate, one week.

298
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,996
I beIieve that my recuperative powers
are even greater than yours.

299
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:02,750
A day wouId be fine with me.

300
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:07,046
The important thing is that
we both know that we couId stop.

301
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:15,221
I think that an hour
wouId certainIy prove that.

302
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:20,476
WeII, from that argument it foIIows
that 1 5 minutes wouId be adequate.

303
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:25,606
- That's enough time to get to my pIace.
- Let's hurry.

304
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,268
