1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,085
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:06,121
Woody's a
married man, huh? Yeah.

3
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:08,156
Yeah, what a lucky guy.

4
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:09,557
Indeed, he is.

5
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,593
There's nothing
like wedded bliss.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,595
Plus, he's got
that wedding ring.

7
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:16,897
Now, that is a
real babe magnet.

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,017
Please, it's an old wives' tale.

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,352
Not so.
Yeah?

10
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,653
Oh, it's been scientifically
proven that women

11
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,722
are more attracted
to married men.

12
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,559
The whole notion is ridiculous.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,127
Look, I'll...
I'll prove it to you.

14
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,146
You see those two attractive
young females over there?

15
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:32,431
I'll go over and hit on them

16
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,849
relentlessly, all the while

17
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,400
displaying my wedding ring.

18
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,570
See how long it takes them
to give me the cold shoulder.

19
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:49,830
Hi.

20
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:53,001
You two ladies
need some company?

21
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,670
Oh, sure, I'm married, but, uh,
you know, I'm not dead.

22
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:57,572
(laughing)

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,073
I figure, well, uh...

24
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,499
Lilith is here, isn't she?

25
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,135

Yeah, over here.

42
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,545
GNS Amusements.

43
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:28,546
Oh, great.

44
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:29,981
(laughing) Sign here, please.

45
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,816
Hey, fellas, listen
up, you know how

46
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,485
I've been trying to
hustle up more business

47
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,519
for the bar?

48
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,921
Well, I think this
baby's just the ticket.

49
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,240
Cheers is now the proud owner

50
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:41,008
of a blood pressure tester.

51
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,577
(laughing)

52
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,112
That's... that's
great, Sammy.

53
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,413
I think we ought to get

54
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,182
some velvet ropes outside
to handle the lines.

55
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,617
No, no, come on, will you?

56
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,319
Lighten up here,
this could be fun.

57
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:53,555
What the hell is this?

58
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,389
They sent me a slot machine.

59
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,398
Well, I lived kind of a
sheltered girlhood, but offhand,

60
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:02,196
I'd say this looks like
a Gametime model 36X

61
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,400
with remodelled sprockets,
triple-action tumblers.

62
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,901
"The Big Boy".

63
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,236
(Rebecca sighs)

64
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,972
A slot machine.
(gasps)

65
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,608
I've never played one of these,
but I've always wanted to.

66
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:14,642
Hey, hey, come on, no, don't...

67
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:16,211
don't do that, please,
it's illegal.

68
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,013
This is the last thing
this bar needs.

69
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,184
I'm gonna call and tell
them to take it back.

70
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:22,049
It's just as well, Rebecca.

71
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,453
These are the devil's
own machines.

72
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,871
They systematically rob you

73
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:29,240
of your cash and your dignity,

74
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:30,575
one nickel at a time.

75
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,043
Allow me to demonstrate.

76
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,461
Oh, hey, come on,
Frasier, don't do that.

77
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,528
No, relax, Sam.

78
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,264
This is merely for
educational purposes.

79
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:37,549
Good-bye, nickel.

80
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:38,783
(coin clanging)

81
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,421
(bell ringing, coins clanging)

82
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:44,372
(chortling)

83
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,540
Free money!

84
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,191
The doctor is hot!

85
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,309
(laughing)

86
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,412
Excuse me, sir.

87
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,096
I represent a market
research company.

88
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,147
We're doing a survey.

89
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:54,366
Oh, I'm really not interested.

90
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,567
Thanks.
Okay.

91
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,884
How about you, sir?
Okay.

92
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:58,286
We're looking for volunteers

93
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:00,288
to taste several
brands of beer.

94
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,456
Uh, excuse me, Paul,

95
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,924
we were having
a conversation here.

96
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,959
You were saying?
Uh, uh, well,

97
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,629
if you're available,
just come to this address

98
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,764
at 2:00 this afternoon.
2:00, sure.

99
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,066
Hey, listen, uh, uh,
what exactly do I do?

100
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:15,387
Well, you'll be in a room
with several other volunteers,

101
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,922
and you'll be tasting
several varieties of beer.

102
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,290
We'll pay you for your time.

103
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,010
Excuse me, sir.

104
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:24,545
This is gonna sound like
an odd question, but...

105
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:27,448
by any chance, were
you born in a manger?

106
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,159
You've been selected
to take part in this study

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,661
due to your ages
and your drinking preferences.

108
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:42,763
Norm, there seems to be a typo

109
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,932
here on your average
beer intake.

110
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,155
Wow.

111
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,539
Now, gentlemen,

112
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,508
I'd like you to each take a sip

113
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,244
from sample A and give me
your impressions.

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,547
Ray, what do you think?

115
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:01,249
Would you serve this beer
in your home?

116
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,284
Yeah, sure.

117
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,235
And Chuck?

118
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,953
Very tasty, uh...

119
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,806
Good after-taste, too.

120
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:09,907
And Norm.

121
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,408
I don't know.

122
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,010
Didn't you just drink some?

123
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,512
Yeah, but it wasn't in my mouth

124
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,113
long enough to really taste it.

125
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,867
Hold it in your mouth
a little longer.

126
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:21,703
Try savouring it for a second,

127
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,137
and then swallow it.

128
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,543
This is great.

129
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,479
Wow, does anyone else know
about this savouring thing?

130
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,469
Now try to describe the taste.

131
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,922
Ah... well,
it's kind of, um, sweet,

132
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,957
but, uh, kind of tangy, too.

133
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:44,191
You know what I mean?

134
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,326
Yeah... very
observant.

135
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:47,295
Yeah.
What about sample B?

136
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,384
It's kind of tart.

137
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,571
Actually, I thought it
was kind of sweet.

138
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:57,605
NORM:
No, no, fellas.

139
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:58,573
It's really...
it's...

140
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,241
it's more of a smoky thing.

141
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,542
Right again.
Yeah.

142
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,777
That's the new mash
that they're using.

143
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,346
You're amazing, Norm.

144
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,426
What about,
uh, sample C? Let's see.

145
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,587
Now, this one
misses for me, okay?

146
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:16,273
Mm-hmm.
It's like the carbonation is...

147
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:17,775
is fighting the flavour,

148
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,393
and the flavour is losing.

149
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,391
This is really getting
too easy for me.

150
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,398
You want to challenge
me a bit here?

151
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,334
Okay.

152
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:27,568
Let's try samples

153
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,203
D through V.

154
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:30,271
Oh, D through V.

155
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:31,322
Now, hang on a second.

156
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,108
I may need to
cleanse my palate.

157
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,942
Do you have any pizza?

158
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,520
Oh, Carla, you're not supposed

159
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,121
to be playing that-
it's illegal.

160
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:50,391
So is watering drinks.

161
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,360
Good luck to you.

162
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,531
(bell ringing, coins clanging)

163
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,582
(whooping)

164
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,033
Come to mama.

165
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,741
(sighs):
Come on, come on, come on.

166
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,076
Darn it, this machine hates me!

167
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,512
Say, uh, Rebecca, uh,
can I give it a try?

168
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,714
Go ahead, Paul.

169
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,665
It's obviously empty.

170
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,706
(bell ringing, coins clanging)

171
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,090
Hey, hey.

172
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,392
Wow.

173
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,027
Nine nickels.

174
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,697
Hey, I wonder, if those chicks
over there saw me win, huh?

175
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,748
Yeah, Paul.

176
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,489
I'm sure the lack
of that 45 cents

177
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,402
is what kept you
out of that ménage.

178
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:40,742
Come on... come on.

179
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:41,959
Be there, be there.

180
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,694
Damn!

181
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,697
What is wrong with this machine?

182
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:49,934
Frasier won, Paul won,
Carla won.

183
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,837
Maybe it just hates women.

184
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,221
Afternoon, everybody.

185
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,090
CROWD:
Norm!

186
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,308
What's the story, Norm?

187
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,226
Boy meets beer.

188
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,493
Boy drinks beer.

189
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,061
Boy gets another beer.

190
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,231
In this performance,
the role of the boy

191
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:04,928
will be played by
Norm Peterson.

192
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,168
Sammy, I want you
to pour a round

193
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,803
for the house and
put it on my tab.

194
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,004
Ooh.
Oh!

195
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,122
Oh, thank you.

196
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,207
What's the occasion there,
big guy?

197
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,608
Well, I think I got a job.

198
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,142
Hey, all right,
Normie. CLIFF:

199
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:18,328
Stand back,
I'll take care of this.

200
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,680
All right, mister, I don't know

201
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:22,350
what pod you crawled out of...

202
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,418
but you're not welcome
in our world.

203
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,656
Now, go in peace and give us
our Normie back.

204
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:30,675
Seriously, remember that beer
tasting survey group?

205
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,443
Turns out they value
my opinion so much,

206
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:34,478
they want me to try
out at the brewery.

207
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:35,679
CLIFF:
All right.

208
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:38,849
Who'd have thought I have
a knack for something?

209
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,702
Okay, now, listen up, you.

210
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,171
This is my last nickel.

211
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,040
Now, I'm not asking for a lot.

212
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,192
I-I just want you to hit,
just once.

213
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,360
Please... for me.

214
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,199
(crying)

215
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,668
Why do you hate me?

216
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,421
Becs.
What?

217
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,539
Come here.

218
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:02,673
What do you want?

219
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:06,927
(whispering):
You are acting crazy.

220
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:09,463
You're standing there
talking to a machine,

221
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:12,199
pretending like it cares
who's feeding it nickels.

222
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,135
It doesn't have anything
against you personally.

223
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:16,337
You're right.

224
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,455
Thank you.

225
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,956
And why are you whispering?

226
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,359
I don't want it to hear
me talking to you.

227
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,720
(machines humming)

228
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,055
Pardon me, uh, are you Mike?

229
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:36,724
Hey, you must be
the new guy, Norm?

230
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:38,526
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I'll be your supervisor.

231
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,577
Oh, great.

232
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,896
I was, uh, looking over
your sample comments,

233
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,030
and, uh, well,

234
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:45,232
must say they're
very impressive.

235
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,483
Thank you.
Uh, now,

236
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,969
remember, this is just a trial,

237
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,670
but I think
you're gonna do great.

238
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:50,588
Thanks, sir.

239
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,789
Uh, the job's very simple.

240
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,290
You'll drink
random samples of beer

241
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,926
off the line
and give us your opinion.

242
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,977
That's it.

you ready to see
the brewery, Norm?

246
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,367
Oh, I've been ready
for 43 years, sir.

to the master brewer

250
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,829
who will evaluate them,
and in turn, he'll...

Are you... are you
crying, Norm?

252
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,903
Nah, just got something

253
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,038
I'll get you a Kleenex.

I've been tasting beer
all morning, okay?

297
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,509
So, I'm just gonna take a
break, change my clothes

298
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,545

Can't believe

Sam, I have pulled
that handle 578 times,

307
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,581
and this machine
has given me nothing.

308
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,082
Well, may... maybe
it's broken.

309
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,383

Come on. Big money.

314
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,143
I hate to see her beating
herself up like that.

315
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,544
Yeah, I agree.

316
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,747
If there was just some way
that she could win, even once.

317
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,715
It might serve
to break her fatalism

318
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:41,552
and bolster her self-esteem.

319
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,422
Plus, maybe then I'd get a shot,
'cause I am hot, hot, hot!

320
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:49,460
Well, there must
be some way we can fix that machine

321
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,962
so you can win just one time.

322
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,097
Now you're good
at this stuff, Carla.

323
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,164
Can't you rig it?

324
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,165
Why should I?

325
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,300
Well, because

326
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,102
she'd feel better
about herself,

327
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,337
you know, maybe
even feel happy.

328
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,822
No, really. Why should I?

329
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,094
Because there's a $20 bill
in it for you.

330
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:08,429
Deal.

331
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:09,797

332
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,032

No. None of those fancy drinks
for me, Sammy.

338
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,744

Oh.

342
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:29,550
Tell you what, Sammy.

343
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:32,253
Earning a salary
does something for a guy's self-esteem.

344
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,021
For the first time in years,

345

This says Norm Peterman.

348
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,129
That's 'cause Norm Peterson

349
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,300
is still drawing
unemployment, thank you.

350
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,801

I got to meet the
president of the brewery.

355
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,574
But I tell you what- I feel

356
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,061
Yeah, that's a wonderful
feeling, isn't it? Yeah.

357
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,292
You know, I remember
the first day I decided

358
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:01,248
to go into the healing arts.

359
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:05,185
Yeah, just the thought
of helping my fellow man...

360
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,221
it gave me a sense of purpose,
a mission in life.

361
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,556
(rhythmic beeping)

362
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:10,824
Oh.

363
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,259
Oh, surprise, surprise!

364
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:14,728
Mrs. Davis.
"I had a bad childhood."

365
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:17,364
Join the club, sister!

366
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:20,918
I'm all out of nickels.
Does anybody have a nickel?

367
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,820
Hey, hey, where's that, uh,
tip jar of Carla's?

368
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,151
No.
REBECCA: Well, I would

369
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,623
pay her back.

370
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,808
Going a little bit
overboard here, aren't you?

371
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,993
After all, it's just
a silly little machine.

372
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:31,562
It's not a silly
machine, Norman.

373
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,597
It is... It is a
metaphor for life.

374
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,265
It is. Everybody gets
to pull the handle,

375
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,584
and sometimes they win,
and sometimes they lose.

376
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:40,054
But I always lose.

377
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:43,039
I pull the handle, and
I get cherry, lemon,

378
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,942
(voice breaking):
Bell!

379
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:48,813
Rebecca, has it ever occurred
to you that maybe the reason

380
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,916
you always lose is because
you think you're going to lose?

381
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,651
Oh, don't give me that crap!

382
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,419
I tried that positive
thinking stuff,

383
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,556
and I knew it wouldn't work,
and sure enough, it didn't!

384
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,591
You are over-analysing things.

385
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,460
You got to live in the moment.

386
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,194
Take life as it comes, okay?

387
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:07,164
You start thinking too much,
everything falls apart.

388
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,433
Norm, how do you not
think too much?

389
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:10,967
You're-You're getting ready

390
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:12,836
for the biggest interview
of your life!

391
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,070
Yeah.

392
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,740
If I were you,
I would be a nervous wreck.

393
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,409
You know, I had a shot
at my dream job.

394
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:20,877
Yeah?

395
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,979
And I-I did really,
really well.

396
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,848
And then it came time

397
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:28,285
for me to meet the big boss,
and I choked.

398
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,521
I went in, and-and
I complimented him,

399
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,938
and then I realized,
"Oh, God, I'm kissing up."

400
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,558
So I took back the compliment,

401
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,827
and then it looked like
I was insulting him.

402
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:41,014
So then I started telling jokes,
and they were really bad.

403
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,751
And then... And-And then,
the next thing I knew,

404
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:49,824
I was singing,
"Knick knack paddy whack" song.

405
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:52,659
And I was just singing

406
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,595
and singing at the top
of my lungs.

407
00:16:55,663 --> 00:17:00,033
And I just kept burying myself
deeper and deeper.

408
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,987
And I lost my dream job.

409
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:07,491
And when I walked out

410
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,428
of that House of Pancakes,
I felt two inches tall.

411
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,638
Well, Rebecca, that's about
the most depressing thing

412
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,740
I've ever heard in my life.

413
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,617
Hey, don't... Norm,
don't listen to me.

414
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,910
It'll just bring you down.

415
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,244
Yeah.
And you know what?

416
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,113
I've been a jinx
my entire life,

417
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:31,448
but that's me.

418
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,450
That isn't you.

419
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,185
You're gonna do great.

420
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,453
Thanks.

421
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,688
Good luck.

422
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,056
Well, thanks a lot, Rebecca.

423
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,290
And for what it's worth,

424
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,392
I don't think you're
a jinx, all right?

425
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,727
(quietly):
Thanks.

426
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,729
(laughs)

427
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,930
Ah, Norm.

428
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,799
Mr. Hoffmeyer's
on his way.

429
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,667
Uh, now remember,
this is just a formality.

430
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,803
He's heard all kinds
of good things about you,

431
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:12,306
and, well, I'm sure
that as soon as he meets you,

432
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,641
uh, you'll be a permanent part
of this brewery.

433
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:16,776
You seem a little nervous.
Are you, Norm?

434
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,095
No. No.

435
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:20,947
MIKE:
Oh, Mr. Hoffmeyer,

436
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,133
I'd like you to meet
our star taster, Norm.

437
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,367
Norm, Mr. Hoffmeyer.

438
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,845
Norm, I hear you're doing
excellent work for us.

439
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,338
Thank you very much, sir.

440
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:29,807
(sighs)

441
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,108
Nice pants.

442
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,409
(chuckles)

443
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,412
I can't believe
I just said that.

444
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,380
Look, I'm not trying
to kiss up, sir.

445
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,859
I take back what I said
about those pants, okay?

446
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,384
Not that they're
not nice pants.

447
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:42,786
I mean, of course they are.

448
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,054
They're-They're-They're
great pants, you know.

449
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,689
I just don't want you to think

450
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,925
that all I'm doing is
looking at your pants.

451
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,736
I'm also looking
at your face, sir,

452
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,229
and-and your shirt, your
tie, all of which are lovely.

453
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,982
Like a manly kind of lovely.
You know what I mean?

454
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,985
Good Lord, I'm not making
much sense, am I, sir?

455
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,820
Let me just start
all over again.

456
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:02,756
Hello. My name
is Norm Pants.

457
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:06,093
Ooh! Yay. That didn't come
out right, either, did it?

458
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,629
(laughs): I'm gonna laugh
about that one tonight, sir.

459
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,147
And I'm sure you will, too,

460
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,082
when you take those
pants off tonight.

461
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,383
Not that I'm thinking

462
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,019
about you taking
your pants off, sir!

463
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,586
Nothing could be
further from the truth!

464
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:18,421
I mean, well, now,
don't get me wrong.

465
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,691
You know, it's not like
I would be grossed out

466
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,022
if you took your pants off.

467
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,945
Go ahead, run around
naked for all I care!

468
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,665
After all, you'll do
whatever you want to do.

469
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,700
You're Mr. Hoffmeyer,
for crying out loud!

470
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,969
Oh, come on, lighten
up, will you?!

471
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,954
Why are you such a sourpuss?

472
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,789
Come on. What's
it going to take

473
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:37,891
to put a smile on
that face, huh?

474
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,211
♪ With a knick knack paddy
whack, give a dog a bone ♪

475
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,014
♪ This old man
came rolling home! ♪

476
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:49,285
Sorry about the job
there, Norm.

477
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,621
Oh, don't worry
about it, Cliff.

478
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,955
What are you going to do?

479
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,758
I had my dream job for
a week, and I lost it.

480
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,710
But you've got to look on the...
on the bright side, you know.

481
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,045
I mean, somebody could
walk up to me tomorrow,

482
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:00,547
tap me on the shoulder, say,

483
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:03,183
"Hey, we want you to sample
various types of pretzels."

484
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,002
You know?

485
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,803
Or-Or-Or pizza.

486
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:07,971
Could happen.

487
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,106
Maybe, big guy.

488
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,526
Well, I did it.
I rigged the machine.

489
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,528
The next person who pulls
that handle is going

490
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,219
to be up to their
knees in nickels.

491
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,765
All right, now,
don't you feel good?

492
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,500
I mean, doesn't it
make you feel happy

493
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,669
to know you did something
for a fellow human being?

494
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,271
Isn't that what life's
really all about?

495
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,523
You don't have my 20
bucks, do you, Sam?

496
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,408
It's been kind of
a slow week, honey. I...

497
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:31,011
Now, wai-wai-wait.

498
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:33,964
REBECCA:
Norm.

499
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,700
I just wanted to tell you

500
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,768
how sorry I am
about this afternoon.

501
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,972
Rebecca, for the hundredth
time, please relax.

502
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,240
It wasn't your fault.

503
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,441
I did it myself.

504
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:45,708
I choked under pressure.

505
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,011
Well, I felt so guilty
that I went out

506
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,113
and got us this quart
of ice cream.

507
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,347
Hmm.

508
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,783
Mmm.

509
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,371
(laughs)

510
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,140
This is what
we losers do, Norm.

511
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,494
We just drown our sorrows
in ice cream.

512
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,263
But you know what?

513
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,732
Huh?

514
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,533
At least we're not alone.

515
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,235
We have each other.

516
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,588
You're not going to
kiss me again, are you?

517
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:16,590
'Cause I still
have to drive home.

518
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,561
Oh! Hey, look at that.

519
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,229
These are nickels,
I guess, huh?

520
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,232
Say, why don't you, uh, play
the slot machine one more time?

521
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,333
Because I will lose.

522
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,867
Where have you been all week?

523
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,736
No. You know,
I feel good about this.

524
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:31,738
Why-Why-Why don't you give it
one more shot?

525
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,373
No.
Oh, come on!

526
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:35,409
What's it gonna take
for you to understand

527
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,576
that I will never win?

528
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,445
All right,
fine, fine. Come on.

529
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,280
Everybody step up while

530
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:43,100
Lady Luck thumbs her nose
at Rebecca Howe.

531
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:49,005
(bell rings)

532
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,112
I got my nickel back.

533
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,130
I thought that thing
was supposed to pay off.

534
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,432
It's been paying off all week.

535
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,566
I guess it's empty.

536
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:00,784
Oh, I'm sorry.

537
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,686
Sorry?

538
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,755
This has never happened
to me before.

539
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,594
I broke even.

540
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:13,096
I've never broken even before.

541
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,331
I'm not a loser.

542
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,767
I'm a break-evener.

543
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:20,837
Norm is a loser.

544
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,172
See him eating his ice cream?

545
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:26,076
You know what this means?

546
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:28,078
It means
that my life isn't so terrible.

547
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,147
It's... It's so-so!

548
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,632
(Rebecca laughs)

549
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,634
Isn't this great?!

550
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:35,969
Hey, guys,

551
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:38,806
did Rebecca call me a loser?

552
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,808
I'm afraid so, Norm.

553
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,176
Good. I thought she said,
"Leave me some."
