00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:06,188
POWER PLAY

2
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:10,443
Remember the day I said
you are the nuttiest, stupidest,

3
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,070
phoniest fruitcake I ever met.

4
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:16,073
- You are the most arrogant...
- Shut up!

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,451
- Shut your fat mouth.
- Make me.

6
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:23,873
Make you? I'm going to bounce you
off every waII in this office.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,959
Try it and you'II waIk funny tomorrow.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,464
Or shouId I say funnier.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,217
You know,
I aIways wanted to pop you one.

10
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:37,428
Maybe this is my Iucky day.

11
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:41,223
- You disgust me.
- Are you as turned on as I am?

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,476
- More.
- Bet me.

13
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:55,738
- It sure got quiet aII of a sudden.
- You don't think he kiIIed her?

14
00:00:55,905 --> 00:01:00,034
No. Even in death,
she wouIdn't be that quiet.

15
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:04,830
What do you think they're doing
if they're not fighting?

16
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,995
- Isn't it nice that we're not fighting?
- Yes.

17
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,674
Let's go somepIace where we can feeI
free to express what we're feeIing.

18
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:43,971
- Great. How about the couch?
- The couch.

19
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:51,854
- Who said we had to be serious?
- WiII you stop joking?

20
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:57,860
I want to go somepIace intimate,
somepIace romantic.

21
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:01,196
Yeah. OK. Romantic. Yeah.

22
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,617
My apartment?

23
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:08,037
- Your apartment?
- There I go again.

24
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:12,458
- I think that's a good idea.
- That's why I said it.

25
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:18,213
Your apartment. The pIace you spend
haIf your Iife and I've never even seen it.

26
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,883
I think you're going to Iike it.

27
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,637
I'II give you my famous guided tour.

28
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,766
Starting in the bedroom.

29
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,853
And ending in heaven.

30
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,531
- Come on.
- Sam.

31
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:47,951
- What?
- I've changed my mind.

32
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:58,253
I mean about your apartment.
You'II think I'm overIy sensitive,

33
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,673
but, Sam,
you've been with a Iot of women.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,551
I have not. There have not been many.

35
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:08,764
It gets exaggerated here.
There haven't been many.

36
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:14,937
- How many have there been?
- WeII, I don't know. Maybe four hun...

37
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:21,276
Four honeys. Maybe that's more than
my share, but it's aII behind me now.

38
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:26,698
You see, that's what I mean.
I want to be speciaI.

39
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:30,285
I want to go somepIace
you've never been with a woman.

40
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,498
AII right. OK. That's easy enough.

41
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,708
Like where?

42
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:44,591
- How about a hoteI?
- Yeah. That's great.

43
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:49,054
- One you've never been to with anyone.
- AII right.

44
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,641
That's easy.

45
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,729
Let's see. HoteIs.

46
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:00,774
There we go. No.

47
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:04,278
No.

48
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:08,615
- WeII, I'II be darned.
- Forget it.

49
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:13,537
Come on. We're being siIIy here.
Why don't we go to your pIace?

50
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:19,543
- WeII, I guess that couId be aII right.
- Great.

51
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,088
Wait. Sam, it's so fiIthy.

52
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:27,009
It doesn't have to be
if we care about each other.

53
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,515
What?

54
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:39,646
No. I mean my apartment.
I haven't straightened it up for days.

55
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:45,277
I don't care. As Iong as we're together,
it doesn't matter where we are.

56
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:49,323
Sam, that's beautifuI.

57
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:52,576
We're not taIking pigsty here, are we?

58
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:57,539
- No, of course not.
- AII right, then. Come on.

59
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:00,208
- OK.
- Boy!

60
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:07,215
She'd better be great.

61
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:15,140
I know you must be curious about
what Sam and I were taIking about.

62
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:18,518
We want to be totaIIy honest with you.

63
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:28,153
It is said that fooIs rush in
where wise men fear to tread.

64
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,323
But the heart has a wisdom of its own

65
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,828
and Sam and I have decided to traverse
the faII Iine of our aIoneness.

66
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,337
- What's she taIking about?
- I don't know.

67
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:50,175
- Is this what we were taIking about?
- Of course.

68
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:54,221
We decided
we're going to start messing around.

69
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:59,851
- That's good. Great.
- So we'II see you aII Iater.

70
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:07,067
Wait. I feeI damned by faint praise.
What's wrong?

71
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:10,278
- What do you mean?
- Nothing's wrong.

72
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:15,784
You don't seem very happy
about our announcement.

73
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,413
You know, Diane, it's just kind of sudden.

74
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:25,043
- It's just happening kind of fast.
- We wish you aII the Iuck in the worId.

75
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,254
It won't be enough.

76
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:36,346
I know you're thinking we have
different backgrounds and dreams.

77
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:41,560
WeII, Iet me teII you, we have one thing
very much in common...

78
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:44,771
I got it. They were both born brunette.

79
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:53,905
We are wiIIing to be vuInerabIe
to one another.

80
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:58,160
I see a trip to ye oId Ieash
and Ieather shop coming up.

81
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:09,588
I am sorry that you're aII so cynicaI
that you can't accept Sam and me.

82
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,841
It doesn't bother us.
We beIieve in us, right?

83
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:20,056
You bet. It'II be great. I may have to work
harder on this one, but it'II be worth it.

84
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,185
- Thank you, Sam.
- You're weIcome.

85
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:30,150
Now, if you wiII excuse us, we are going
to go out and begin our Iives together.

86
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:36,239
There's more to heaven and earth
than is dreamt of in your beer mugs.

87
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:41,161
- What do you mean work a IittIe harder?
- I didn't mean anything.

88
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,456
I think they might have misunderstood.

89
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:59,930
Thanks for picking the fIowers
for me in the park.

90
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:02,933
Thank you for paying the fine.

91
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:08,271
We make a good team.
So what do you think of my pIace?

92
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,608
Very nice. Is this the bedroom?

93
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:17,530
Nice? I want you to know that I'm putting
a Iot of energy into the decorating.

94
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:21,451
- It shows. Where's the Iight?
- Over by the bed.

95
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:27,123
I think I stepped on your cat.
My God, I think I kiIIed it.

96
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:33,797
- My mistake. I stepped on your giraffe.
- Mr Jammers.

97
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,678
This pIace is Iousy with stuffed animaIs.

98
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:45,684
They're not stuffed animaIs. They're
friends. Mr Jammers you've met.

99
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,106
- Over here is Freddy Frogbottom.
- You named aII these siIIy things?

100
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:54,984
Don't caII them siIIy.
Mr Buzzer wiII sting you.

101
00:09:56,111 --> 00:10:00,448
Mr Buzzer? Let me guess.
That must be the bee, right?

102
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:03,159
This is definiteIy weird.

103
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,876
- That is exactIy what's wrong with you.
- What's wrong with me?

104
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:17,382
You don't have any imagination
about this.

105
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,804
No sense of whimsy.
You're so earthbound. So uninspired.

106
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,223
I can't beIieve
you're making such a big deaI.

107
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,728
Sam MaIone, those animaIs
happen to be a part of me.

108
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:34,607
Why can't you induIge that...
What are you doing?

109
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:38,570
- I'm taking my pants off.
- Why?

110
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,906
WeII, not to give Mr Buzzer a target.

111
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:48,413
We're arguing. How couId you take
your pants off in a fight?

112
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,710
It won't Iast aII night. I don't want
to be overdressed when it ends.

113
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:56,921
- Get out of here.
- You want me to Ieave?

114
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:01,050
- I demand that you Ieave.
- Let me teII you a ruIe I have.

115
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:06,181
Mr MaIone doesn't put his pants
on again untiI he finishes business.

116
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:09,851
- Bet me.
- Diane, wouId you pIease...

117
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:13,813
WouId you give me a break
and Iet me put my...

118
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,065
You are despicabIe.

119
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:20,195
I never want to see
your fat, ugIy face again. Get out.

120
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:23,740
Come on.
I'm Iosing the mood here, Diane.

121
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:33,124
- You'II Iose a Iot more than that.
- Wait. Do you want to know the truth?

122
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,419
It wasn't four women.
It was 400 women, easy.

123
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,838
They'd have to be.

124
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:55,770
Most of the guys I broke
into the majors with are aII gone now.

125
00:11:55,937 --> 00:12:00,400
- You mean gone to the great beyond?
- No, AIan, dead.

126
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:08,574
I can't understand it. You wonder,
you're born, you grow up, you die.

127
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,369
Is that the end? Is that it?

128
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:15,832
There's various theories
about an afterIife, Coach.

129
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:19,293
MiIIions beIieve in reincarnation.

130
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,672
You mean
when you come back as a chicken?

131
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,008
Not necessariIy as a chicken.

132
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:31,431
Hindus beIieve what you come back as
depends on your behaviour.

133
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:35,184
Lead a good Iife to come back
in an eIevated state.

134
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,395
Like CoIorado?

135
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,442
No, Coach. More Iike a king or a prince.

136
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:48,990
If you've not Ied a good Iife,
you'II come back in a IowIy condition.

137
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:53,744
Last time out, I must have made
a reaI ass out of myseIf.

138
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,790
I figure if you're dead, you're dead.

139
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:01,586
This idea of Iiving forever
doesn't appeaI.

140
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:03,838
I can see why, PauI.

141
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:10,261
Hey, Sam.

142
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:14,515
- What do you think about death?
- Too good for her.

143
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,935
I don't want to taIk to anyone.
I mean it.

144
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,773
- I knew it.
- We toId them so.

145
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,651
- They wouIdn't Iisten.
- Forget it.

146
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:28,613
Something's wrong
with Sam and Diane.

147
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,700
- We're taIking about Sam and Diane.
- You are? That's better.

148
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:37,955
- It's none of our business.
- We ought to do something about it.

149
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:43,127
- Everybody deserves a chance.
- I think we owe Sam an apoIogy.

150
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:48,007
- I'm going to chat to Sammy.
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.

151
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:52,178
He didn't mean me.
Sammy and I are paIs. We're tight.

152
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:58,726
- Sammy? Norm.
- Get the heII out of here!

153
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:03,564
- You bet, buddy.
- That was inspiring, Norm.

154
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,901
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.

155
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,695
We're sorry about what we said.

156
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:12,782
You're no worse a match
than anybody eIse.

157
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:18,788
- Any two peopIe wiII be a Iong shot.
- Right. Long shots come in some time.

158
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:23,709
No. You guys were right.
I must have Iost my mind for a minute.

159
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:28,130
The oId Sam MaIone is back, boys.
Ready for action.

160
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:33,719
I'm going to grab the first woman
that comes by and I'm going to go crazy.

161
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:38,265
Yeah, CarIa, what is it?

162
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:41,769
Nothing.

163
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:45,481
It feeIs good to be finaIIy rid of her.

164
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:50,861
Let me have a soda. Things are going
to be more the way they used to be.

165
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:54,740
GIad to hear you say that.
You'II be a better man.

166
00:14:54,907 --> 00:15:00,204
- Coach, are you buying this?
- Buying it? I'm not even foIIowing it.

167
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:07,461
- CarIa, I mean it.
- I beIieve you, Sammy. I do.

168
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:10,256
I couId teII you how to get Diane back.

169
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:17,930
TeII you what. If you're interested,
I'II be down at the end of the bar.

170
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,778
WeII, it's got to be good for a Iaugh.

171
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:42,538
How?

172
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:47,710
Women have aIways come easy to you.
Now you have got a toughie.

173
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:53,549
Let me teII you how to handIe her.
Now, I don't care what we women say

174
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:58,095
when we get dressed up
and go on the PhiI Donahue show.

175
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,435
Every woman wants to be controIIed.
Even your Miss Egghead there.

176
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:09,106
Women Iike power, Sammy.
Raw, naked power.

177
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:12,985
I stayed with Nick so Iong
because he had power.

178
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,321
He was a gentIeman sometimes.

179
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:22,119
He wouId take me out to a romantic
dinner at a fancy restaurant.

180
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:25,581
They'd caII our number and he'd go get it.

181
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:34,048
But once we got into the bedroom,
he caIIed the shots.

182
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:39,637
She's right. One time I had to get tough
with Vera. ReaIIy Iay down the Iaw.

183
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:44,183
Next night I came home,
she was wearing a saran wrap bikini.

184
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,523
I haven't been abIe
to Iook at a sandwich since.

185
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:57,738
You know, you're right.

186
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:02,910
I have Iet her have her way
every step in this reIationship.

187
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:07,039
She's Ieading me around by the nose.
Not any more.

188
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:11,335
She has picked the wrong guy
to have a power pIay with.

189
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:17,841
I'm going to go over and teII her there's
a time to put up and a time to shut up.

190
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,845
It's time for her to put up and shut up.

191
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:25,266
- She'II have him for breakfast.
- He's a goner.

192
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,476
Dead in the water.

193
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:33,732
Where did you get that tan?
Were you in the sun?

194
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,236
What are you taIking about?
Look at your tan.

195
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,489
I couIdn't Iive
where there was no sun.

196
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,825
How can prisoners stand it?

197
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:47,246
- Diane, open up.
- Go away, Sam.

198
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,583
- I'm meditating.
- Open the door, Diane.

199
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,670
I have something I want to say.

200
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:03,929
Sam, we were not made in heaven.

201
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:07,266
We turn into idiots
in each other's company.

202
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:12,521
The difference in your case is bareIy
perceptibIe, but it's bothering me.

203
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,774
Open up. It's the Iast time I'II teII you.

204
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:21,447
- Who the heII do you think you are?
- That was your Iast warning.

205
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:25,784
What are you doing? Sam, stop it.

206
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:36,045
Now you've done it. You broke my door.
You'II pay for that, ape.

207
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:40,799
Ape? I Iike that. Yeah, I Iike that. Ape.

208
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:44,261
You are going to pay for a Iot of things.

209
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:55,439
Get in that bedroom, woman.

210
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,323
Okay.

211
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:14,750
WouId you give me a minute
to sIip into something fIimsy?

212
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,960
Yeah. Sure.

213
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:40,317
- Are you taIking to somebody?
- I'm on the phone. Just a second.

214
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:47,658
You're making a teIephone caII?
Who did you caII?

215
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:52,079
The poIice. WouId you Iike some coffee
whiIe we wait?

216
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,168
You caIIed the poIice? Why?

217
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,715
Act Iike a marauding Hun and you'II be
treated Iike one. You take cream?

218
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:07,052
Yeah, but, no. Wait.

219
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:11,473
Wait a minute. Are you serious?
You caIIed the cops on me?

220
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,684
I'm serious.

221
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,647
I've got fresh ground, but it'II take time.
They'II be right over.

222
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:23,694
Come on. Wait a second.
I'm not doing anything here.

223
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,156
You broke into my apartment.
I have the evidence.

224
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:33,912
You know, you're a Ioon.
That's what you are.

225
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,874
- I'm getting the heII out of here.
- You have to run?

226
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:43,797
I'II caII the poIice
and give them your address.

227
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:47,676
You make me so mad.
I'd Iike to take your face and...

228
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:53,974
Excuse me. Be carefuI what you say.
It couId be used against you in court.

229
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,937
What's the finaI verdict on the coffee?

230
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,861
What are you doing to me?
I'm Iosing my mind here.

231
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:12,284
I thought you couId be the woman
to make me happy for the rest of my Iife.

232
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:15,704
Now I'd be happy just to stay out of jaiI.

233
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,000
You make me sorry I was ever born.

234
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:24,963
Sam, I know how you feeI.

235
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:29,801
Don't Iet them take me away.

236
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:37,142
Sam, the important thing here is that
we've both Iearned something tonight.

237
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:43,440
You've Iearned that vioIence
has no pIace in a romantic reIationship.

238
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,650
No pIace at aII.

239
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:51,573
- And I've discovered something, too.
- What?

240
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,285
I Iike the Iift part.

241
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,584
I Iike it a Iot.

242
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,853
You know,
you've made my Iife a Iiving heII.

243
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,483
I didn't want you to think it was easy.

244
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:36,493
Let me just kick these things
off the bed here.

245
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,703
Put them in the other room.

246
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,666
I'II be Iess inhibited
if they're in the other room.

247
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:47,504
Be very carefuI, because some of them
are oId and sensitive.

248
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:56,221
- ShouIdn't you caII the cops off?
- SiIIy Sam. I never caIIed the poIice.

249
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:16,950
Sam, keep Gary GoriIIa and Mr Jammers
apart. They don't get aIong.

250
00:23:18,034 --> 00:23:20,912
Not to worry. They're a miIe apart.

251
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,075
