1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,357
Yes, I'll tell him.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,038
Sam, I just had a conversation
with your date tonight.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,513
Bambi.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,638
She said she can't make it.
She's had an accident.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,478
You're kidding. What happened?

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,790
She fell off her shoes.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,515
Gee, that's tough.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,552
That leaves me only two hours
to find another date.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,119
- Those are the breaks.
- Not to worry.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,309
The book!

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,512
Cliff, I swear,
it just gave off a beam of light.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,758
- A little black book?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,111
Didn't those go out with getting
a girl drunk and seducing her?

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,673
That's out now?

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
Let me see.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,319
Christie Leveroni.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,908
Christie Leveroni, come on down!

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,070
Come on, Sam, let me dial this one.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,715
It's been a long time since I've run
my fingers over a girl's digits.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,795
Norman.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,435
You know, I haven't seen Christie
since Woodstock.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,279
- You were at Woodstock?
- A friend told me to go there.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,630
Said it was a great place
to pick up chicks.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,320
I should have known
you weren't there for the music.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,271
There was music at Woodstock?

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,236
Sammy, it's ringing.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,075
Hello. Is Christie there?

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,278
She entered a convent?

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,632
Boys, it looks like
your idol has fallen.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,990
So what's the number over there?

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,471
- Hi, Coach.
- Hi, Diane.

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,158
Hey, Coach.

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,514
Sam. Look at me.

34
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,631
- Do I look OK to you?
- Yeah, why?

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,149
I just went
to renew my driver's licence.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,077
They asked me
to donate my kidneys.

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,955
No, don't take that personal, Coach.
They ask everybody.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,470
Those highway robbers.
It used to be a lousy two bucks.

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,518
- Carla's late again.
- Yeah, I know. I wonder why.

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,472
Sam, you know why.

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,717
Why aren't any of us saying anything
about Carla's problem?

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,479
I don't think we should be
the ones to bring this up.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,079
You know Carla, she's proud.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,476
Maybe she just wants to keep
this one under her hat, that's all.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,195
Maybe it's not even
what we think it is.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,395
- Coach, what else could it be?
- Gas?

47
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,394
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, Carla.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,309
- I got to go change.
- OK.

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,118
What are we all so afraid of?

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,550
We've known for well over a month
that Carla's...

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,831
Let me be the first to say it aloud.
Carla is pregnant.

52
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,439
That's it, Sam, it's out.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
Sam, she is all alone in the world.
She needs some support.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,717
She's probably waiting
for us to reach out.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,435
- You people call yourselves friends.
- Why don't you talk to her?

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,229
Well, I would, but Carla's
never actually called me a friend,

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,158
unless "doofus"
is a term of endearment.

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,835
No, don't look at me.
Vera and I don't have any kids.

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,076
I don't know anything
about the subject.

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,316
How come you and Vera
never had any kids?

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,554
- I can't, Coach.
- Gee, I'm sorry, Norm.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,716
I look at Vera... I just can't.

63
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,710
- So how's it going, guys?
- Hi, Carla.

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,909
This is...

65
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,553
Look, Carla,
we just want you to know that...

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,514
Well, if there's anything
you ever need, just ask us, OK?

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,473
Well, since you
brought it up, Sam.

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,397
Yeah, what?

69
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,308
I'm going to need a couple
of hours off at the end of April.

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,237
If you don't want to talk about it...

71
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,272
No, it's OK. I told the father
about it yesterday.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,358
He's been out of town.
I just wanted to tell him first.

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,392
Tell the rest of them.
I mean, they're dying to hear.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,670
- I'll go talk to them.
- Alright.

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,158
What was I saying?
The weather is really...

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,352
It's always just...
sort of beautiful.

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,469
Everyone?

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,593
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,477
No! You're pregnant? Carla.
Well, why didn't you say anything?

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,513
I've got a lot on my mind.
I can't remember everything.

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,119
Sure. Busy girl.

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,471
Congratulations.
Unless you don't want another kid.

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,910
- Of course she wanted the kid.
- Sure I do.

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,998
What penniless, unmarried
mother of four wouldn't?

85
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,439
See what I mean?

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,870
Don't worry about that. I'll give you
a little bump-up in pay.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,592
- Thanks, Sam.
- That's great.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,716
Carla gets a raise
for getting pregnant.

89
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,593
I wonder what I have to do
to get a raise out of the boss.

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,837
You could get a raise
out of the boss.

91
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,918
So who's the father?
We want to know.

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,874
You're about to see for yourselves.
He's coming in.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,753
I really got lucky this time, boy.

94
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,078
He's a nice, responsible guy,
and he is going to support this kid.

95
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,112
That's great.
You going to get married?

96
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,232
Well, you know, actually
we probably would, Sam,

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,591
except it goes against
my most cherished belief.

98
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,314
Men are toe jam.

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,709
Who is this guy?

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,559
Marshall.

101
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,753
- Marshall?
- Carla made love to a PhD from MlT?

102
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,555
Look, guys, if you can't say it
in front of me, don't say it at all.

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,433
No, Coach.

104
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,155
Coach, Marshall is the father
of Carla's child.

105
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,875
Marshall? I don't believe it,
and I believe everything.

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,557
- How are you feeling, little mommy?
- I'll make a deal with you.

107
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,432
You don't call me "little mommy",

108
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,790
and I don't put your tongue
in the blender.

109
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,678
- Come down and sit down here.
- Come on, Marshall.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,189
- Way to go.
- I'm so happy for you both.

111
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,279
- Congratulations, Marshall.
- Congratulations, Dad.

112
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,233
Why don't you have a seat,
little... Carla?

113
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,315
Thank you.

114
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,318
We have something to celebrate.
A little champagne.

115
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,556
- A toast!
- Serve it up, boys.

116
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,033
I'll get the glasses.

117
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,311
By the way,
I recommend the Lamaze method.

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,829
I've read about that
and it sounds wonderful.

119
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,030
No, forget it.
I got my own method.

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,197
Knock me out and wake me
when it's potty-trained.

121
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,874
Let's make a toast.
Somebody make a toast.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,309
- Diane, make the toast.
- Alright.

123
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,033
To the baby.

124
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,312
With Marshall as the father,
it's sure to have brains.

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,637
With Carla as the mother,
it's sure to have need for them.

126
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,591
I'm kidding. What I mean is,

127
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,871
to the baby and its luck
at having such wonderful parents.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,399
Hear, hear.

129
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,789
What, what?

130
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,515
I think I'd better just lie down
for a minute, alright?

131
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,234
Would you all excuse me?
I'll be right back.

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,033
I didn't even know
you and Carla were dating.

133
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,914
Actually, Coach,
we just dated the one time.

134
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,873
One time?

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,639
Just once?

136
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,313
It's a funny thing, too,

137
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,274
because Carla wouldn't
give me a second look before that.

138
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,913
Or since.

139
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,877
But she sure was ready, willing
and able that night.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,752
She was a woman possessed.

141
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,599
So the whole thing was her idea?

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,676
Yes, I think you could say that.

143
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,836
Not that I didn't enjoy myself,

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,396
but I had no idea
this would be the result.

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,593
I was so surprised
when she told me about it yesterday.

146
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,950
Would you excuse me, Marshall?
I think I need to talk to Carla.

147
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,075
- You clever girl, you.
- What?

148
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,875
I know what you're up to,
you sly boots.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
Got to hand it to you, pretty smart.

150
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,989
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,635
Marshall's not the father
of that child.

152
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,038
Maybe he is and maybe he isn't.

153
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,716
Come on, Carla. You can tell me.

154
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,673
I'm proud of you.
This shows real initiative.

155
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,677
Well, since you already guessed,
you're right, he's not the father.

156
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,233
I lied so he'd support it.

157
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,795
What a great, great plan.

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,195
Yeah, well, I hate
to sing my own praises.

159
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,311
Well, don't sing your own praises.

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,670
Why don't you hum
a few bars of this tune?

161
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,193
<i>Carla, how could you?</i>

162
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,993
Why don't you sit down
and let me talk for a change?

163
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,348
Fine.

164
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,511
I'd had a really rotten day.

165
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,117
I got stiffed twice.

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,676
Sam bawled me out for something.
You were here.

167
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,109
I got soaked on the way home.

168
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,879
By the time I got the kids
locked in their rooms,

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,070
I had really had it.

170
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,836
So I sat down at the kitchen table,
a bottle of Chianti.

171
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,716
I just started thinking
about how rotten my whole life was...

172
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,713
...when I saw his face
through the fog in the door window.

173
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,190
- Who?
- Nick, my ex-husband.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,990
Besides everything else,
it was our anniversary.

175
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,519
I see.

176
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,155
But I was so down, I figured we could
just talk for a while, you know?

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,271
So we were drinking

178
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,393
and remembering
the couple of good times we had.

179
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,750
It was the first laugh
I had all day.

180
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,868
He was wearing
his black fishnet T-shirt.

181
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,073
I could see his panther tattoo
through the little holes.

182
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,114
No woman could resist.

183
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,193
With the rain and everything
and the wine,

184
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,231
I just got carried away.

185
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,434
Carla, this is the man
you once referred to as "seepage".

186
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,437
Sure, Nick's disgusting,

187
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,438
but he knows this spot
on your earlobe.

188
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,712
One nibble and you are
a heaving mound of flesh.

189
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,957
I find that very hard to believe.

190
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,513
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

191
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,110
- Well, let me just show you.
- Carla, don't be ridiculous.

192
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,514
Carla.

193
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,433
Cliff, no, this isn't
what you think it is.

194
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,155
No, it's OK.
I'm an '80s kind of a guy.

195
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,511
- Seen all the right movies.
- Yes. Well, no.

196
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,631
Cliff, you see, Carla and I

197
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,594
were testing a fascinating
scientific hypothesis.

198
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,789
Scientific.

199
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,357
I like science.

200
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,752
Step right this way.
Carla, show him.

201
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,391
- Unbelievable.
- I didn't feel anything.

202
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,557
Well, sometimes
there's a delayed reaction.

203
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,275
- Maybe if both of you jumped on...
- Take a walk.

204
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,917
Listen, if you need a <i>trois</i>
for that <i>ménage</i>, I'll be in the bar.

205
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,835
Alright, let me see if
I have the decadence straight.

206
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,793
When you discovered
you were pregnant,

207
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,354
you purposely seduced Marshall

208
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,596
because you assumed
that your husband

209
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,395
would not assume responsibility
for the child.

210
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,557
- Exactly.
- Depraved.

211
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,828
Now, look here, Whitey.

212
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,554
You know, you can talk,
but I got four kids,

213
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,752
and I've been raising them alone
and it's been damned hard.

214
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,269
I can't take it any more.

215
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,029
Somebody is going to help me
ease my load a little bit this time,

216
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,355
and I don't care
what I have to do to get it.

217
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,040
Carla, it's wrong.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,675
I don't care.
And I don't care what you think.

219
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,394
- What did you guys do to Cliff?
- What's the matter?

220
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,193
We just had to pull him
off the wooden lndian.

221
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,236
- Cliff.
- Yes?

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,389
Yeah, Cliff. Sip. Beer. Sip, Cliff.

223
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,195
Carla, do you know the story
of <i>The Tell</i>-<i>Tale Heart?</i>

224
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,357
- Take a leap, Whitey.
- I'm going to tell it to you.

225
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,869
A young man killed an old man.

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,638
While carrying out the crime,

227
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,198
he could hear his victim's
heart beating in fright. Ba-boom.

228
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,509
He was very glad
when the man was dead

229
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,471
and the awful sound stopped.

230
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,559
Then he dismembered his victim
and buried him under the floorboards.

231
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,549
Soon, he could hear a sound
coming up from the floor.

232
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,074
Till he couldn't stand it any more.
Surely everyone heard it.

233
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,112
Eventually,
guilt drove him totally insane.

234
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,435
You can never escape
your conscience.

235
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,191
OK! Tom, I've been cheating on you.

236
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,835
You are a wonderful man
and I don't deserve you.

237
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,394
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, darling.

238
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,999
- ls this having any effect on you?
- None at all.

239
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,554
Maybe you need bigger ba-booms.

240
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,955
Diane, would you just
leave me alone?

241
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,833
Carla, don't get upset.
Sit down with me.

242
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,270
Thanks. So, how's it going, Dad?

243
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,030
Great, I think I'm approaching
a state of euphoria.

244
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,598
- Coach, could I have that beer?
- Absolutely, Marshall.

245
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,998
Carla, what do you think
we should name the child?

246
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,556
We got time for names, Marshall.

247
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,989
The biggest argument
I ever had with my wife

248
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,917
was over naming our daughter.

249
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,349
She kept insisting on Lisa.

250
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,675
I wanted to stick
with the original name.

251
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,190
- What was that, Coach?
- Baby Girl Pantusso.

252
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,914
You know, Carla,
I've been thinking.

253
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,996
Tomorrow, I'm going
to go to my lawyer,

254
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,350
and have a new will drawn up

255
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,315
and all of your children will
be named as my beneficiaries.

256
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,275
Gee, Marshall,
I never expected that.

257
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,192
That's about the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done...

258
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,995
Diane, would you just cut it out
with the stupid "ba-booms"?

259
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,556
Carla, Diane's in the back room.

260
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,431
Come on, we got to talk.

261
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,516
You win. I'm going
to tell him the truth.

262
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,428
Will somebody please tell me
what's going on here?

263
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,075
- She's going to tell him the truth.
- The truth about what?

264
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,552
Sam, it's terrible. She lied.
The real father is her ex-husband.

265
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,474
I don't believe this.
I mean, I know the guy.

266
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,116
Her ex-husband is an insensitive,
macho pig with one thing on his mind.

267
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,077
- Some women are attracted to that.
- Name one.

268
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,032
Arlene Abrams.

269
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,317
Angela Adams.

270
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,591
- I'm going home.
- No, listen. Wait a minute.

271
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,152
I'm going to talk to you first.

272
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,554
Sit down. Now, look.

273
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,309
Diane told me what's going on
and I just have to say something.

274
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,510
Marshall, you and Carla have a chance
for some great happiness here.

275
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,596
I don't think
you should throw it away.

276
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,393
- Sam, you don't...
- Come on, let me say this.

277
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,833
- Look at me, Marshall.
- Look at you?

278
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,399
Yeah. Now, a lot of people
think that I've got a great life.

279
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,718
But you have a... You can have
something that I don't have.

280
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,912
You can have the love
and the warmth of a family.

281
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,158
You know, if you don't marry Carla,
some lucky guy's going to.

282
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,238
As a matter of fact, if you
don't marry Carla, I'm going to.

283
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,877
I'm not going to marry her.

284
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,719
- I got the veil in my locker.
- You understand that what...

285
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,349
Get out of here. You're all toe jam.

286
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,628
You know,
I just feel terrible about this.

287
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,354
I guess she really did
want some help with this child.

288
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,756
Yeah, she's barely getting by
just the way it is.

289
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,519
Carla's probably never felt lonelier
than she does at this moment.

290
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,477
Got any more of those
little yellow goldfish crackers?

291
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,717
We don't have any crackers
that look like goldfish.

292
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,710
What did I just eat?

293
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,229
I wish I had the money so I could
take care of the kid myself.

294
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,271
Me, too, Sam.

295
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,234
Wait, I've got a wonderful idea.
We are always taking up collections

296
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,999
for little league teams
and to give gifts to orphans.

297
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,839
We are now going to take up
a collection to help Carla.

298
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
I think Cheers
should adopt this child.

299
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,155
You know,
that's not such a stupid idea.

300
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,113
We could all take turns
doing things with the kid.

301
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,196
- Right.
- I could teach him how to pitch.

302
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,471
I could teach him how to hit
your pitches out of the ballpark.

303
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,636
I'll do the kid's taxes.

304
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,392
Coach, come here.

305
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,751
Listen, everybody.
This is for Carla's kid.

306
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,199
It's going to be our kid.

307
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,595
I can teach it
how to slide into second base.

308
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,711
You can't. Remember your back.

309
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,276
- I can teach him how to swim.
- You're afraid of the water.

310
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,073
Well, I can teach him
how to tie a Windsor knot.

311
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,997
Why do you think you wear clip-ons?

312
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,872
Well, I can just sit there.

313
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,079
I'm going home.

314
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,432
Carla, before you do,
we want you to take this from us.

315
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,790
It's to help out with the kid.

316
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,276
We'd kind of like it
to be our kid, too.

317
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,078
<i>When you walk through a storm</i>

318
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,519
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

319
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,553
<i>And don't be afraid of the dark</i>

320
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,954
Everybody, come on.

321
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:40,589
<i>At the end of a storm</i>
<i>is a golden light</i>

322
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,512
<i>And the sweet silver song of a lark</i>

323
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,676
<i>Walk on through the wind</i>

324
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,870
<i>Walk on through the rain</i>

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,918
<i>Though your dreams</i>
<i>be tossed and blown</i>

326
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,431
<i>Walk on, walk on</i>

327
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,394
<i>With hope in your heart</i>

328
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:20,473
<i>And you'll never walk alone</i>

329
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,673
<i>You'll never walk alone</i>
