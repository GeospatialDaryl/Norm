Yeah. Nothing says class

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:21,068

    floating in your beer, huh?

7

Oh, come on, norm.          
    It's, uh, yuppie nouveau

 floating in your beer.

         old-fashioned, cliff,

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,578
but the only thing      
        i like floatin' in beer

11

is my liver.

12
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,335
You know,                  
     it's quite remarkable.

13
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,437
To float somethin' as heavy    
 as a wedge of lime,

14
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:42,940
beer must have, uh,            
 quite a high buoyancy factor.

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,476
So do your loafers.

16
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,349
You think, uh, an olive        
 could float in beer?

17
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,185
Yeah, only one way      
        to find out, my friend.

18
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,872
Well, guess it doesn't.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,041
But, you know, i think 
         maybe an orange rind,

20
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,509
being of           
             the citrus family,

21
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,077
and a close cousin 
             of the lime,

22
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:05,179
just might float.

23
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:08,816

 has been proven correct,

 if a lit match                 
 would float in beer.

Don't you use              
     the word "bed" with me.

148
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,411
I forbid you to use        
     the word "bed."

149
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,281
Sorry.

150
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:48,950
You make me sick.

151
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,359
Last time i buy aftershave     
 at a gas station.

152
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:01,145
[Door shuts]

153
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,530
carla, come here.

154
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,633
Does this              
         make you sick?

155
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,135
Yeah.

156
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:10,354
But only 'cause you waited     
 till after i was married       
 to do it.

157
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,991
Does my aftershave 
             make you sick?

158
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,727
Oh. Yeah.

159
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,463
W-well, somebody should     
    have said something.

160
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,418
Frasier, don't use         
     your gold card.

161
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:28,256
I exceeded the limit       
     this morning buying        
     biodegradable diapers.

162
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:29,740
They're not cheap,         
     they're not pretty,

163
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,059
but they'll disintegrate    
    within 50 years.

164
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,511
She loves her earth.

165
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:38,383
And look at these              
 marvelous toys i bought today.

166
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,518
Oh, our child      
             will love these.

167
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,686
I'm sure he can't  
             wait to be born.

168
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:45,623
Monochromatic, 
                 high contrast.

169
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,392
What,                   
        they run out of colors?

170
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,528
Oh, no, woody, you see, 
        tests have proven

171
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,664
that simple black and white 
    geometric designs

172
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:56,116
stimulate the young infant's   
 mind to a remarkable degree.

173
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:58,202
Oh, i don't know,  
             i was raised on    
             pink and blue,

174
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,054
and look           
             how i turned out.

175
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,124
In your face, doc.

176
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,560
The evidence at hand           
 notwithstanding,

177
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,696
current child development      
 experts agree

178
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,831
that infants respond           
 with great excitement

179
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,499
to toys like these.            
                    Mmm-hmm.

180
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,501
Whoo, yeah. They say,

181
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,371
"whoo, this stuff              
 cost a fortune.                
 My parents must be rich."

182
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,794
Well, come, lilith. 
            We're off to lunch.

183
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,762
Besides, the boys here 
         have to get back to

184
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,798
that mind-expanding    
         and all-important,

185
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,801
tastes great-less filling  
     debate.

186
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,652
Yeah, so where--where          
 did we end up?

187
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,587
Well, i think it was,  
         uh, tastes great.

188
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,289
No, it was less filling.

189
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:36,540
No, tastes great.

190
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,726
Less filling.                  
                 Tastes great.

191
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,811
Oh, frasier, lilith,       
     excuse me.

192
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,813
I know you're probably 
         on your way somewhere,

193
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,015
yes, we are.                   
     But when aren't we?

194
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,685
It's just that i just have 
     this really bad problem.

195
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,187
It's getting so bad that       
 i can't even sleep at night.

196
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,773
Well, i'm sorry, rebecca.  
     We do have                 
     this important lunch.

197
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,276
You see, i've been having  
     these erotic dreams.

198
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,778
Well, lunch be damned.      
    Our friend is in need.

199
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:02,349
What about                 
     russell and pam?

200
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,202
Oh, hang russell and pam.

201
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,921
They just want to weasel some  
 free psychological advice      
 out of us anyway.

202
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:11,175
So, rebecca,                   
 go on about your dreams.

203
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,644
Well, i guess you could say    
 that the main problem

204
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,312
is that this guy,          
     who's...

205
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,848
oh, i don't know, i guess      
 you could say he's starring

206
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,449
in these dreams,

207
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:22,787
is somebody that i definitely  
 should not be dreaming about.

208
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,221
Ah.

209
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,007
Because even though he's a     
 sexy and successful doctor,

210
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:30,495
he's also happily married      
 and about to be a father.

211
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:36,150
There is no fruit so sweet     
 as that which is forbidden.

212
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:39,070
Frasier, stop before you    
    embarrass yourself further.

213
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,204
What?

214
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,755
Darling,                    
    you're the love of my life,

215
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,825
but even i don't have      
     erotic dreams about you.

216
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:50,030
So who is it? Mel gibson?  
     Harrison ford?

217
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:52,483
That young man with        
     the wavy brown hair        
     and the leg muscles,

218
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,652
who comes in here              
 all sweated up after bowling,

219
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,904
and has nodded hello       
     to me twice?

220
00:10:58,273 --> 00:10:59,573
It's sam.

221
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,309
Sam malone?

222
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:04,178
Can you believe it?

223
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:05,779
(Rebecca)                  
     he is the last person

224
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,514
i would want               
     to see in my dreams.

225
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:10,184
I mean, i play                 
 donald trump's board game,

226
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,852
i watch ted turner's network,

227
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,555
i just finished                
 robin colcord's new book,

228
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,573
and somehow, in my dreams,

229
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:19,943
i end up dancing on my back 
    with sam malone.

230
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,998
Perhaps, sam represents     
    someone else,

231
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:27,118
someone you fear craving    
    even more.

232
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,003
Frasier, it's not you.     
     Get over it.

233
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:34,458
Take a joke.

234
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,044
Just please tell me            
 that it's not sam malone       
 in my dreams,

235
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:40,664
so i don't have to take a bath 
 with my electric toaster.

236
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,550
Well, rebecca,          
        there are those         
        who believe that

237
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,986
dream imagery              
     is basically symbolic.

238
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,621
Uh, if you subscribe       
     to that theory,

239
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,756
sam could signify          
     any number of things.

240
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:51,792
Could be a need for you     
    to get back in touch        
    with your inner self.

241
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,812
Could be, uh,                  
 spiritual awakening.

242
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,613
Could be you and your god.     
            It's sam.

243
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,249
It's sam.          
                 It's sam.

244
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:02,553
Oh, god,                    
    some evil, disgusting,      
    perverted little part of me

245
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,856
is attracted to sam.

246
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm gonna kill him.         
 Now, rebecca,

247
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:07,841
it's not his fault.

248
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:09,744
Sam doesn't know               
 what your dreams are.

249
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,979
You're right,              
     and he can never know.

250
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,831
Because if it ever, ever   
     got out

251
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,217
that i have been having        
 sex dreams all week about sam,

252
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:19,670
i could never, ever show    
    my face in this bar again.

253
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,821
Well, fear not.

254
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,623
You have confided              
 in professionals.

255
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:23,924
Your trust is sacred.

256
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,326
Thank you.

257
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,383
[Laughing]

258
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,044
[coughing]

259
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,079
whoa! Hands up in the air.

260
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,347
You ok?

261
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,515
[Laughing]

262
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,184
what's so funny?

263
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,820
I'm sorry, uh.

264
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,073
I can't tell you.   
            It's--it's--it's...

265
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:16,744
this is not something          
 that a man can tell a woman.

266
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:18,095
This is something that

267
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:20,831
a man can only tell        
     a whole crowd of people.

268
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,485
Hey, guys!

269
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:28,105
Hey, you nimrods,      
         trash flash!

270
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:29,856
(Carla)                        
 step into mr. Malone's office

271
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,376
and assume the trash position.

272
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,013
What's up?

273
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,381
[Laughing]

274
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:42,119
well, it appears that      
     our lovely miss rebecca

275
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:45,990
has been having        
         x-rated dreams about   
         a certain young man

276
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:47,858
that we all know and admire.

277
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,460
[All chuckling]

278
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,294
the guy with                   
 the wavy brown hair

279
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:54,231
who comes in here              
 all sweaty after bowling?

280
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,468
No, woody, me.

281
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,371
Thought you said               
 he was young.

282
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,158
Hey, how'd you                 
 find out, sammy?

283
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:07,678
Well, i accidentally        
    overheard rebecca telling   
    frasier and lilith.

284
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,962
[All exclaiming]

285
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,831
shrinks get                
     all the great scam, huh?

286
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,685
You ought to get an earful 
     of a mailman's day, pal.

287
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:15,902
Yeah, i do, cliff.

288
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,024
Now, fellas,

289
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,159
big question is how to

290
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:23,994
make use of            
         this information.

291
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:27,548
He's gonna make use            
 of this information.

292
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,899
I got a suggestion.

293
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,134
Shoot.

294
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,736
Now, if i were rebecca,

295
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,771
i guarantee                 
    this would work.

296
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,106
Somehow, you get me            
 to go to sleep.

297
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,341
Go on, go on.              
                     All right.

298
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,226
Now you sneak      
             into the room,

299
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,095
wait until              
        i'm dreamin' about you.

300
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:45,048
You gonna know when that is 
    because of all the moanin'  
    and rollin' around.

301
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,851
"Moaning," "rolling,"          
 good, good.

302
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,187
When i'm just at   
             my most receptive,

303
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,956
if you get my drift,   
         mmm-hmm.

304
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:55,592
You lay a kiss on me   
         that'll melt diamonds.

305
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,629
I wake up, but i think 
         i'm still dreaming,

306
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,397
so i don't resist.

307
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:03,934
And then we make       
         hot and sloppy         
         till the cops arrive.

308
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:08,939
Carla,                     
     you're a genius.

309
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,308
Rebecca's gonna go             
 for this in a big way.

310
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:14,027
The hell with rebecca. 
         It was my idea!

311
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,648
I'm gonna go get some stuff    
 to help her go to sleep.

312
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,816
Uh, woody, cover for me,   
     will you?                  
 You got it, sam.

313
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,602
Woody, would you    
            cover for me, too?

314
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:22,737
Where are you going?           
         Home.

315
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,922
I just remembered,             
 i left something turned on.

316
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,223
What?                  
                 Me.

317
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,367
[Whispering]           
         where's rebecca?

318
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,635
She's in the office.

319
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,386

         wait a second.

320
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,471
You're not gonna put           
 the moves on her               
 here in the bar, are you?

321
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,958
Well, i figured if i,      
     uh, try it here

322
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,392
and something goes wrong,

323
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,527
i'll just be embarrassed    
    in front of you guys.

324
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,530
But if i sneak             
     into her apartment         
     and something goes wrong,

325
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,949
i'll be embarrassed         
    in the back of a squad car.

326
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,202
Let's, uh, pour this   
         into a saucepan,

327
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,521
and put a little           
     low flame under it.

328
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,408
Uh, you're not going to try to 
 put her to sleep with          
 a warm cup of milk, are you?

329
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:04,845
Excuse me, cliff,       
        but have you slept with 
        over 1,000 women?

330
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,515
Put a low flame            
     under it, woody.

331
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,217
(Cliff)                        
 stop just before               
 it makes a skin.

332
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,551
Ok, one more thing here,

333
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,620
what do you think       
        is going to make her    
        go to sleep faster?

334
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,189
"Brahms'  <i>lullaby"</i>

335
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:18,192

00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:23,430
that question has              
 plagued mankind since          
 the beginning of time.

 of rome as somnus.

00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,525
You really want to     
         put her to sleep, sam, 
         record him.

342
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,065
Uh, rebecca,

343
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,033
could i, uh, speak to you  
     for a second?

344
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:46,002
Listen, i know i upset you  
    in the office this morning. 
     No, no, no.

345
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,305
It's me who should             
 be apologizing. I'm sorry.

346
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,123
I, um, was going               
 through something

347
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:51,575
that was                       
 sort of personal,

348
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,710
but i--i really shouldn't have 
 taken it out on you.

Oh, no. That's ok, honey.

 just a little off

Seem like i'm talking slowly?

00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:11,951
like never taking a chance,

434
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:14,320
always waiting for 
             something better   
             to come along.

435
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:16,173
What if something  
             doesn't come?

436
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,657
It will.

437
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:20,527
Sweetheart,            
         when was the last time

438
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:24,097
you had a close relationship   
 with a man?

439
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:26,666
Well, what do you              
 mean by close?

440
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,785
Close.

441
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:32,106
Oh, yeah, like, if you mean,   
 like, close, close, close,

442
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,373

443
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,892
just right before              
 i started working here.

444
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,861
3 years ago.

445
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,013
Has it been that long?

446
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:48,255
Oh, god, sam,

447
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,591
Maybe my dreams are right.

448
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:53,593
I mean, what the hell,

449
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,462

 my door.

You and i are going            
 to take a shot at it.
