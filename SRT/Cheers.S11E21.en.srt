00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:04,018
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,989
Hey, holy moly,
guacamole, Normie. Hey, what?

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,857
Huh?

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,559
See that guy down there?

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,078
I think that might
be Spanky McFarland

6
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,329
from the old Little Rascals.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,263
Get out.
Yeah, I think so.

8
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,931
Really?
Hey, I'll go ask him.

9
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:18,899
I'll go check it out.

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,903
(humming
The Little Rascals theme)

11
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,042
Hey, how are you doing, Sid?

12
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:30,011
Hi.
Hey, uh, my name's Cliff Clavin.

13
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,212
Hello, Cliff.

14
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:33,314
You know, I-I know
you've probably heard this

15
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:34,683
a thousand times before,

16
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:36,818
but you do resemble
that, uh, child actor

17
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,487
Spanky McFarland
from The Little Rascals.

18
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:40,305
Well, that's
because... 'Cause I'm one of

19
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,173
Little Rascals fan
there ever was.

20
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:44,476
I mean I've got every episode
on tape, you know.

21
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,727
Well, except "Free Eats" and,
uh, "Captain Spanky's Showboat."

22
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:48,563
That's great.

23
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:50,699
Yeah, Alfalfa,
Darla, Buckwheat.

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,733
(chuckles)

25
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:52,767
Hey, I got to confess,

26
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:55,286
I had quite a big crush
on Darla.

27
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,755
I'll tell you, you know,

28
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,523
if you were Spanky,
boy, I could sit here

29
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:00,057
and chew on your ear for hours,

30
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,161
you know, about the, you know,
"Happy Birthday, Mr. Hood"

31
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,630
and the "He-Man
Women Haters Club."

32
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,649
And remember the sound the cake
made coming out of the oven?

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,851
Was it...
(makes groaning noise)

34
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,352
Huh?

35
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:12,954
So, uh, are-are you Spanky?

36
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,088
Nope.

37
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:15,523
Ah.

38
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,558
Take care.

39
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,892
Catch you later.

40
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,161
You are Spanky, aren't you?

41
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:22,330
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,733

00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:30,872

Oh, no. Who's
this guy?

50
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,066
Huh? Oh.

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,769
Well, that's, uh, Mr. Kevin
Fogerty, our city councilman.

52
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,089
He's been there for
three consecutive terms.

53
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,225
Running for re-election now;
Nobody dares run against him.

54
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,661
He's also very, very rude
to, uh, voters

55
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:30,932
who call with perfectly normal
and good suggestions.

56
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,216
(camera clicks)

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,285
Okay, Mr. Clavin,
remember the rules:

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,950
You have to keep
at least 50 feet

59
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:38,122
from Mr. Fogerty
at all times.

60
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,341
Yeah.

61
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:41,609
All right, just to be safe,

62
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,360
I'd better go back
in the pool room.

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,813
I remember Fogerty.
Hmm?

64
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:48,500
He was here a couple of years
ago trying to get our votes.

65
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,151
NORM:
Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,419
He bought me a beer.

67
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,820
Did you vote for him?

68
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,522
He bought me a beer.

69
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,160
Something has to be done,
and the time is now.

70
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:03,331
There he goes, spouting a bunch
of meaningless platitudes.

71
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,900
Sure enough, the people are
lapping it up like milk.

72
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:09,437
Oh, the mentality of the voter
in this country fascinates me.

73
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,573
Someday, I ought to
do a paper about it.

74
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,575
What's-what's your problem
with Fogerty?

75
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,742
He's not a bad guy.

76
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,127
Oh. All
right, Sam.

77
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,362
Why don't you ask
him a question?

78
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,930
I'll bet you ten bucks
all he gives you

79
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,966
is some meaningless
politician's rhetoric.

80
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,932
Yeah, all right.

81
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,133
Come on.

82
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:24,552
You're on.

83
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,921
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Fogerty, sir.

84
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:28,889
Could I, uh, speak
to you for a second? Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,524
I'm Sam Malone; I'm
the owner of the bar.

86
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,377
And, uh, got a
question for you.

87
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,213
I'm a small businessman, and
I was just wondering, uh,

88
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,431
when is this economy
going to turn around?

89
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,167
I'm glad you asked that.

90
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:42,203
I say now is the time
to roll up our shirtsleeves

91
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,005
and get to the bottom of this.

92
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,074
The only way we're
going to defeat this thing

93
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,708
is if we all do it together.

94
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,078
I think you owe me ten bucks.

95
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:55,233
Hi.

96
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,069
Kevin Fogerty, City Council.

97
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,838
Kevin Fogerty, City Council.

98
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,107
I hope I have your vote
on election day.

99
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,176
And why, exactly, should I
vote for you, Mr. Fogerty?

100
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,328
Well, because I'm a hard worker.

101
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:08,630
I take a stand.

102
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,465
On what exactly?

103
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,199
The issues of the day.

104
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,568
Which are?

105
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,221
The things that concern
you and your family the most.

106
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:26,113
I think you're making
an ass out of yourself.

107
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:27,482
I am not!

108
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:30,851
I simply want the councilman
to say one concrete thing.

109
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:32,320
Yes, I understand.

110
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,588
You don't trust me.

111
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,323
A lot of people
don't trust politicians.

112
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:36,424
I know how it is.

113
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,559
I have been out there.

114
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,360
But what does that
have to do with...

115
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,045
May I finish, please?

116
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:44,665
Maybe we need someone to blame.

117
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,469
Maybe if we pick some
faceless person at city hall

118
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:50,805
to be responsible
for all our problems,

119
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,775
then we won't have to accept
any responsibility at all.

120
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,944
Well, people,
I say now is the time

121
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:57,678
to start looking in the mirror.

122
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:00,414
Because if this thing
is going to work,

123
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,583
we are all going to have
to make it work...

124
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,335
the way a bunch of people

125
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,788
made something work
at Lexington and Concord.

126
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:11,593
You may remember it;
It's called... America!

127
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:12,626
Yes! Bravo!

128
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:13,861
(cheering, applause)

129
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,968
But he didn't say anything!

130
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,738
Thank you, people,
for proving my point.

131
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,807
The voters of Boston are sheep!

132
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,979
Oh, I thought that was
just a Hanover thing.

133
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,114
Look, all I'm saying is
that when it comes to voting,

134
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:35,649
people just
shut off their brains.

135
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,152
I submit we could put
a chimpanzee on the ballot

136
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:39,587
and garner ten percent
of the vote.

137
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,588
(chuckles):
Whoa.

138
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,424
Two Hanover things in one day?

139
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,210
You're exaggerating
a little bit, aren't you?

140
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,262
No, no, Sam, I'm not.

141
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,996
Look, you know what?
I'll go you one better.

142
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,831
I'll bet we could
put Woody on the ballot

143
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,402
and get ten percent
of the vote.

144
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,602
Yeah, all right,
I'll take ten dollars of that.

145
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:55,437
All right, you're on.

146
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,871
You know, come to think of it,

147
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,974
this would make a fascinating
study of voter psychology.

148
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:02,811
I submit, if we just put
Woody's name on the ballot,

149
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:06,047
circulate a few posters
of his attractive smiling face

150
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,516
over some meaningless slogan,

151
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:11,920
come election day, we'll get
ten percent of the vote!

152
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,054
(people groaning) Come on, man.

153
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,239
FRASIER:
Oh, oh, okay!

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,272
I'll prove it to all of you.

155
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:16,674
I'll start the process
of getting his name

156
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:17,975
on the ballot
this very afternoon.

157
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,494
WOODY:
Oh, I-I don't know, Dr. Crane.

158
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:22,046
I'm not so sure I want to
get mixed up in all this.

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,748
Mixed up in what, Woody?

160
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,250
Well, Dr. Crane wants me
to run for City Council.

161
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,352
Oh, Woody,
that's a wonderful idea.

162
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,404
It is?

163
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,256
I'd be so proud
if you were a politician.

164
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,625
Uh, Kelly, I-I-I'm not gonna
get mixed up in politics.

165
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,244
Uh, you live your
life in a fishbowl.

166
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,612
Everybody hates you.

167
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,948
The press is always
criticizing you.

168
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,651
There's no way I'm running
for public office.

169
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,085
All right, Mr. Stubborn.

170
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,654
From now on,
you can dance naked

171
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:49,957
in front of the lava lamp
all by your lonesome.

172
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,928
Well, maybe just one term.

173
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,953
Well, step one of my plan
is complete.

174
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:06,491
Woody Boyd is now on the ballot
for City Council.

175
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,176
I'll be damned.
How'd you do that?

176
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,427
Well, it was really
no trouble at all.

177
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,464
I simply stood out in front of
a supermarket with a petition.

178
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,398
When people asked me
who I was supporting, I said,

179
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,869
"Woody Boyd, the man who stands
for the American way."

180
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,705
Well, the sheep couldn't sign
their names fast enough.

181
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,861
I also put up about, uh,
300 of these guys here.

182
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,831
300- you think that's
going to be enough?

183
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,147
Well, there's no need
to go crazy.

184
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,982
I only need to get ten percent
of the eligible vote.

185
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,151
CLIFF:
Well, in that case,

186
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,418
why don't you just put them up

187
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,629
on Carla's headboard?

188
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,459
Oh...

189
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,129
Clavin, Clavin, Clavin.

190
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,431
When are you going to learn?

191
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:51,002
See, now I have to retaliate.

192
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,470
No, you don't have to, Carla.

193
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,706
You know, we-we could just,
uh, don't even say anything,

194
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,074
you just forget
all about it, huh?

195
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,243
I can't forget;
You know that.

196
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:00,578
All right.

197
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,263
Well, uh, just get it
over with fast, then, will you?

198
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,665
(chuckles)

199
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,033
Yeah, all right.
Thank you.

200
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,568
No, that's for even asking.

201
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,136
You can't hurry an artist.

202
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,305
(laughing)

203
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,491
Woody Boyd?

204
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,759
Uh, right here.

205
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:17,094
Holly Matheson.
Boston Herald.

206
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,430
I understand you're
running for City Council.

207
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,431
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,900
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

209
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,002
Oh, I guess that would be okay.

210
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,170
(scoffs)

211
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,373
Here's where your great
experiment hits the wall, pal.

212
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,008
Well, maybe, maybe not.

213
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,210
It's all part
of the experiment.

214
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,529
Let's start with
our police force.

215
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,264
Morale is at
an all-time low.

216
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,433
Officers are
underpaid and overworked.

217
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,901
What do you plan to do?

218
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:42,903
Well, I don't know much
about big city stuff.

219
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,573
I was raised on a farm.

220
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,124
Oh, I get it.

221
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:48,926
This is your hook.

222
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,429
You're the innocent farm boy
telling the big city slickers

223
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,198
to clean up the barn
and all that farm crap.

224
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,934
Well, no, it's not crap.

225
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,903
If you don't clean up
the barn, you get rats.

226
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:01,655
Yes, yes.

227
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,258
So in other words, it's time
to clean up city hall.

228
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,178
Well, I'm just saying that,
uh, if you let the rats go,

229
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,515
then, uh, you know, pretty
soon you don't have a barn.

230
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,984
You just have kind of a...

231
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,986
a rat place.

232
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,658
Okay.

233
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:23,428
So if we don't do something now,
we'll lose our fair city.

234
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,196
Blah, blah, blah.

235
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,164
You know, my
Grandpa Boyd caught

236
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,533
a rat the size of a pig.

237
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,804
Or was it a pig
the size of a rat?

238
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,956
Well, either way,

239
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,558
it was a big hit
at the county fair.

240
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,962
So what you're saying is,

241
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:44,281
there are no easy answers.

242
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,433
Well, not for me, there aren't.

243
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,734
You really believe
this farm stuff, don't you?

244
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,711
With all my heart.

245
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,579
Well, it's kind of
a cornball message,

246
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,281
but you just might be the kind
of guy who can sell that stuff.

247
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,349
Oh, thanks, ma'am.

248
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,472
Woody, that was
absolutely brilliant.

249
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,374
(scoffs):
Some reporter.

250
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,698
She didn't even want to
ask me about politics.

251
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,151
Oh, listen to this.

252
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,786
"The race in District Three
is the one to watch

253
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,872
"between incumbent
Kevin Fogerty

254
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:28,459
"and his idealistic
young challenger Woody Boyd.

255
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,961
"Even this cynical reporter
was impressed

256
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,405
by Boyd's simple,
straightforward approach."

257
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,799
(laughs)

258
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,851
Well...

259
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,519
according to the latest poll,

260
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:42,507
candidate Boyd now
stands at eight percent.

261
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,341
Now, do I need to go
for the two remaining percent,

262
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,177
or have I proved my point?

263
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,211
You have proved your point.

264
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:48,813
You win.
(laughs)

265
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,597
Very well.

266
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:50,765
Thank you very much.

267
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,366
Guess I can put an end
to this farce.

268
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,934
I'll take the posters
down tomorrow.

269
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,236
Hey, hey, turn on the news.

270
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,638
Fogerty just got arrested
for public drunkenness.

271
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,056
You're kidding.
(turns on TV)

272
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,107
Good God.

273
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,408
This will be a major scandal.

274
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,310
You know, this could
really rock his campaign.

275
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:07,014
I bet the person who's running
against him is pretty happy.

276
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,199
REPORTER:
...Councilman Fogerty's ratings

277
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,250
in the polls...

278
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:15,072
and newcomer Boyd
appears to be poised...

279
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:18,409
Yeah, I bet if we just printed
up a few more posters...

280
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:21,645
Yeah, and maybe, uh, did some
door-to-door canvassing...

281
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,715
CARLA:
Yeah, and made some personal appearances...

282
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,883
We're going for it!

283
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,685
(cheering)

284
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,136
Whoo!

285
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,170
Going for what?

286
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,739
I missed a step.

287
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,701
Hi. I'd like to tell you
about candidate Woody Boyd.

288
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,868
He's challenging the status quo,

289
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,937
and he's listening to the voters
for a change.

290
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:48,739
And while I have you
on the phone,

291
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:52,443
could I get two large pizzas
with everything?

292
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:56,196
So, uh, you don't plan
to vote for Woody Boyd?

293
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,799
Uh-huh. Now, according
to the phone book,

294
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,435
your address is 151 Richmond?

295
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:06,073
Do your children like
to run and play?

296
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,927
No, it's Boyd. B-O-Y-D.

297
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,629
Mm-hmm. Well,
he's destined for greatness.

298
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,831
He's one of the sharpest
young political minds

299
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:16,433
to come along
in quite a long time.

300
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,636
He's absolutely brilliant.

301
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,139
Me?

302
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,740
Well, I am, um...

303
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,208
I'm 26.

304
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,011
You're not 26!

305
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,746
If Woody can be brilliant,
I can be 26.

306
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,419
Wow. I've never seen
all you guys work so hard.

307
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,955
Yeah, well...
Paul, you see,

308
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,993
most of us guys who hang
around here day in, day out,

309
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,296
we frankly don't have much
going for ourselves, and...

310
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,431
Woody here has a shot at...

311
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,049
actually making the big time.

312
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,736
It's like he...
he stands for all of us losers.

313
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,071
Even me?

314
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,839
Especially you, Paul.

315
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,676
Wow.

316
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:03,864
Uh, everyone, I'd, uh,
like your attention, please.

317
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:05,583
As you know, it's just...

318
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:08,319
48 hours until
the big election day,

319
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:11,422
and I've been charting
our progress up until now,

320
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:15,759
and I'd like to say
with all confidence that I'm gonna win!

321
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,495
We're gonna win!

322
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,098
Woody Boyd is gonna be the next city
councilman of this fair district!

323
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,302
(cheering, whooping)

324
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,503
Gosh, Dr. Crane...
Not now, Woody, I'm talking.

325
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,772
Now, listen, I know
we're not in the lead,

326
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,774
but I can smell victory!

327
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,477
Now, I just want you all
to keep up the heat.

328
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:36,247
Let's not stop until we
reach the victory party!

329
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,733
(cheering, whooping)

330
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,653
Well, Carla,
I see you retaliated.

331
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:48,926
Yeah, it turns out, uh,

332
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,463
she slipped me a Mickey, so
I'd fall asleep in the pool room.

333
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,932
As it turns out,
I woke up to find

334
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,402
that she had tied
my shoelaces together.

335
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:05,075
Fortunately, I noticed it
before I took my first step.

336
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,711
Good try, Carla.

337
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,646
Better luck next time.

338
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:12,266
Excuse me, I have
to go do my route now.

339
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:18,605
Excuse me.

340
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,741
Kevin Fogerty, City Council.

341
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,843
I just wanted you to know

342
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,546
that I have always
supported you people.

343
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:32,019
Too little, too late, Fogerty.

344
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,738
Woody Boyd.

345
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,073
Hi, Mr. Fogerty.

346
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,910
So you're the young man
everyone is talking about.

347
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,428
Well, it's nice to finally
meet you in person.

348
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,949
You know, you remind me
of a bright, young comer

349
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:48,286
that took this town
by storm 30 years ago.

350
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,222
His name was Kevin Fogerty.

351
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,956
Any relation?

352
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,141
(chuckles):
Ah!

353
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:58,144
Boy, I'm looking forward
to our debate tomorrow.

354
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,763
Debate?

355
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,148
Of course-
on Channel Six.

356
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,250
It's a tradition whenever
there's a challenger.

357
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:05,252
I think the voters
deserve to hear

358
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,488
our stands on
the issues, don't you?

359
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,773
Oh, yes, of course we do.

360
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,175
And we'll be there, sir.
Good!

361
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:14,295
I'm really looking forward
to hearing your opinions.

362
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:18,916
I don't know if I can handle
a debate, Dr. Crane.

363
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,751
I'm not very good at
rendering my opinions.

364
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,320
Nothing to worry about, Woody.

365
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,189
Just tell some more of those farm
stories- people seem to love those.

366
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,059
If that doesn't work, just say the
word "change" about a hundred times.

367
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,328
Come on, let's go
to my place and work on it.

368
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,496
Trust me, Woody, with
my brains and your smile,

369
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:34,298
who knows how high we can go.

370
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,134
Congressman, senator...

371
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,935
(breathily):
Who knows?

372
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:42,072
(band playing
"Hail to the Chief")

373
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,842
(band continues playing)

374
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,376
(song ends)

375
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:53,583
Would you please
raise your right hand

376
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:56,353
and repeat after me.

377
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:59,924
I, Woodrow Tiberius Boyd,

378
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,926
do solemnly swear...

379
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,562
I, Woodrow Tiberius Boyd,
do solemnly swear...

380
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,226
that I will faithfully execute

381
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,167
the office of the President
of the United States

382
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,837
and will, to the
best of my ability,

383
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,339
preserve, protect and defend

384
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,842
the Constitution of
the United States.

385
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,477
That I will faithfully...

386
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,014
faithfully...

387
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,249
Execute.

388
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,152
Execute...

389
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,020
The.
...the...

390
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,089
Office.
...office...

391
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:33,357
Of.
...of...

392
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,691
The.
...the...

393
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:37,094
President of the
United States. Oh, I-I got that.

394
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:40,430
The President
of the United States...

395
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:43,000
And will, to the
best of my ability,

396
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,202
preserve and protect and defend

397
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,172
the Constitution of
the United States.

398
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,976
Oh, boy.

399
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,211
And.
...and...

400
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,247
Will.
...will...

401
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,614
Protect.
...protect...

402
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,751
WOODY:
Oh, yeah?

403
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:02,036
Well, I'm calling your bluff.

404
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:05,639
I'm firing my missiles, too-
all of 'em!

405
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,141
Who was that, Woody?

406
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,542
(deep rumbling)

407
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,077
How the hell should I know?

408
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,946
The phone rings, I answer it.

409
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,664
(booming explosion)

410
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:22,289
(screaming)

411
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:34,084
Woody! Thank God
I got to you in time!

412
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,586
I've got to talk...

413
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,254
What are you reading?

414
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:39,490
Well, I'm boning up
on the Constitution

415
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:43,327
in case I ever decide
to run for Congreff.

416
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,395
It's Congress, Woody.

417
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,566
In colonial times,
the S's looked like F's.

418
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:50,834
Oh. Well, if I'm elected,

419
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,903
that's the first thing
I'm gonna change.

420
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,738
Yes. Woody, I'm sorry.

421
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,606
There's one thing
I've got to tell you.

422
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,197
Listen, you have got
to withdraw from the election.

423
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:00,961
What do you mean, Dr. Crane?

424
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:03,280
Well, aside from the nagging
feeling that your election

425
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,567
might actually mean
the extinction of all life as we know it,

426
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,219
you're just not a politician.

427
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:11,004
Yeah, but you said
it would be easy.

428
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,624
In fact, you said not being
a politician was my hook.

429
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,825
I know, Woody, I'm sorry.

430
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,677
Listen, I-I shouldn't
have led you on.

431
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,998
I guess I was just drawn in
by the promise of power.

432
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:23,083
Oh, but, Dr. Crane...

433
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,836
No, no "but, Dr. Cranes"-
now, Woody, just listen to me.

434
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,805
Listen, the right to vote is...

435
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,640
it's far too sacred
to cheapen by some...

436
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,776
some vain psychological
experiment.

437
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,711
I mean, your
winning an election

438
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,746
without knowing anything
at all about politics...

439
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,850
it would just make
a mockery of the entire democratic process.

440
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:42,519
Woody, you have to withdraw.

441
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,590
Well, there's no sense in
arguing with you, Dr. Crane.

442
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:50,293
I mean, next to Mr. Clavin,
you're the smartest guy I know.

443
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:55,332
But what about the debate?

444
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,418
They're expecting me
to go over there.

445
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,386
Woody, you'll just
have to make a...

446
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,206
a simple speech
and gracefully bow out.

447
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,242
Oh. Well, I guess you're
right, Dr. Crane.

448
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,511
Gotta do what I gotta do.

449
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,313
It's too bad, though.

450
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:13,183
I was really looking forward
to being a good city councilman

451
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,270
and working hard
to make sure that...

452
00:19:16,304 --> 00:19:19,923
every person in my district
was ensured...

453
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,193
life, liberty...

454
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,462
and the purfuit of happineff.

455
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:36,690
MODERATOR (on TV): Welcome to the District
Three City Council candidates debate.

456
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:40,077
To my immediate right is
Councilman Kevin Fogerty.

457
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,546
(booing, jeering)

458
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,333
To his right is
the Challenger, Woodrow Boyd.

459
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,303
(cheering, whistling)

460
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:51,054
Before we begin the questions,

461
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,924
each candidate will make
a brief opening statement.

462
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,141
Mr. Boyd.

463
00:19:56,577 --> 00:20:00,681
Well... this is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

464
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:05,018
As much as I've enjoyed
getting to know you all, I-I...

465
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,988
I have to bow out of the race.

466
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:10,190
(others murmuring)
SAM: What the hell's

467
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:12,843
Fact is, I'm really
not much of a politician.

468
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,879
In fact, I really don't
know much about anything.

469
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,217
I-I... I don't know,
I just... I just wanted to...

470
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:24,021
(crying): thought it'd be nice to be a...
city councilman.

471
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,105
I mean...

472
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,542
I'd do a good job, too,
I promise!

473
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,111
(sniffling):
How bad could I screw up?

474
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,715
I mean, it's not like a
councilman could declare war or anything!

475
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,684
I-I couldn't, could I?

476
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,237
It's just one vote!

477
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,940
I mean, would it kill you
to vote for me?

478
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,775
KELLY:
Oh, don't cry, Woody!

479
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,111
Oh, well, this is...
this is my wife Kelly,

480
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:50,681
and she deserves better
than just a simple bartender.

481
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,716
Oh, it's all right.

482
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,901
I love you, Woody.

483
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:56,136
WOODY:
I love you, too, Kelly.

484
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,289
In fact, we both love you.

485
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,641
Both?

486
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02,025
Yes.

487
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:07,314
This probably isn't the ideal
time to tell you, but...

488
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:11,101
you're gonna be a daddy.

489
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,370
WOODY:
I'm gonna be...

490
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,405
(laughs):
I'm gonna...

491
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,858
Did you hear that, everybody?
I'm gonna be a daddy!

492
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,360
(laughing)

493
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,963
I'm gonna be a daddy!

494
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:33,057
TV ANNOUNCER: WATW is now projecting
a winner in District Three.

495
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:37,027
Challenger Woody Boyd has
been elected to City Council.

496
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:39,779
(cheering)

497
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,182
CLIFF:
All right, way to go, Woody!

498
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,068
I am so proud of you!

499
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:47,854
Hey, hey, huh?
Good luck, all right?

500
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:49,623
Don't forget that
little talk we had

501
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,158
about extending
unemployment benefits.

502
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,759
Consider it done,
Mr. Peterson.

503
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,431
Oh, hey, Dr. Crane.

504
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:58,565
Listen, uh...

505
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,867
I just wanted
to thank you, you know?

506
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,071
Uh, without you,
I couldn't have done this.

507
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,871
In fact, you're
directly responsible.

508
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,573
No one can prove that.

509
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,943
I know you don't have a lot
of faith in me, Dr. Crane,

510
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,428
but I'm gonna
prove you're wrong.

511
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,780
I'm gonna study hard
on all the issues,

512
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,600
and I'm gonna be
a great city councilman,

513
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,770
and maybe this is just the first
rung on a very long ladder,

514
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,805
and you're the man
who made it happen.

515
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,342
(booming explosion)
