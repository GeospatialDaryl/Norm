1
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:06,809
JUST THREE FRIENDS

2
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:10,354
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Sam.

3
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:15,276
I think I found the answer
to the robberies in this neighbourhood.

4
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:18,612
- I'm gonna get an aIarm.
- This is better.

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,658
This friend of mine
has a gigantic attack dog.

6
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:28,164
He's gotten so mean that he can't handIe
him. That wouId be perfect protection.

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,335
Coach, maybe so, but
where are we gonna keep a dog?

8
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:38,424
I figured the office.

9
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,722
It's vicious!

10
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:50,144
- Get that dog the heII out of here.
- How?

11
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,439
I don't know. How did you get it in here?

12
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:56,609
He was in a cage when he came in
but he ate it.

13
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:01,071
This is ridicuIous.
How wiII I use my office?

14
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,203
In my profession, I've grown accustomed
to deaIing with beIIicose canines.

15
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,623
- AIIow me.
- What are you gonna do, mace him?

16
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:16,253
That's much too crueI. I find, deaIing with
animaIs, it's better to be kind yet firm.

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,594
- Sit!
- He is sitting, CIiff.

18
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:27,890
Nuke the beast, Sam.

19
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,590
Gee, Sam. I'm so sorry.

20
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:47,845
Get on the phone. I want the owner
to get the dog out of here.

21
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:51,598
- HeIIo, everyone.
- Goody, Diane is here.

22
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,310
This is Heather Landon,
my oIdest friend.

23
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:57,896
Meet her this morning?

24
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:06,155
That's CarIa. She Iikes a IittIe witty
repartee, she's just not capabIe of it.

25
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,994
And Heather, I want you
to meet someone eIse, over here.

26
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,456
- Coach Ernie Pantusso.
- How do you do?

27
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:19,168
Hi. CaII me Coach
or my other nickname.

28
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:22,880
- What other nickname?
- Satchmo.

29
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:27,634
Coach, you're thinking
of Louis Armstrong.

30
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:30,971
No, but I Iike that even better.

31
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:37,227
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Coffee, thank you.

32
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:43,650
Now, down here are CIiff and Norman,
two of our most reguIar reguIars.

33
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:47,362
- Hi.
- Hiya. PIeased to do you.

34
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:51,492
I mean, how do I meet me.

35
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:57,414
- Forget it.
- Smooth, CIiff.

36
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,417
I hate her.

37
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,754
I Iove this pIace.
It's got a great feeIing.

38
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:06,006
Yeah, I knew you'd Iike it.

39
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:09,426
Sam, I tried reaching the owner.
No answer.

40
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:13,138
- Thank you, Coach.
- You can caII me Louis Armstrong.

41
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:22,856
That must be Sammykins. He is
gorgeous, just as you described him.

42
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,401
- Hey.
- Hi.

43
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,113
You didn't do justice to his coIogne.

44
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,659
And you wanted me to switch. See?

45
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:39,206
Heather Landon, meet Sam
''I reek, therefore I am'' MaIone.

46
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:44,920
How do you do? Heather, I've heard
Diane babbIe about you a Iot.

47
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,130
You grew up together, right?

48
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:52,052
PracticaIIy. We were in grade schooI.
Heather hasn't changed a bit.

49
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,888
Must have been some grade schooI.

50
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:57,516
She moved into town.
Isn't that wonderfuI?

51
00:04:57,683 --> 00:05:02,062
I have to warn you. When we get
together, we get a IittIe goofy.

52
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,108
I shouId have brought a big Goofy.
I hear they're on saIe.

53
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:10,404
Cute and funny.
I think you got Iucky this time, Diane.

54
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,575
Just Iike the rest of them.
Hung up on Iooks, personaIity and styIe.

55
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:20,539
Heather and I were best friends
in the fourth grade.

56
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,791
We aIways got in troubIe.

57
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:28,588
Some of the things she got me to do!
Remember the prank phone caIIs?

58
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:33,260
This is the WTRM radio contest.

59
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:36,930
For a trip to Hawaii,
name three cars that start with P.

60
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,975
Go ahead.

61
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,185
Porsche, PIymouth and Pontiac.

62
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,857
No, I'm sorry. Those cars start with gas.

63
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:03,540
It's pathetic.

64
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,876
I'II show you the pIace.

65
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:09,671
Nice meeting you, Sam.
Sorry Diane got to you first.

66
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:14,176
I often regret there are so many women
and onIy one of me.

67
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,097
- Oh, boy.
- What's wrong, Sam?

68
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:22,642
- You're kidding. You didn't see that?
- See what?

69
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:27,898
- What are you taIking about?
- Guys, Diane's friend came on to me.

70
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:32,319
- You're crazy.
- You're with Diane. For her you're safe.

71
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:35,822
Forget about that.
I'm taIking about vibrations.

72
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:40,994
I know women.
Diane's friend wants me.

73
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:46,082
I know a thing or two. I've had
experience of this sort of thing.

74
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,920
- You, Norm?
- Yeah.

75
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:56,676
When I was dating Vera, her sister used
to prance around wearing a bikini

76
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:58,887
or fIimsy IittIe shorts or something.

77
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:03,600
She used to sit on my Iap.
Whisper in my ear how sexy I was.

78
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:08,939
So I did it. I asked her out.
She turned me down fIat.

79
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,982
Vera know this?

80
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:15,278
Yeah, Coach. She was there
and she was reaIIy furious.

81
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:17,489
I'm surprised she even married you.

82
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:21,952
The ceremony was in progress.
Wasn't much she couId do about it.

83
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:30,293
I know what you are taIking about,
but there's more going on here.

84
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,880
- She seems Iike such a sweet kid.
- Yeah.

85
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:40,929
Just as every author has had to work
among common peopIe for materiaI.

86
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,474
MuscIes!

87
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:51,690
I think Sammy's on to something here.

88
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:55,777
She's a vixen,
undressing every man with her eyes.

89
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:59,155
No wonder I feIt such a chiII.

90
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:01,324
That's our IittIe pub.

91
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:08,039
Diane, she hasn't seen aII of it yet.
You didn't show her Sam's office.

92
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:10,875
No, CarIa!

93
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:21,261
Just some of that witty repartee
you Iove.

94
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:25,307
That was a Iousy thing to do.

95
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:30,979
What the heII is that?

96
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:36,234
It's an attack dog a friend of mine
gave me. He's good.

97
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,989
- ExceIIent.
- Coach, get on the phone.

98
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:46,536
- Diane, are you aII right?
- Yes. You trained me weII.

99
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,747
Listen, I've reaIIy got to be going.

100
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:55,295
Oh, right. You and I and Sam wiII have
dinner tonight. I'm going to cook.

101
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:59,299
- Why?
- WeII, to ceIebrate.

102
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:04,137
Now that Heather's Iiving here
I want us aII to be good friends.

103
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:09,100
And I have a speciaI recipe to try.
My own veaI Oscar.

104
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:13,146
That's the award you get
if you can act Iike you Iike it.

105
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:20,570
Heather, do you mind hanging on?
I want to taIk to Diane in private.

106
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:25,200
Sure. I know what you're gonna do.
I'II finish my coffee.

107
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,744
OK. AII right.

108
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:31,456
- Sam, no answer yet.
- Just keep trying.

109
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:36,669
Look, sweetheart.
Hey, hey, come on.

110
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:43,843
Heather's OK, but I don't think
we shouId hang out too much.

111
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:50,100
- Why not?
- I don't think the two of us hit it off.

112
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:55,688
- You hit it off. She's nuts about you.
- I bet she is.

113
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:59,818
I didn't want to have to teII you
this because you're paIs.

114
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:03,947
But she's coming on to me gangbusters.

115
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:10,286
- Why do you Iook at me Iike that?
- I can't beIieve you're saying this.

116
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:15,834
I need heIp here. I don't have
much experience saying no to women.

117
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,796
The cIosest I've gotten is,
''Not now, we're Ianding.''

118
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,510
I'm just teIIing you this because
I think you ought to keep us apart.

119
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,181
- What?
- This is staggering.

120
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:34,602
Do you think every woman you see
is attracted to you?

121
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:39,399
I've had enough women come on to me
to know when it's happening.

122
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,986
WeII, I guess there's onIy one way
to convince you.

123
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:48,658
- Heather?
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?

124
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:51,995
- I'm going to ask her.
- No, don't do that.

125
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:56,666
I'm sorry if it embarrasses you
but it serves you right.

126
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,753
Heather, I'm sorry
if it makes you uncomfortabIe,

127
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,302
but I want to get it out of the way so
we can proceed to a Iasting friendship.

128
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:16,227
Sam just now mistook your innocent
fIirtation for a sexuaI overture.

129
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:21,733
WiII you pIease expIain to him
your reaI feeIings?

130
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:29,157
Sam, I want you
and I don't care who knows it.

131
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:32,368
- What?
- Gotcha!

132
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:41,210
You're very attractive, but for me to give
up my friendship, you'd have to be rich.

133
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,984
- See you tonight for dinner. Bye.
- See you Iater.

134
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:29,071
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
Those cars start with gas!

135
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,994
- Let's caII your mother now.
- Get out of here!

136
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:43,752
Whitey, whitey.
You're making a mistake.

137
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,838
What do you mean?

138
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:50,009
That so-caIIed friend of yours
is hot for Sam.

139
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:53,762
Everyone here is insane.
Why wouId you think that?

140
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:57,516
- Sam thinks it.
- Not any more, he doesn't.

141
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:00,144
I trust his first instincts.

142
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,062
When it comes to dames,

143
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:06,734
he's got an antenna
that picks up things we miss.

144
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:11,780
Dogs and cats know there's an
earthquake coming. No one can expIain.

145
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:15,659
It's simpIe.
There are cracks on the surface of...

146
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:18,496
Your brain.

147
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:22,833
PIease, don't distract Diane
from her suffering.

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,753
BeIieve me, you're being dense.

149
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,298
If Sam says she's hot for him,
bank on it.

150
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,804
It's Iudicrous.

151
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:42,311
The more I think about this, the more
I'm Iooking forward to tonight.

152
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,481
I've never had a woman
who's just a friend.

153
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:49,818
- This wiII be reaIIy good for me.
- Tonight?

154
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:54,281
Remember, you're cooking
that Oscar Mayer thingy.

155
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:59,536
VeaI Oscar. Sam,
I've had second thoughts about that.

156
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:04,124
Did you know that veaI
comes from baby cows?

157
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,754
If you think I wouId take part
in such a senseIess sIaughter...

158
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,925
Open a can of beans. The important
thing is getting to know Heather.

159
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:19,473
I think just being friends with a sexy
woman is a big step in my maturity.

160
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,102
We've got to get into the office
to get some stock.

161
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,939
We're out of gin
and the KahIua martinis aren't moving.

162
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:32,111
I don't think you shouId come to dinner
when there's so much on your mind.

163
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:35,906
- The dog and everything.
- I'II take care of the dog now.

164
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:38,492
I'm one step ahead of you, Sammy.

165
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:44,331
Mix a IittIe compIimentary cocktaiI
for the mutt.

166
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:49,670
I got hoId of the owner.
He said booze caIms him right down.

167
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:52,756
- I hope the guy's thirsty.
- Be carefuI.

168
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:16,530
Oh, Iook at him.

169
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:19,700
He's just a big puppy dog.

170
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:23,412
You're a big doggie, yes, you are.

171
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:28,709
There's onIy one probIem. The owner
said booze makes the dog amorous.

172
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:32,796
- Yeah? Right.
- Good boy. Yes.

173
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:36,133
He's a good boy. Wait, not that good.

174
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,641
Come on in, Heather.

175
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:50,773
Something smeIIs great.

176
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,151
I thank you. Dinner's aImost ready.
Make yourseIf at home.

177
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,324
- WeII, what do you think?
- About what?

178
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:03,827
About this dress.
I saw it and had to have it.

179
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:08,165
Why did you buy a dress
today of aII days?

180
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:12,794
You meet everybody, go out and get
a come-get-me dress. ExpIain.

181
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,173
I just saw it today.

182
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:23,305
Of course. You did what anyone
in your position wouId have done.

183
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:26,725
- Diane, is everything aII right?
- Yes.

184
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:30,312
- Are you sure?
- Of course. Back to work.

185
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,234
- I sure Iike Sam.
- SIut.

186
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:46,995
- What?
- I said thanks a Iot.

187
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,208
You're weIcome.

188
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,923
MaIone. One for dinner.

189
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:03,679
- Do you have reservations?
- PIenty, but I came anyway.

190
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:06,431
- How are you doing? Here you go.
- Nice. Thanks.

191
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:11,561
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

192
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:17,025
I want to apoIogise for this afternoon.
I was a IittIe crazy.

193
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:23,031
Here you go. I think the three of us
are gonna be reaI good friends now.

194
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,867
Yeah, I think so too.

195
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:29,454
- Me too. WeII, Iet's get to dinner.
- What's the rush?

196
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:33,166
The sooner we begin,
the sooner we can finish.

197
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,919
And then we can be finished.

198
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:57,232
- Isn't friendship great?
- Yeah.

199
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:02,404
What's that saying
about friends and Iovers?

200
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:06,742
Friends and Iovers.
Don't Ieave home without them.

201
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:10,328
Very funny. You're tickIish. You are.

202
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,873
You are. Oh, no. PIease, pIease!

203
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,833
Dinner time!

204
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:22,591
You don't have to shout.
We can hear you.

205
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:27,554
Of course. Hunger makes me
want to shout. Now, come on.

206
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:30,974
Sorry I don't have pIace cards.

207
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,060
We'II put Sam in the middIe
so we can share him.

208
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,229
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

209
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:40,859
I think this is gonna be great. Just
the three of us. Three good friends.

210
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:44,529
- Like Quartos, Athos and Aramus.
- There you go.

211
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,783
I don't think Sam knows that reference.

212
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:52,579
I may not read books, but I know
good music. Supremes, right?

213
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:56,416
- FabuIous.
- Sometimes I surprise her.

214
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,378
- I bet you do.
- Here we go.

215
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:03,089
Hope you didn't have spaghetti for Iunch.

216
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,595
- I thought we were having veaI Oscar.
- There are remnants in the sauce.

217
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:13,683
I thought we weren't gonna do anything
with veaI.

218
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,479
This sucker was aIready dead.

219
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:22,442
- WeII, it Iooks divine, Diane.
- Thanks. <i>Bon appetit.</i>

220
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:28,865
Remember the way
we used to eat ''pasghetti''?

221
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,660
- No.
- Like this.

222
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:46,508
That was good.

223
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,677
AII right. Let me try.

224
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:59,396
You got some sauce
on your bIouse there.

225
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:03,024
Thanks for your discretion.

226
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:05,277
This is wonderfuI spaghetti.

227
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:12,117
And the pasta is cooked just perfectIy.

228
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:16,997
It's firm yet it yieIds to the bite.
That's exactIy the way it shouId be.

229
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,749
Here. Take a bite off the end of this.

230
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,086
- See? Perfect.
- Try mine.

231
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,548
Yours is good too.

232
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,635
Boy.

233
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:43,398
This garIic bread is magnificent.
Here, have some of mine.

234
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:47,694
- Hot, hot, hot.
- You don't even have to chew it.

235
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:51,239
You just set it in your mouth and it meIts.

236
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,492
Goodies, goodies.

237
00:20:56,077 --> 00:21:00,623
- You have a IittIe sauce right there.
- I don't wanna waste it.

238
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,252
No, on the other side there.
There we are.

239
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:07,255
Come on!

240
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:11,301
- Stop it right now. I mean it!
- What?

241
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,511
What?

242
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:17,891
You know what.
You know perfectIy weII what.

243
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:20,727
Think I don't know what's going on?

244
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:24,272
Spaghetti, sauce, bread.
Have you no shame?

245
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:30,904
- What the heII's the matter with you?
- I know what that was aII about.

246
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:35,033
You think I don't know
what noodIes mean in sexuaI Iingo?

247
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,162
And sauce. I read my Freud.

248
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:42,415
We were just enjoying the meaI.

249
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:44,834
Don't give me that.
That meaI's inedibIe.

250
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:51,966
You're doing the same thing I did
this afternoon and you caIIed me nuts.

251
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:57,138
No, Sam, it's aII right.

252
00:21:57,305 --> 00:22:02,477
It's not surprising. I'm an outgoing
person. PeopIe misinterpret it.

253
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:06,397
- I'm just surprised it came from you.
- Yeah. Me too.

254
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:17,534
What am I saying? I must reaIIy be
paranoid, mustn't I?

255
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:24,415
It's happened to me before.
It's happened to everyone.

256
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,626
Heather...

257
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:30,004
I'm so sorry.

258
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:32,215
She didn't mean it, Heather.

259
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,805
How can you be eating now?

260
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,016
I've eaten through worse than this.

261
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:51,776
- Goodbye.
- Heather, where are you going?

262
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:56,531
- You're not Ieaving, are you?
- Paranoid or not, she's uncomfortabIe.

263
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:59,367
HonestIy, no.

264
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:08,251
Our friendship is the most important
friendship in my Iife.

265
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:14,382
And I wouId never, never do anything
to intentionaIIy hurt it.

266
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,593
PIease forgive me and stay.

267
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:22,599
Of course. I can't throw away 20 years.

268
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:29,314
That's beautifuI.

269
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,318
You know, I just wanna thank you
for Ietting me be part of this.

270
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:37,447
- That was very sweet.
- Sam. You are so sweet.

271
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,657
Hey, weII...

272
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:24,952
