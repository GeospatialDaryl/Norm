00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,798
A DlTCH lN TlME

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,310
- Good afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,995
- What'll you have, Normie?
- A 1 929 Lafitte Rothschild, Coach.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,310
Or a beer,
whatever everyone's having.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,996
Haven't heard much lately about your
quest to sire an heir for the old throne.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,038
- So how goeth the baby-making?
- Not good.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,113
Vera thinks it's my fault she's not
pregnant. Says l'm not trying.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,350
l hope before you answered harshly,

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,718
you took into account her frustration
in the maternal instinct department.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,509
- l said, ''Drop dead in a ditch.''
- Perfect.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,958
l used to think that sleeping was the
greatest pleasure you could have in bed.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,111
Now l'm sure of it.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,114
Norm, what's the matter?
Don't you like having sex with your wife?

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,955
We're not exactly what each other
wants in a sexual partner.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,750
For example, she wishes l looked
a little more like Charles Bronson.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,072
And l wish she looked a little less
like Charles Bronson.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,758
Carla, what do you think
of my new cologne?

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,955
- What do you think?
- l like it.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,839
When will l be able to see again?

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,149
Thank you.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,392
- You have customers waiting.
- Right away.

22
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,358
Will someone lead me to them?

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,750
- White wine, please.
- White wine.

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,514
Coach, l'll handle this one.

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,114
l hope this doesn't embarrass you
too much,

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,273
but you have the most
beautiful eyes that l have ever seen.

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,149
l kinda get flustered, but it's nice to hear.

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,549
lf l said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,995
Even l've heard that one.

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,029
l'm not doing too well with my patter.
Maybe l ought to rely on my looks.

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,236
Have you seen this one?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,470
l guess l'm just a sucker
for sophistication.

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,270
Now l've charmed your socks off,
wanna go to dinner with me?

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,352
You know a place
that doesn't require socks?

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,159
l could find one. So what do you say?

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,835
l can't leave yet.
l came to see somebody.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,399
Who?

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,672
So you two know each other, huh?

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,275
Nothing gets by this guy.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,838
Sam, this is my friend Amanda Boyer.
Amanda, this is my friend, Sam Malone.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,073
You're gonna have to excuse us here,
l think we're on our way out to dinner.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,597
Actually, l came by to see you.
You wanna have lunch sometime?

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,638
Lunch sometime...
Are you two going out together?

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,031
You're pretty sharp yourself there,
Diane.

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,079
Before you do, could l speak with you
about a problem, Sam?

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,038
- Trouble in the back room.
- lt's not about me, is it?

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,077
Don't be silly.

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,879
That woman's a mess.

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,349
- Don't go out with her.
- Why not?

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,195
l can't tell you now.
Just trust me for once.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,794
You'll have to give me a hint.

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,913
l really can't say anything.

53
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,789
l can't believe
you're so blatantly jealous.

54
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,475
You still can't stand the sight
of me with another woman, huh?

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,713
My heart goes out to any living creature
in your company.

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,635
One of these days you're gonna realise

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,715
that if you want to get back together
with me, you'll have to talk a little nicer.

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,189
Sam...

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,230
- You are an unmitigated egomaniac.
- Too little, too late.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,074
Good night.

61
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,035
You know, Normie, l was just thinking.

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,159
When you and Vera have the baby,
you'll have to give it a name, right?

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,595
We might name it, yeah.

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,673
When it comes time to name the baby,
you should consider Barry.

65
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,831
What's so special about Barry?

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,231
He's a whizz with names.
He gave me my nickname.

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,158
- Coach?
- What?

68
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,312
Never mind.

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,995
As l was saying,
Barry gave me my nickname, Coach.

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,711
That was inventive. You were a coach,
so he called you Coach.

71
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,950
You know, you're probably right, Larry.

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,069
l always thought he gave me the name
because l never flew first class.

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,834
We won't need Barry's help.
We've got a list of names to fight over.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,675
Once the baby's born
we'll fight over boy names or girl names.

75
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,597
You don't have to wait
till the baby's born if you use sonar.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,313
Yeah, Sonar's a beautiful name.

77
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,949
- Hey, everybody.
- Sam.

78
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,475
What happened?
That was a long dinner.

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,679
This is pitiful, you wearing
your heart on your sleeve like that.

80
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,116
- How did you and Amanda get along?
- She's OK, l guess.

81
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,877
Not triple A, but the food was good and
she's got pretty good table manners.

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,033
High praise from a man who thinks
mashed potatoes are finger food.

83
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,078
So you didn't make any plans
to see each other again?

84
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,676
l like it when a woman is hot for me,
but this is ridiculous.

85
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,877
lt's not your business,
but l might call her again.

86
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,792
Oh, no.

87
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,749
l wish Frasier weren't
at that nerve-ending symposium.

88
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,310
l guess l have to tell you the truth.

89
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,835
Amanda and l became friends at...

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,036
...a place.

91
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,988
That's pretty fascinating.
You'll have to fill me in on that later.

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,594
The place was Goldenbrook.

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,433
The booby hatch?

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,434
Oh, no, she looked so normal.

95
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,795
Were you guys cellmates or something?

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,674
There are no cells at Goldenbrook.

97
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,799
l was there of my own volition
as were a lot of other normal people

98
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,476
who just needed a little time
to rest and sort out their feelings

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,200
under constant psychiatric supervision.

100
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,230
l shouldn't even be talking to you.

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,915
She wouldn't be out
if she still had problems.

102
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,832
You're out.

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,991
What exactly is wrong with that kid?

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,277
l didn't want to say because
we did group therapy together

105
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,591
and l didn't want to violate
her confidence.

106
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,595
l guess l have to tell you now.
Please don't ever tell another soul.

107
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,234
- Amanda is obsessive with men.
- Oh, my God, no!

108
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,669
Wait a second. What does that mean,
exactly? She likes men a lot?

109
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,752
When she decides she wants a man,

110
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,438
she becomes excessively preoccupied
and possessive, and totally irrational.

111
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,989
Oh, you mean kinda like you...landa.

112
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,391
Yolanda Johnson. You don't know her.
Very obsessive woman.

113
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,272
She is nothing like Youlanda.

114
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,076
Listen, l wasn't thinking about it,

115
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,075
but if l ever do go out with her again,
the first sign of trouble, l'll back off. OK?

116
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,075
Wait a second, what's an example
of obsessive behaviour?

117
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,190
Mom, Dad, there he is,
the man l'm gonna marry.

118
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,716
This is an example.

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,878
Sam, these are my parents,
Mona and Todd.

120
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,272
- Hello, Sam.
- We've heard so much about you.

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,112
When?

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,558
On the drive over here.
lt was a long drive.

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,429
- l feel like l know you.
- Daddy, stop it.

124
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,912
Mom and Dad came to visit me and l
thought it'd be nice for them to meet you.

125
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,631
- Can we have a word in private?
- Hi, Amanda. Mona, Todd.

126
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,033
Sam l need to talk to you
about the inventory. We'll be right back.

127
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,439
That girl looks familiar.
ls she the one l met on Basket Day?

128
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,159
What were you going to do
when l interrupted?

129
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,515
Get rid of her before this gets serious.

130
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,719
Sam, better get out there. She's picking
silver patterns with her parents.

131
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,351
Yeah, l told them fleurs-de-lis
are passé, they won't listen to me.

132
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,553
We're trying to have
a private conversation.

133
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,792
We're not trying to be nosy,
just go ahead.

134
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,356
Very well.

135
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,152
You can't give her your standard
prearranged speech for dumping women.

136
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,869
l do not have a standard prearranged
speech for dumping women.

137
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,871
Every situation is different.

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,158
For example, the speech l dumped you
with would be totally inappropriate.

139
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
l don't think you dumped me.

140
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,152
You see? That was the beauty of it.

141
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,838
Come on, l couldn't possibly
have one speech for every situation.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,070
He's got six.

143
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,437
l think this one calls for number three:

144
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,558
''lt's times like these,
l'm ashamed to be a man.''

145
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,632
- Get out!
- Wait a minute, Diane.

146
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,759
Sam's a very close personal friend.
He's in a crisis and l don't think...

147
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,195
OK, have a couple of beers on me.

148
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,759
Sammy, you know where to find us
if you need any help.

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,513
- Oh, boy.
- Sam...

150
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,549
That woman out there is very vulnerable.

151
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,748
Whatever you say to her
has to be sensitive and real.

152
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,799
Otherwise the consequence
could be horrendous.

153
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,520
What do you mean by that?

154
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,468
She could do something ghastly again.

155
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,074
- You don't mean...
- Yes, suicide.

156
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,676
Oh, thank God!
l thought l was in danger there.

157
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,515
No, that's not what l meant.
You're making me a nervous wreck.

158
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,399
Just tell me what to say
so she doesn't hurt herself.

159
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,028
- l wish l knew.
- Come on, come on.

160
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,192
- She'll try to manipulate you.
- OK.

161
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,271
Be strong. Don't waver.

162
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,752
- And ease into the rejection gently.
- OK, do you think that'll work?

163
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,878
lf not, have a nice honeymoon.

164
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,111
- Hi, l'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- That's OK.

165
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,353
They like you a lot.
You make a wonderful first impression.

166
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,559
lt's my best one. Amanda, l...

167
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,397
Please, please don't dump me!
Please, Sam, give me another chance.

168
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,553
l shouldn't have brought my parents,
that was stupid and impulsive of me.

169
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,359
l don't even like them,
l'll get rid of them.

170
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,795
No, no. Wait.

171
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,034
l was just gonna say l wonder
if they would like to have a drink.

172
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,355
No, thank you, they don't drink.
But thank you for thinking of them.

173
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,033
You're welcome.

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,998
- Then l was gonna say...
- No! Please, Sam...

175
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,280
Would you just please let me finish
before you jump to conclusions?

176
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Now just sit down
and don't say anything.

177
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,390
Sorry.

178
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,236
lt's OK.

179
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,478
l like you and l respect you
too much not to be honest.

180
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,029
Now l'm sorry if l misled you,

181
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,351
but l just don't want to pursue
this relationship.

182
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,710
l'm so embarrassed and ashamed...

183
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,150
...and tired. l'm very tired.

184
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,876
l'm sorry, Sam, for everything.
Goodbye, Sam.

185
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,794
- Are you all right?
- Oh, sure.

186
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,030
lt's my fault.

187
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,997
You are such a nice guy.

188
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,235
Please don't blame yourself
for anything that has ever happened.

189
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,711
Or anything that's going to happen.

190
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,153
Whoa, wait a second.

191
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,550
What do you mean by that?

192
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,829
Sam, you don't have to worry about me
any more. Remember? We're through.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,357
l didn't mean the bad 'through',
l meant the good 'through'.

194
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,196
What's the good 'through'?

195
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,753
That's where we would
go out to dinner right now

196
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,515
and then maybe have a drive
down the Cape,

197
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,557
and see each other tomorrow.

198
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,190
The Cape would be pretty tonight.
l'd like that, Sam.

199
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,433
There, you see how fun
'through' can be?

200
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,474
l'll get my parents and we'll drop them off
at some bus stop.

201
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,916
- You have another date with her, right?
- l wouldn't call it exactly a date.

202
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,310
lt's more like a lifetime commitment.

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,949
My goodness, you and Vera have
compiled quite a list of baby names.

204
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,272
Yeah, we think up names
when we make love.

205
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,357
lt kinda helps to pass the time.

206
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,715
May l suggest you add one more
to the boys' list?

207
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,192
- My favourite has always been Toby.
- Toby?

208
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,309
Why don't you just name him Precious
or Pumpkin Pie and be done with it?

209
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,270
My ex may not be a class act,
but he's got a first-rate male name, Nick.

210
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,032
- lt's on the list.
- Good.

211
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,031
You ought to have Sam down there.

212
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,556
- Sam's here, right next to Ernie.
- Thank you, Norm.

213
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,111
lt looks like my buddy's
got all the bases covered.

214
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,112
- Where's my name?
- What?

215
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,316
Clifford. Where's Clifford?

216
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,070
Come on, name a kid Cliff?
Have a heart!

217
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,516
You got every other male
name there except Zeus.

218
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,877
Zeus? l like that, Zeus.

219
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,792
Diane, you're back. Good.

220
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,397
You might like to know l finally
handled that situation with Amanda,

221
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,596
in a way you'll be proud of.

222
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,399
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, gotta go.

223
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,069
l know that Sam
would not have wanted a big fuss,

224
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,438
but shouldn't we have
some sort of funeral for him?

225
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,434
Good Lord!

226
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,150
Amanda, l think we'd better
straighten this out. Sam!

227
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,393
- Sam, open the door. We have to talk.
- Has the freak show gone yet?

228
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,233
Oh, hi.
We haven't been introduced yet.

229
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,274
l'm Ed, Sam's twin brother.
l'm here to handle the estate.

230
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,635
Oh, boy.

231
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,712
Twin brother. What a trick, huh?

232
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
That's why he's the boss.

233
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,678
l can't believe you did this to me, Sam.

234
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,876
l'm sorry, Amanda.

235
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,033
l know it was stupid and cruel
and l could have handled it better.

236
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,512
l guess l could have pretended
to be sick for a few days first.

237
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,438
You don't have to apologise, Sam.

238
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,229
l do. l put you in a terrible spot.

239
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,710
Don't despair.

240
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,919
Just when my life seemed
to be its darkest,

241
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,596
l met Frasier Crane,
and learned love doesn't have to hurt.

242
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,877
Yeah, you can sleep right through it.

243
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,071
l made a lot of mistakes here, Sam.

244
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,836
And l have a history
of being wrong about men.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,879
But l know it's different
this time with you.

246
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,115
No matter what happens,
l'll never stop loving you.

247
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,831
Till the day l die, you'll always be mine.

248
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,678
This is going pretty well,
wouldn't you say?

249
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,354
Amanda, l didn't want to say this.

250
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,513
lt's something that will change
the way you feel about Sam.

251
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,069
Nothing you could ever say will change
the way l feel about him.

252
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,630
- Except this.
- Except nothing.

253
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,955
No matter what you ever do,
no matter where you ever go,

254
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,680
l'll never get over you.

255
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,472
Amanda, do you remember the man
l used to talk about in group therapy?

256
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,677
- Ralph?
- This is Ralph.

257
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,475
Sam is Ralph?

258
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,839
That's right. The man to whom you just
pledged your undying love is Ralph.

259
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,435
He can't hold me to that.

260
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,439
lf they won't let me sign contracts
or have a credit card or vote,

261
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,799
then l am not responsible for hysterical
hogwash that l babbled in a bar.

262
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,189
Thank you for saving me, Diane.

263
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,597
Sam, l will think of you

264
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,469
every time l see
something scurry under the sink.

265
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,669
l don't mean to seem ungrateful,

266
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,957
but what exactly did you say about me
in group therapy?

267
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,113
- l told them the truth.
- For instance?

268
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,396
l don't wanna get into this.

269
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,918
l made a lot of mistakes myself.
l was not a perfect girlfriend.

270
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,393
No, come on, l wanna know what lousy
things these people know about me.

271
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,313
- l told them about Christmas.
- That again?

272
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,596
What is wrong with giving steak knives?

273
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,514
My mother loved them. l give them
to you and l never hear the end of it.

274
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,277
Sam, l was your lover. You could have
given me something more personal.

275
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,798
What did you give me for Christmas?
A scarf. What's so personal about that?

276
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,635
l knit it myself.
And l had to take classes to learn how.

277
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,032
l sent away for the cashmere months
before just to get that particular grade.

278
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,715
l consulted a colourist to determine
the best colours for you

279
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,953
and l hand-dyed the fabric myself.

280
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:36,035
l would have made the steak knives
except l hocked my forge to buy the bar.

281
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,636
What else?

282
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,439
l told them about the time l had flu
and you didn't visit me once.

283
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,991
And you sent me second-hand flowers
for Valentine's Day.

284
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,869
- Well, l was nowhere near...
- You wanna hear this or not?

285
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,275
l told them about the time l cooked you
a seven-course dinner for your birthday

286
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,317
and you had a burger on the way over.

287
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,995
There was an explanation.
l just can't remember what it was.

288
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,436
And the time you lied
about a relative dying

289
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,149
so you could go skiing
and debauching with your buddies.

290
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,998
You still don't see the humour in that?

291
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,753
l wanted to spend the day with you
after our first night together

292
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,435
and you went to a football game.

293
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,068
lt wasn't a football game.

294
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,552
- The winners went to the play-offs.
- Oh, just forget it!

295
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,314
l'm sorry.

296
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,789
- What?
- l'm sorry.

297
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,075
l did the best l could
when l was with you.

298
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,954
You're right, l have blind spots
and l'm not a very good boyfriend,

299
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,032
but l never tried harder
with any woman in my life.

300
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,760
We had some bad times,

301
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,356
but the good times with you
were some of the best of my life.

302
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

303
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,071
- Diane, l...
- No, Sam, stop.

304
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,789
l want to get out of here before you say
something stupid that ruins it.

305
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,430
- No, no, now stop. Don't ruin it.
- l'm not gonna ruin it.

306
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,038
Yeah, that woulda ruined it.
Would it ever!

307
