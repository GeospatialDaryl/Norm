1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:04,185
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,454
Hey, Cliffy.
Oh, hey, Sam.

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:08,123
What are you doing
standing out in the rain?

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:09,257
Uh, it's good for the skin.

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:11,410
You know, negative ions.
Keeps it soft.

6
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,578
What'd you say
to Carla, Cliffy.

7
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:15,313
Called her a dwarf.

8
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,681
Oh.

9
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:17,982
Could you, uh, untie me, Sam?

10
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:19,451
Yeah, sure.

11
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,603
Thanks. Oh, whoa, whoa, wait
a second, wait a second.

12
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,171
How much more time
you got out here?

13
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:24,856
Uh, five minutes.

14
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,508
I'm sorry, buddy,
I can't do it.

15
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:28,510
She'd have me standing
right out here next to you.

16
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,578
I understand, Sam,
I understand.

17
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,579
No hard feelings.

18
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,713

Attention, everybody,
I have an announcement to make.

34
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,990
Thanksgiving is in a few days,
and I know that some of you

35
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,993
will not be able to spend it
with your families.

36
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,979
So, anybody who doesn't have
any place to go on Thanksgiving

37
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,414
is welcome to come
to my apartment.

38
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,199
I thought that would
be a nice gesture.

39
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,835
How'd you like to see
another nice gesture?

40
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:04,722
Carla Tortelli
graciously accepts.

41
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,925
How about you, Sam?

42
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:08,959
Yeah. I think it'd be fun

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,461
to go to Thanksgiving dinner
at your place.

44
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,546
Oh, great.

45
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,730
You know, I really think I can

46
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,065
put together a great
Thanksgiving dinner.

47
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,084
This'll be the second
one that I've cooked.

48
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,553
And believe me, the first one

49
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,522
was not the disaster that
my family said it was.

50
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:24,792
Those kids had a pretty
good time in that ambulance.

51
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:27,612
It was kind of
exciting for them.

52
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:30,081
I mean, at least it wasn't
the same old same old.

53
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,151
Oh, wait a second.

54
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,152
Did you say Thanksgiving?

55
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,486
Aw, shoot.

56
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,221
See, I usually spend
Thanksgiving

57
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,506
with my old Army buddies.

58
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,324
Sam, you weren't in the Army.

59
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:43,478
No, no, but, uh,
my buddies were.

60
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,515
You know, I-I'd invite
you all over to my place,

61
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:50,351
but Ma's down in Florida
working on her tan.

62
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,069
Yeah, she's got this
standing rule that, uh,

63
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,838
when she's not around,
I'm not allowed to bring

64
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,707
any more than two friends
over at a time.

65
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,059
Please, she's never gonna know.

66
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,912
Yes, she will, Norm.

67
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:02,880
Tell you what,
why-why don't we have

68
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,349
Thanksgiving dinner
here at Cheers?

69
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,650
Pot luck, huh?

70
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,184
Why here? Because you don't
think I can handle

71
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,804
the responsibility of making
a big dinner for everybody?

72
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:12,207
Well, I was gonna beat
around the bush a little bit,

73
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,598
but, yeah, that's the gist.

74
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,295
Well, if you're gonna have it,
can we have a turkey?

75
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,166
I was just gonna make
grilled cheese.

76
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,632
All right, we'll have a turkey.

77
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,766
Good idea.

78
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,401
Okay, who's in
on the dinner here, huh?

79
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:24,536
Count me in.
All right.

80
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,703
Fras, what about you?

81
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,372
Oh, you probably have
other plans, don't you?

82
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,958
Oh, yes, big plans.

83
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,576
Frederick and I will
be spending the day

84
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,813
with the new friends we've
made since Lilith's departure:

85
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,449
Mrs. Paul,
Dinty Moore,

86
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,118
Uncle Ben.

87
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:44,022
Oh, and maybe the
Stouffers will stop by.

88
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,623
Why don't you join us, huh?

89
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,025
Oh, thanks, Sam.

90
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,076
WOODY:
Oh, Mr. Gaines.

91
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,277
What a nice surprise.

92
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:52,313
You remember Mr. Peterson,
Mr. Clavin?

93
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,915
Nick. Clyde.

94
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,069
Actually, it's, uh,
it's Norm, Cliff.

95
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,271
You're lucky I got that close.

96
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:04,643
Now, Woody, the reason
I came by here is that

97
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,843
now that you're my son-in-law,

98
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,579
I need your signature
on some papers here.

99
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,830
So what are they?

100
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,965
Oh, it's, uh, nothing important.

101
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:13,334
Just, uh, some silly forms
giving me power of attorney

102
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:14,569
over all of your affairs.

103
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,388
You see, the Gaines estate

104
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,823
is wide and varied.

105
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,357
And now that you're
married to Kelly,

106
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,259
you're part of that estate.

107
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,679
I'm not sure I
understand all this.

108
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,749
Oh, let me put it
in Hanover-ese, Woody.

109
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,852
You know how a turkey, when,
uh, it feeds at the trough,

110
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:32,153
will eat until it dies?

111
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,938
Well,

112
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,289
these forms give me the right...

113
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,191
now that you're feeding
at the Gaines trough...

114
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,782
to pull your head away
if I think you're gonna choke.

115
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,815
Well, turkeys don't
choke, Mr. Gaines,

116
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,017
they explode.

117
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,285
Well, the one clue you get

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,221
is you-you hear this hissing
sound just before they blow.

119
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,341
Now, you hear a turkey hissing,

120
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,425
head for the hills.

121
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,296
Turkey shrapnel can kill you.

122
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,350
For God's sake,
Woody, just sign

123
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,019
or make your mark
or whatever it is you do.

124
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,058
Thank you, Woody.

125
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,160
Oh, wait, uh,
Mr. Gaines.

126
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,196
I just got paid today and, uh,

127
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,048
if I'm now part
of the Gaines estate,

128
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:20,935
I guess I should do my part and
throw my pay-check into the pot.

129
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,223
(chuckling)

130
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,310
Good, Woody.

131
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,279
Always leave them laughing.

132
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:35,850
Why do you let him talk
to you like that, huh?

133
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:36,901
NORM:
Yeah,

134
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,469
you got to stand
up to him, Wood.

135
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,789
I'd never let my father-in-law
take advantage of me that way.

136
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,523
CLIFF:
I, uh, thought

137
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,608
your father-in-law
was dead, Norm.

138
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,729
You know, he might be.

139
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:53,000
Haven't seen him in ages.

140
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,103
Come to think of it,
I do remember Vera left a note

141
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,105
on the refrigerator one night.

142
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,140
Something about a funeral.

143
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:02,927
Ah, shoot, this is
gonna drive me crazy.

144
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:06,865
You know, Sam, I always
wanted to get along

145
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,367
with Mr. Gaines like
I do with my dad.

146
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,002
You and your daddy
got along well, huh?

147
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,304
Oh, yeah. Oh.

148
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,007
We'd go fish and bowl,

149
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,042
hang around,

150
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,245
pass notes to each
other in class.

151
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:28,486
Woody, you know,
it's none of my business,

152
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,888
but I think you ought to stand
up to Mr. Gaines right now,

153
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,425
or he's gonna be walking all
over you the rest of your life.

154
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,076
Well, I'd like to
stand up to him, Sam,

155
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,045
but he scares me.

156
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,180
Well, I know.

157
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,364
He's a pretty intimidating guy.

158
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,366
But you know the way
around that is you figure out

159
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,202
what you're gonna say, get it
in your head all straight,

160
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,071
then you go over there
and you tell him.

161
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,824
Well, what would you say, Sam?

162
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,542
Me?

163
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:52,910
Oh. Well, I don't know.

164
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,347
Something like, uh, you know,
"I'm disappointed in you.

165
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,682
"You should be ashamed
of yourself, you know.

166
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,417
"Things are gonna be
different from now on.

167
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:02,888
You're gonna give me
the respect that I deserve."

168
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,791
Yeah, I always thought
I did respect you, Sam.

169
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,876
Maybe I was wrong.

170
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:09,644
Tell you what,
why-why don't we, uh,

171
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,496
why don't we drive over there
and-and you can rehearse

172
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,365
what you're gonna say
on the way, all right?

173
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,533
Well, I suppose if I don't,

174
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,901
I'll have to listen
to another lecture

175
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:19,404
about how I don't respect you.

176
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,639
Okay, okay, I'm 95% sure

177
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,175
Vera's father is alive.

178
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:25,209
No, no, dead.

179
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,160
No, make that dead.

180
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:27,912
He's dead.

181
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,748
Or could he be...

182
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,450
Well...

183
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,253
suppose I'll just call
Vera and ask her, I guess.

184
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:38,672
I don't know how you ask someone

185
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,423
(chuckles):
A question like that.

186
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,480
Although Vera is always saying
we should talk more, you know.

187
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,931
Uh, yes, hi, honey, hi.

188
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,336
Uh, listen, um, do I, uh,
do I have a dark suit?

189
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,438
I do? Um, good.

190
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,007
D-Do you remember,
uh, why I bought it?

191
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,743
A funeral, of course.

192
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,680
Was, uh, was your father there?

193
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,717
Was he wearing makeup
by any chance?

194
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,188
Vera? Vera?

195
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,625
Shoot, this is gonna
bug me all day.

196
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,179
(moans):
Oh, Walter.

197
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:20,581
Oh.
Oh!

198
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,216
(moaning):
Oh! Oh.

199
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,851
Katherine, Katherine,
we can't go on like this.

200
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:24,819
Walter...

201
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,080
You're my brother's wife.

202
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,639
I mean, if anyone
ever found out,

203
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,241
it would ruin both our families.

204
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,642
You're right,
Walter, it's wrong.

205
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:32,710
Terribly wrong.

206
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,314
But I don't care.
That's my girl.

207
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,334
Mr. Gaines is in the library,
right through there.

208
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,003
Aren't you gonna announce us?

209
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,272
Very well, sir.

210
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:47,408
Mr. Gaines, there are
two gentlemen here to see you.

211
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,194
That make you feel
like a big man?

212
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,098
Ah, don't worry about that.

213
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:57,001
Okay, just like we rehearsed
it in the car, big fellow.

214
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,119
All right,
I'm disappointed in him,

215
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,687
he should be ashamed of himself,

216
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:01,789
and he should start
treating me with respect.

217
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,790
Attaboy.

218
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,124
Yeah.

219
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,960
Mr. Gaines?

220
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,211
(moaning):
Oh, God.

221
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:08,379
Woody!

222
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,980
What are you doing here?

223
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,215
Oh, I-I can see you're busy.

224
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,633
I'll wait outside.

225
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,035
My God, Walter.

226
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,102
Who was that?

227
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:16,137
That was my idiot
son-in-law.

228
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,139
Woody, just a minute!

229
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,107
Well, did he see us?

230
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,407
Of course he saw us.

231
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:21,992
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

232
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:25,096
I've got to catch him before he
blabs it all over the mansion.

233
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,081
What do you mean
he's exercising?

234
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,152
That's what it looked like.

235
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:33,487
I-I think he was doing push-ups.

236
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,122
Oh, come on.

237
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:36,824
You're just trying
to back out of this.

238
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:38,676
No, I'm not, Sam.
I'm gonna tell him.

239
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,444
Well, then...
Excuse me.

240
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,481
You're the gentlemen I led
from the foyer to the library,

241
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:44,565
am I correct?

242
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,501
(chuckles):
Yeah, right.

243
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:50,238
Would you be a dear
and help me find my way back?

244
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,856
Uh, sure.

245
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,392
Well, actually, you know,
it's not that hard.

246
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,927
All you got to do is go down
the, uh, that staircase

247
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,547
with those naked angels
that are carved in the banister.

248
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:02,082
Then-then you, uh, go through
that long hallway

249
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:03,651
with the three naked ladies

250
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,320
kind of frolicking
in the field there.

251
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:08,990
And then you go take a left,
and you get in that big room

252
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,959
that has that, uh,
bronze statue of the b...

253
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:14,912
I'll tell you what, why don't
I take you there myself?

254
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,446
I'll be right back.

255
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,768
Now, Woody, I know you must
be terribly confused,

256
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:21,869
but there's
a simple explanation.

257
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,137
No, no, no,
Mr. Gaines.

258
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:24,789
You're gonna sit down,
and I'm gonna talk,

259
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,224
and you're
gonna listen. All right.

260
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,293
Now... I'm very
disappointed in you.

261
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,962
Ah.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

262
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,081
From now on, things are
gonna be different.

263
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:35,849
You're gonna start
treating me with respect.

264
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,834
Whatever you want, Woody.

265
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:37,935
What will it take for you

266
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,003
to forget everything
that's happened?

267
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,104
You name it.

268
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,305
Seriously?
Oh, yes.

269
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,008
Whatever you want.

270
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,553
Wow, that speech really took.

271
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,363
Well, uh, for starters,

272
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,895
this, uh, power of attorney
thing you made me sign.

273
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,484
It's gone, ripped up,

274
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,852
never existed.

275
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:57,287
All right, and I don't
want you to make fun of me

276
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,690
in front of my friends anymore.

277
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,957
You've got it.

278
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,342
Well, what I really want,
Mr. Gaines,

279
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:05,212
is just for us to get to know
each other better.

280
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:08,733
Oh, for God sakes, Woody,
I didn't commit murder.

281
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,351
All right, just forget
the whole thing.

282
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:12,803
Well, no, Woody,
if you want to be friends,

283
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,104
that's-that's fine,
that's fine.

284
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,040
In fact, uh,
we could, uh, oh...

285
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,107
Go fishing?

286
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,544
Yeah, uh, fishing.
Of course, fine.

287
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,895
In fact, why don't we go fishing
in your new boat?

288
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,180
(chuckles):
My new boat?!

289
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,248
Yes.

290
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,536
Really?
In-in fact, uh,

291
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,019
why don't we call it
the S.S. Silence?

292
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:32,456
Well, I'm sure
we can come up with

293
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:33,858
a better name than that,
but thanks.

294
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,125
Hooray.

295
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,310
(both chuckle)

296
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,912
You know, I get a
feeling we're gonna be

297
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,847
pretty close from
now on, Mr. Gaines.

298
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,686
Well, Walter...

299
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,421
did he know what we were doing?

300
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:50,140
Not only does he know,
but he's doing it to me.

301
00:11:55,725 --> 00:12:00,917
REBECCA: Okay, you guys, I'm
trying to get a head count here

302
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,919
so I know how many people
are here for Thanksgiving

303
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,455
so I can have enough turkey.

304
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,607
Oh, easy on the turkey
for me, though, Rebecca,

305
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,744
'cause, uh, those tryptophanes
just put me to sleep.

306
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,146
Get two turkeys.

307
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,716
Norm, are you gonna be here?

308
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:16,951
Yeah, I might as well.

309
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,121
Vera's spending Thanksgiving
at her mother's.

310
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:20,404
How come?

311
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:21,772
Oh, she's still angry
about me asking

312
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,674
whether her father's
dead or alive.

313
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,767
You never know what's going
to tick some people off.

314
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:30,814
Hey, Normie, I've got
an easy way to find out

315
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,016
whether or not your
father-in-law's,

316
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,467
uh, still alive or not.
Yeah?

317
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,420
Yeah, yeah, you give, uh,
Vera's parents' house a call.

318
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,722
If a guy answers,
bingo, there's your answer.

319
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:41,325
Huh? I'll tell you what.

320
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:43,744
I'll look up the number for you
in the directory here.

321
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:46,647
So what's, uh,
what's Vera's maiden name?

322
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,767
It's, uh...

323
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:54,005
Damn, this is gonna
get embarrassing.

324
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,908
Could I be having some
severe memory lapse here?

325
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,592
Oh, Norm, quick.

326
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,227
In Herbie The Love Bug, Yeah?

327
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,662
Who played the bad guy?

328
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:02,913
Keenan Wynn.

329
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,882
Your memory's sound, my friend.

330
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,323
WOODY:
Hey, Sam.

331
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,158
Me and Mr. Gaines
just went fishing

332
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:16,827
on my new boat.

333
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:19,096
And guess what we're
doing tomorrow?

334
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,831
Flying to Vermont.

335
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,550
Vermont?
Yeah.

336
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,151
Well, all I did
was ask Mr. Gaines

337
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,520
how maple syrup was made.

338
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,988
And the next thing
you know, boom,

339
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,890
he's firing up the jet.
That's right.

340
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,276
Well, in spite of all
the fun we've been having,

341
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:33,944
I, I really must run along.

342
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,813
Oh, hey, Mr. Gaines.

343
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,548
What about my hug?

344
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,717
Oh, gee, Woody, I don't know.

345
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,052
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

346
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,954
I don't want to catch one
of those fish hooks in my eye.

347
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,505
On second thought,
come here, son!

348
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,863
Wow. How 'bout that?

349
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,299
You guys are getting
along great, aren't you?

350
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,800
Yep, Sam.

351
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:00,304
You know, I owe it all
to my little speech.

352
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:03,674
As soon as I delivered it,
he was putty in my hands.

353
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,076
Well, that's great, man,
that's great.

354
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,145
Yeah.
I noticed, though, you said, uh,

355
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,016
your speech, when, you know,
technically it was my speech.

356
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:14,618
Remember? Right over there,
I, uh, thought it up.

357
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,654
You may have
thought it up, Sam,

358
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,689
but I'm the one
who made it sing.

359
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,426
Well, whatever.
Congratulations.

360
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,929
Yeah, you know,
when, uh, Woody Boyd talks,

361
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:28,131
people listen.

362
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,602
Matter of fact, Sam,

363
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:34,237
I'm gonna do you
a great, big favour.

364
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,843
Mr. Peterson, I'm gonna talk
and you're gonna listen.

365
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,744
It's about your beer tab.

366
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:43,897
Wood, stay in the shallow end.

367
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,857
Yeah, maybe you're right,
sorry.

368
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,269
Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it! Oh!

369
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,812
Oh, man, this is great.

370
00:14:58,846 --> 00:14:59,980
(TV clicks off)

371
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,348
Norm?
Yeah?

372
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,500
Th-The Barcalounger

373
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,902
is only here
for the day, right?

374
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:09,906
Thanksgiving just wouldn't
be the same without it, Sam.

375
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,809
Tomorrow it goes back, right?

376
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:14,445
I mean, you, you signed
this agreement remember?

377
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,965
Sam, what do you think
of all the decorations?

378
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:19,433
I bought everything
with my own money.

379
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:21,051
Yeah, you know,
I've been meaning to ask you.

380
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:24,122
What do skeletons and witches
have to do with Thanksgiving?

381
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,273
Well, uh...

382
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:30,744
the witches came over
with the Pilgrims.

383
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,748
And then the Pilgrims
burned them all at the stake.

384
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:37,551
And then, when they
were all burned up,

385
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:41,088
there was nothing left
of them but skeletons.

386
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:45,392
And that left the Pilgrims
free to make a big dinner.

387
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:49,763
They were cheap, huh?

388
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:53,117
Actually, they were
throwing them out.

389
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,585
Well, it looks, it looks
really nice, Rebecca.

390
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,137
It looks really nice.

391
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,139
Wh-What about the,
uh, the plates?

392
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,942
Oh, I'm going to borrow
those from Melville's.

393
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,659
No, no! Oh, don't do that.
Don't do that.

394
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,662
If-if John Hill finds out,
he'll blow his bald stack.

395
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,181
Oh, don't be silly.

396
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,749
Melville's is closed
and John Hill's at the Cape.

397
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,486
Besides, I'm already using his
oven to cook the turkey.

398
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:15,289
Well, in that case, uh, why
don't you get some silverware.

399
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,557
I think we've gonna run out
of these sporks.

400
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,095
Well, here we are, Frederick.

401
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,119
♪ Over the river
and through the woods ♪

402
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:25,933
♪ To the bar stool
on the right. ♪

403
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,903
Ah, the beginnings of a
marvellous Thanksgiving memory.

404
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:31,438
Say, Norm, uh, the last time
I was at your house,

405
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:33,007
wasn't this chair red?

406
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,299
Yeah, yeah, I go through
them pretty quickly.

407
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,446
Hi, Frasier.
Hi, Frederick. Hello.

408
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,016
Hey, how do you like the way
I decked the place out?

409
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,268
Well, uh, I must say it looks
rather... festive.

410
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,921
Thank you.
Oh, you're getting plates from Melville's.

411
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,440
You know what would look
beautiful is those, uh,

412
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,874
those gorgeous
candlesticks they have.

413
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,008
Ooh, good idea.

414
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,544
Why don't you go up there
and grab those?

415
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,412
Come here, Frederick.

416
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,714
Well, you guys lucked out.

417
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:00,150
You get to spend you
Thanksgiving with the Tortellis.

418
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,351
Hide your valuables.

419
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,706
Hey kids, park it over there.

420
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,175
Carla, why'd you only
bring three of your kids?

421
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:09,293
Well, we have this kind

422
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,195
of Thanksgiving
tradition at our home.

423
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,564
You see, at noon I set
them out on the curb.

424
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,248
Then the various men

425
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:17,384
they've come to know
as "Dad" drive by,

426
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,121
and who's ever left
comes with me.

427
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,693
Uh... there must
be some mistake here.

428
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:28,279
Uh... you've got me sitting
at the kiddie table.

429
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,917
Um, no, no,
uh, no mistake Cliff.

430
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,170
Uh, we all decided
that you're the only one

431
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:39,073
that we trust being
an adult supervisor.

432
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:42,776
Ah, well, that's another bowl
of stuffing, then, Sammy.

433
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:44,746
I'll be proud to watch
the little tykes.

434
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:48,082
So, kiddies...

435
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,617
I ever tell you about
the first Thanksgiving?

436
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:54,020
Yeah, it took place, uh,
between the ancient Egyptians

437
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:57,324
and astronauts
from a distant galaxy.

438
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,162
(speaking gibberish)

439
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,063
Oh, thank you, Frederick.

440
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,534
God, I wish I'd had kids.

441
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:16,610
Food's on!
Come on, everybody.

442
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:20,280
Hey.
Sit down around the table here.

443
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,831
Listen, here's the good news.

444
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:23,917
You can make a mess,
and don't worry about

445
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:26,220
breaking anything, 'cause none
of this stuff belongs to us.

446
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,589
Yay!
Yay! Yay!

447
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:31,425
Sam why don't you, uh,
make a little toast?

448
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,926
Oh... yeah.

449
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:34,395
All right, that's a good idea.

450
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,030
Uh, all right, uh...

451
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:40,000
welcome to, uh,
Thanksgiving at Cheers.

452
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,784
I hope everybody
enjoys the food,

453
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:45,339
and I'd like to make
a toast right now

454
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:49,410
to the man who made this all
possible: John Allen Hill.

455
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:50,944
Oh, now, now, come on.

456
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,012
I-I know what
you're thinking.

457
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:54,147
But you know,
I tell you the truth

458
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,717
uh, if John and I hadn't gotten
off on the wrong foot

459
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,402
I think we would have
been best of friends.

460
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,471
If he were here right now,
I would, uh,

461
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,439
I'd ask him to sit down
and break bread with us.

462
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,041
But because he isn't, then I say
let's raise our glasses

463
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,978
to that grand old gentleman,
John Allen Hill.

464
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,198
Cheers.
JOHN: Well, isn't this touching?

465
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,283
All the Who's down in Whoville

466
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,453
gathered 'round
their roast beast.

467
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,957
Good heavens, man, I thought
you were at the Cape.

468
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,975
I was until the police
called to tell me

469
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:24,644
the silent alarm
had gone off upstairs.

470
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,297
Ah, uh, yeah- that was,
that was us, John.

471
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,749
I-I'm sorry, we, uh,

472
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:31,551
borrowed a few things
for our simple dinner here.

473
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:32,769
John, I'll tell you what.

474
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,004
Why don't you join us, please?

475
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,138
Please come sit
at my right hand.

476
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,806
No, no, no, thank you.
Please, I couldn't.

477
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,109
But since no harm was done,
I'll be on my way.

478
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,310
Happy Thanksgiving.

479
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,679
And do sterilize everything.

480
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,584
Thank you, John,
and happy Thanksgiving.

481
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:52,323
So how'd you spot him?

482
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,842
I saw the reflection of his head
in the dessert tray.

483
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:55,976
Can I have one?

484
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,168
Mr. and Mrs. Woody Boyd.

485
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:08,455
How was that, sport?

486
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,292
Hi, Daddy.

487
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,626
Hello, pumpkin.

488
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,527
It's good to see you.

489
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,679
Hi, Dad.

490
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,763
Hello, son.

491
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:20,234
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving!

492
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:22,069
Hi, Uncle Richard,
Aunt Katherine.

493
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,336
Hello, darling.
GAINES: Richard.

494
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:24,437
Walter.

495
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,022
Woody.

496
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,725
Certain parties are
here this evening,

497
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,460
and things may
get very delicate.

498
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,328
Oh, don't worry
about a thing, Mr. Gaines.

499
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,196
Boy, she looks familiar.

500
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,682
Now, Woody...

501
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:37,884
Where have I seen her before?

502
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:39,636
WOODY: Help me out
here, Mr. Gaines.

503
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,154
I got it!

504
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:43,090
Uh, everyone
into the dining room.

505
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:44,959
I can smell that turkey,
it's all ready.

506
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,193
Let's just move along now.

507
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,262
The cranberry sauce
and stuffing,

508
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,296
all the trimmings.

509
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:50,497
Let's just move right along.

510
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,999
Come on,
move, move, move, move.

511
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,233
Save me a drumstick.

512
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:56,886
Woody, I thought
we had an understanding.

513
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,971
Now, we went fishing,
took you bowling,

514
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:01,207
we went to the arcade-
if there's a lower middle class

515
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,042
activity in Boston,
we've done it.

516
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,913
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gaines.

517
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:08,648
I was just trying
to figure out where I knew

518
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,818
Kelly's aunt from,
and it finally came to me.

519
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,185
Of course it came to you.
You caught me

520
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,038
making love to her
on the floor of my office.

521
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,389
I met her at the wedding.

522
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:17,891
Caught you what?
Nothing.

523
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:19,860
Let's eat.

524
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,029
Holy cow,
that's your brother's wife,

525
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,496
and you're having
an affair with her?

526
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:25,299
Yes.

527
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,267
You really didn't know?
No.

528
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:29,169
Then you're not
blackmailing me?

529
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:31,004
I didn't have to buy
your silence?

530
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,740
Well, no, I-I would never
blackmail you, Mr. Gaines.

531
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:36,243
I mean, I think what you're
doing is disgusting and wrong,

532
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,934
but that's between
you and Satan.

533
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:41,164
I've got something to tell you.

534
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,433
I think that we can't
be friends anymore.

535
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,601
I don't respect you.

536
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:46,653
Well, I'll just have to live

537
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:48,456
with your scorn
and contempt, Woody.

538
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,240
Okay, Mr. Gaines.

539
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,474
I just want you to know,

540
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,777
I'd never blackmail you.

541
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,527
I'd much rather do this.

542
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:56,429
Hey, everybody, I've got
something to tell you! Uh...

543
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,931
I want the wishbone!

544
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:00,868
Gotcha.

545
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,905
This is gonna be a fun night.

546
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,959
Dear God...

547
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,761
It's over.

548
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:14,898
I'm free, finally free.

549
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,534
Your brother's wife, eh, Wally?

550
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,105
Get me a drink.

551
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,407
We have to talk.
