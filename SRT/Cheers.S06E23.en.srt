Let's get him!                  

603
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,305
        ( <i>all shouting</i> )        

604
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:25,932
         ( <i>shouting</i> )           

605
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,467
            ( <i>Carla laughing</i> )  

606
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,170
            Whoo-hoo!           

607
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:32,972
     Man, that guy was          
 a lot quicker than he looked.  

608
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,073
            Yeah. Let's, uh,    

609
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,942
            check out this      
            guy's wallet.       

610
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:38,478
            Find out who this   
            joker really was.   

611
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:39,580
                 Yeah, this, uh,

612
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,349
             this guy's name    
             was... Wade Boggs. 

613
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:46,219
             Wait.              
                    Wow, what a 
                    coincidence.

614
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,171
         Well, I guess Gary went
         to a lot of trouble    

615
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,873
         to make up fake I.D.'s 
         for this guy and...    

616
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:52,042
             credit cards and...

617
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:55,045
     photo of him with          
     Jim Rice and Dwight Evans. 

618
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,748
( <i>groans</i> )                      

619
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,216
 Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, guys.  

620
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,450
     I had a rough night.       

621
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,352
     I was out showing          
     Gary's steady chick        

622
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:03,519
     the time of her life.      

623
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:04,554
         ( <i>laughing</i> )           

624
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,373
                         Whoo.  

625
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,291
     Did I miss anything?       

626
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,993
No, no, just an average day.    

627
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,862
We refilled the pretzel bowls,  

628
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,665
played a little darts,          
pantsed Wade Boggs,             

629
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,750
watched a little TV.            
            Wait, you did what? 

630
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:19,936
Oh, man, we thought it was      
another one of Gary's tricks.   

631
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,072
             So that's who was  
             running out there  

632
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:24,074
    in his underwear in traffic.

633
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,742
            You know, you see...

634
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,511
     Gary has pulled off        
         the greatest,          

635
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:29,279
         most ingenious         
     trick of them all.         

636
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,215
He's gotten us to get ourselves.

637
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,432
CLIFF:                          
Frasier's right.                

638
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,067
We can't top this.              

639
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,668
Gary's beaten us.               

640
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:38,004
     You know, it's really      
     rather Machiavellian.      

641
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:39,456
                            Hey.

642
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,342
    Come on, guys.              

643
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,861
    So we've been humiliated    
    in every sport.             

644
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:46,179
     We've still got something  

645
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:47,748
     that Gary can't take away. 

646
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,983
                     Our pride? 

647
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:52,652
    Hell, no.                   
    We never had that.          

648
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,771
    We have got                 

649
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:57,540
             the great          
             Wade Boggs' pants! 

650
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,828
             Well, it's either  
             this or nothing.   

651
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,517
    We're number one!           

652
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,486
             ALL:               
     We're number one!          

653
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,488
     We're number one!          

654
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,789
     We're number one!          

655
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,357
             We're number one!  

656
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,692
             Hey!               
     We're number one!          

657
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,228
         Pretty weenie.         

658
