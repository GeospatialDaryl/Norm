          Try-try under the bed.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,200
                Well, if they're
                not there,      

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,700
                look in the back
                of the closet,  

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,400
                or behind the   
                dresser,        

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,700
            or in the washing   
            machine.            

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,600
        Yeah, if-if you still   
        can't find them,        

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,900
                call me back.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,300
                 I swear to God,

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,600
                  that man would
                  lose his head 

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,000
                if it weren't   
                bolted on.      

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
What's, uh...                   
what's up there, Carla?

                  Eddie wants to
                  take the twins
                  for a walk.   

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,100
Uh, can't find his shoes, huh?  

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,200
                 No, he can't   
                 find the twins.

Oh. Excuse me.                  

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
    No, no, it was my fault.    

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,500
    I'm sorry.                  

36
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
    Are you okay?               

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,800
         I'm just fine.         

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
    But how nice of you to be   
    so completely concerned.    

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,700
Well, you know, you can't be    
too careful these days.

00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,900
                    Yeah.

when's your baby due?           

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,300
    I'm not pregnant.           

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Oh. Well, then                  
I really am sorry.              

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,900
    Excuse me.                  

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,600
 Well, why don't you just watch 
    where you're going then

      next time, Buster?!

Sam,                            

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
does this outfit                
make me look                    

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
like I've put on                
a little weight?                

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,700
                The outfit?     
                Uh, yeah, no.   

51
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,900
                     That's what
                     it must be.

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,000
                    Right, yeah.

53
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,200
                    Turn around.
                    Let me see. 

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
                Yeah, blame it  
                on the outfit...

55
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,400
You know, you've been wearing   
an awful lot                    

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,900
of fat clothes recently,        
haven't you?                    

57
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
                Oh, just shut   
                up, butthead.   

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
She called me a butthead.       

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
     I think I'm gonna cry.     

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,500
                     Oh, don't  
                     worry, Sam.

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
              It only looks that
              way from the back.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,500
Want another beer, Mr. P.?      

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
             Love to, Woody, but

64
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,200
             I got to get back  
             to painting Frasier
             and Lilith's place.

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,100
     This is the first job      
    anyone's given me           

66
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,000
     in, like, four months,     
so I'm not going to do anything 

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
    to jeopardize it.           

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
  I'm really making an effort   
        this time               

69
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,800
         to be the kind         
of dependable professional      

70
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,300
         that I'd like          
    to have working for me.     

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
     See you, Mr. Peterson.     

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
          What, Wood?           

73
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,300
     I said, I'll see you.      

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
     Well, damn it, Woody.      

75
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
Now you made me late, man.      

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,600
All right, as long as I'm late, 

77
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
I'll just have another beer,    
I guess.                        

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,100
                    Oh, much    
                    better.     

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,400
                    Yes, much   
                    better, yes.

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,500
You know, I never thought       

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
our wedding portrait            
lived there.                    

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,300
Um, where should it go, Ivan?   

83
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,000
         Here's a spot.         

84
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,500
                    Perfect.    

85
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
              Why clutter a home
              with mementos?    

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,200
Did I tell you last night       

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,500
      I programmed myself       
to dream about your space?      

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
                     You didn't.

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
                 We're thrilled.

90
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
              Hmm.              

91
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,000
         To begin with,         
    we lose this wall.          

92
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,000
Uh, by lose,                    
do you mean                     

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
    we redesign it so that it   
    practically disappears,     

94
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,700
or lose, we knock it down       

95
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,900
so that we're left              
facing the back of our stove?   

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,600
                Hmm... fret not.

97
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,700
We'll be transforming <i>il cucina</i> 
        <i>into an atrium.</i>         

98
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,700
I love this idea.               

99
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,300
    I adore it.                 

100
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,200
     But what about eating?     

101
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,400
     I design, I don't eat.     

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,300
    Now, over here I imagine    
      removing the ceiling      

103
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,800
and extending the wall up       
      to the second story,      

104
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,600
culminating in a skylight       
    to flood the room           

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,300
with natural illumination.      

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,600
But, uh...                      

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,200
that's our...                   
that's our bedroom up there.    

108
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,700
          Is that all           
    you people think about,     

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,400
      eating and sleeping?      

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,700
    Tell me this was a gift.    

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
  Doctor, might I have a word   
        with you?               

112
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,200
    Certainly, Doctor.          

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,900
                 How do you feel
                 about Ivan?    

114
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,600
Feel? Look,                     

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,700
the man is one of the most      
famous designers in the city.   

116
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
He's been written up            
in every magazine               

117
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,000
from <i>Metropolitan Home</i> to <i>HG.</i>   

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
He's got more awards            
on his shelves                  

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
than we have shelves.           

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,700
I'd like to beat the crap       
out of him.                     

121
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,200
                 Maybe we should
                 let him go.    

122
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,600
If that's your final decision,  
my cherub, I concur.            

123
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
                The heave-ho.   

124
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,900
             Wait.              

125
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
                At the risk of  
                sounding sexist,

126
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
            I do believe this   
            is man's work.      

127
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
                    It requires 
                    a firm hand.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
    Please feel free to leave   
    the room if you must.       

129
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
                  This could get
                  unpleasant.   

130
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,900
              Sir.              

131
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,400
    You're too good for us.     

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,500
        Your masterful design   

133
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,800
             would make our poor
             little lives       

134
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
                  just seem drab
                  by comparison,

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
and of course,                  
we'll, uh,                      

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
        see to your severance   
        pay, two weeks?         

137
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,700
                     Six months?

138
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,800
IVAN:                           
Fine.                           

139
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,000
        I can't tell you        
what a once-in-a-lifetime thrill

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
    it's been to bask           
        in your talent.         

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,700
        Uh, bye-bye now.        

142
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,300
        Watch the steps.        

143
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,400
                    Huh.        

144
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,400
I only hope he can recover      
from that tongue lashing.       

145
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
So, dandelion,                  

146
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,400
now that you've given away      
    the farm to Ivan,           

147
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,400
        do you have some        
Swiss bank account we can empty 

148
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,900
to pay another decorator?       

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,000
 Well, I'll go that one better, 
        Dove bar.               

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
            I submit            
  that between the two of us,   

151
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,700
      we have enough taste      
        and intelligence        

152
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,500
                 to redesign our
                 own habitat,   

153
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,700
              <i>sans</i> outside help.

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,900
Bite me, I love you.            

155
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
      I take back my bite.      

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
            We suck.            

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
          Much better.          

158
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Much better!                    

159
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
        Pardon me?              

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,900
         Yes, by simply         
    moving that chair,          

161
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,600
 an intimate conversation area  
          is created,           

162
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,600
  at the same time, opening up  
     a new traffic pattern      

163
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,300
that gives the entire room      

164
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,000
             a whole new dynamic
             sense of flow.     

165
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,300
Plus, I can spackle behind here.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
        Of course, if...        

167
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
if you really want a better shot
     at the intimate thing,     

168
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,700
I'd, uh, take these, uh--       

169
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,900
     what do you call it--      
 these Louis Couture's jobbies, 

170
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,700
uh, and move them over like so. 

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,700
                Get the table...
                over this way.  

172
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
                    Okay.       

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,900
        Now, this table         
    would have to come          

174
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,100
        like yea.               

175
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,300
             Right?             

176
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,600
            And, uh,            

177
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
sofa could come around          
this way.                       

178
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,500
Of course.                      

179
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,300
Okay?                           

180
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
Now, uh,                        

181
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,900
 that desk has got to come out  
  of there, you put the piano   

182
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,600
into the bay,                   
all right?                      

183
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,300
     That chrome and glass,     
    you put into the harbor.    

184
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Uh...                           

185
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
        I tell you what.        

186
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
          I'd-I-d move          
into the warm tones, all right? 

187
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
     Reupholster, redrape,      
     the whole damn thing.      

188
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,400
      Splash a little bit       
      of paisley around.        

189
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
Throw down a nice               

190
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,100
                    Bukhara rug.

191
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,900
  Top it off with a fine piece  
     or two of chinoiserie,     

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
        and we're there.        

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
      Well, bite us, Norm,      
          we love you.          

194
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,000
                So, uh, what    
                do you got in   
                there, Woodski? 

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,900
            Oh, boy.            

196
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,200
        My Aunt Edna's killer   
        fudge brownies.         

197
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,200
Ooh, killers, huh?              

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
             Yeah, they're      
             called that because
             the first time     

199
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,400
            my Uncle Ford ever  
            smelled them baking,

200
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,400
        he came running in      
        from the field and      
        got hit by a combine.   

201
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
                  He hung on for
                  a few days.   

202
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,000
            At the end, he was  
            just praying to die.

203
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
                Well, eat up,   
                everybody.      

204
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
         Hi, everybody.         

205
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,800
    Oh, hey, Rebecca.           

206
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,300
        Want a brownie?         

207
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,600
                  Oh, I'm sorry,
                  I forgot.     

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,900
      Moment on the lips,       
    a lifetime on the hips.     

209
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,100
                    CLIFF:      
                    You know,   
                    Rebecca,    

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know why you're so, uh, 
  concerned about your figure.  

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,300
         You know, back         

212
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,600
              in the Renaissance
              time, uh,         

213
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,800
    full-figured women          
         were revered.          

214
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,800
                        Get out.

215
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,800
        It's true.              

216
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,800
                        Yeah?   

217
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
          Yeah, yeah.           

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,700
 Artists would only paint big,  
    voluptuous women.           

219
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,200
In fact, that's how they got rid
  of a lot of their old paint.  

220
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,700
                You know,       
                speaking        

221
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,800
                of, uh, weight  
                and stuff,      

222
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,100
                    I got       
                    a riddle.   

223
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
            Which is heavier,   

224
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,300
                a pound of      
                Cliff's brain   

225
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,800
                or a pound of   
                dead flies?     

226
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,400
     It's a trick question.     

227
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
      A pound is a pound.       

228
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,700
They both weigh the same.       

229
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,700
    Go ahead, ask me another    
of Mr. Clavin's brain questions.

230
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
                Okay, let's see.

231
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,900
            Uh..                
            ( <i>clears throat</i> )   

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
                  if you dropped
                  Cliff's brain 

233
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,100
              and a bowling ball
              off the top       

234
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
            of the Empire       
            State Building...   

235
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Yeah? Yeah?                     

236
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,600
                    Well...     

237
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,700
Norm, we had to rush over       
to tell you.                    

238
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
      The new window treatment  
      you designed just went up.

239
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,000
    It is spectacular.          

240
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,400
        Are you speaking        
        to another Norm,        

241
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,300
  or do you have a death wish?  

242
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
        Beg your pardon?        

243
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Come on, come on.               

244
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,600
 You think I want these people  
            to know             

245
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm an interior decorator?      

246
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,700
              We're sorry, Norm.

247
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
            It's just, we simply
            cannot moderate     
            our approbation.    

248
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,100
     Well, give it a shot,      
     okay?                      

249
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,800
                 But you should 
                 be decorating  
                 professionally.

250
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
        Oh, no, no, no.         
        Please.                 

251
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,500
    Doing you folks a favor     
         was one thing.         

252
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
            Any more            
of this interior decorating junk

253
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,700
        could really eat        
    into my reputation          

254
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,600
 as a lazy, beer-guzzling lump  
      of mashed potatoes.       

255
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,000
  But, Norm, you have a gift.   

256
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,300
             Gift?              

257
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,600
        Try curse, pal.         

258
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,800
  I spent my whole damn life    
  trying to cover up the fact   

259
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,300
that I have a great sense       
        of color,               

260
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,500
    and I always know           
  where to stick the ottoman.   

261
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,800
        Oh, it's a pity.        

262
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,300
    You see, we've just met     
        this new couple,        

263
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,700
and they-they need a decorator. 

264
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,000
     Dearest, Norm has made     
      his feelings clear.       

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
Yes, but they're                
very well off.                  

266
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,700
              Frasier, it's not 
              a matter of money.

267
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,100
They're willing                 
to pay five figures.            

268
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,200
                 But, Frasier...

269
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,000
     Hey, Elvira, back off.     

270
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,300
                If the left side
                of Cliff's brain
                leaves New York 

271
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,000
        on a train traveling    
        at 65 miles per hour,   

272
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
              and the right side
              of Cliff's brain  
              leaves L.A. on... 

273
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,100
Wait, wait, wait.               

274
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,500
Let me get a pencil.            

275
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
             Yeah!              

276
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,700
        Damn, I am good.        

277
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,700
     Bring these people on.     

278
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,900
     I'll wipe up the floor     
        with them.              

279
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,000
     Who are they, anyhow?      

280
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,700
Well, actually, they're friends 
          of friends.           

281
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,900
NORM:                           
Yeah?                           

282
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,800
But I have to warn you-- they're
the essence of the Y word.      

283
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,100
     That's the yuppie word     
          for yuppie.           

284
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,200
                        NORM:   
                        Oh.     

285
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,200
        Are you implying        
    that I'm a yuppie?          

286
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,800
    Oh, forgive me, I erred.    

287
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,500
     If I ever do it again,     

288
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,000
you may cut out my tongue       
and serve it to me in a fajita.

290
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
Yup, here we go.                
                    Uh-huh.     

291
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm going to take one last look 
        in the kitchen.         

292
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
            Hi, we were just    
              talking about you!

    Yes, yes.                   

295
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
        Sorry we're late.       

296
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
            We couldn't decide  

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,700
        whether to take         
     the Range Rover or the BMW.

298
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
            Oh but don't keep   
            us in suspense.     

299

     The Beamer.                

300
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,500
Well, we're all here now--      
what fun.                       

301
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,400
  Uh, Kier Royales all around?  

302
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,100
                Super.          
                    That'd be   
                    great, Fras.

303
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
        I can't get over        
      what your decorator       

304
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,600
has done with this place.       

305
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,800
     It's warm, it's solid.     

306
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
    It's real.                  
                     It's super.

307
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,100
    Oh, hi, what's going on?    

308

             Hi...              

309
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,500
Kim and Robert Cooperman,       
I'd like you to meet            

310
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,300
our decorator,                  
Norman Peterson.                
                             Hi.

311
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
KIM:                            
How do you do, Norman?          
                  Great.        

312
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,500
        You know,               
  this is the last cold beer.   

313
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,200
We could split it or something? 

314
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,900
          No, thanks,           
      we're taken care of.      

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,700
Okay, well, suit yourself, huh? 

316
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Sit down everybody.             

317
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,500
It's beautiful and functional.  

318
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,300
         You know, uh,          
        Frasier told me         

319
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
            a little bit        
            about your place,   

320
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,600
            so I did take the   
                liberty of, uh, 

321
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,800
                    jotting down
                    a few ideas.

322
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
                Uh... excuse me.

323
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,500
Are those cocktail napkins?     

324
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,000
    Yeah, I'm sorry,            
    did you need one?           

325
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,400
          No.                   

326
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Veggie pâté?                    

327
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,700
  Oh, yes, yes, please.         

328
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,100
 I'm on empty over here.        

329
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,300
      Anyway...                 

330
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,100
    I heard your place          
  is pretty modern, you know?   

331
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,800
     And most of your stuff     
        is kind of gray.        

332
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,300
 So I thought, maybe, you know, 

333
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,900
        some, you know,         
      color would be good.      

334
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
         Uh, actually, we hadn't
         totally sold ourselves 

335
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
    on the concept of change.   

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
NORM:                           
Oh.                             

337
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
             You could keep, uh,

338
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,700
    some of your old stuff,     
         and, you know,         

339
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
 throw in some new stuff, too.  

340
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
             Um...              

341
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
    Fras, uh, could you, uh,    

342
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,100
      help me with              
  this wall treatment?

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,800
I rolled it myself.             

345
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,600
                What's going on?

346
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
            I'm dying over here.

347
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700

it's them.                      
                      Yeah?

350
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,300
well, their chefs be French,    
you know,                       

351
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
that their mechanics be German, 
and that their designers be...  

352
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,200
      ...stylish.

354
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,700
              You mean, stylish.

          Listen, uh,           

363
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,600
    did I tell you that, uh,    

364
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,500
last night, I programmed myself 

365
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,800
 to dream about your... space?  

366
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,900
             Miss Howe, I don't 
             mean to insult you,

367
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,100
              but you're looking
              kind of puny.     

368
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,200
        Have you lost weight?   

369
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,200
Is this a setup?                

370
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Did Sam tell you to say that?   

371
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,800
            No, ma'am, I told   
            myself to say it.   

372
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,300
            Yeah, I'm worried   
            about you, you know?

373
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
If you're not careful, you're   
going to start wasting away,    

374
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,100
        and pretty soon your    
        ribs will start to show,

375
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,000
         like this guy back in  
         Hanover, Kyle Lefferts.

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,300
                Of course, he'd 
                been dead awhile

377
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,000
            when they found him.

378
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Thank you, Woody.               

379
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,800
That's the nicest thing         
anyone's said to me all week.   

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,700
        Your hair's been looking
        kind of ratty, too.     

381
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Unfortunately,                  
that's the second nicest thing. 

382
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,800
             What, no kiss?     

383
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
        No, I've got            
        to weigh myself.        

384
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,700
Oh, we got your scale back here.

385
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,200
What's it doing behind the bar? 

386
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,700
          We needed it          
     to settle an argument      

387
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,900
         about how much         
Mr. Clavin's brain weighs.      

388
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,900
            I think I am in for 
            a pleasant surprise.

389
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,500
             SCALE:             
Your weight is 162 pounds.      

390
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,300
                  ( laughs )    
             What?!

        Have a nice day.        

392

Malone!                         

393
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,500
                Get out here!   

394
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I know what you just did!       

395
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,700
     Congratulations.           

396
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,700
                  Not you, I was
                  talking to... 

397

          Okay, okay, look.     

399

is found murdered in a room.    

400

Good, he's here.                

402

Hello, Norman!                  

403

404

            Oh, hi.             

405

          No, no, no, let's,    
          uh, let's sit up here.

406

                 Um, well, Dick 
                 and, uh, Tracy.

407
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,400
                How did you ever
                track me down?  

408
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,300
It's the address                
on the cocktail napkin          

409
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,700
you did your sketches on.

             You know, Norman,  
              we've never been  

412
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,500
in a gay bar before.            

413
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,800
             Yeah.              
It seems                        

414
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
    just like a regular bar.    

415
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,700
Oh, honey.                      

416
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Look at those two.              

417
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Anyway, how about some drinks?  

418
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
All right. Miss?                

419
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,100

I'll take care of it.

 my friends and I need a couple 
  of, uh, white wine spritzers  

423

     pop in here on a whim.

        on our place so much

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,600
Pleased to meet you.            

486
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,100
      You sure do               
  make a cute couple.           

487
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,700
          Just accept           
     the compliment, honey.     

488
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,700
                    Thanks.     

489
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
             I have a confession
             to make.           

490
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,300
         We came in here tonight

491
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,900
            to try to fix Norman
            up with another man.

492
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,400
  Naughty, naughty.             

493
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,200
            Naughty, naughty.   

494
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,300
But since the two of you        
are together,                   

495
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,700
        how about if the        
        four of us spend the    
        weekend at the cabin?   

496
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,900
                It'll be a hoot!

497
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Is that good for you, Sam?      

498
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,300
              What do you mean  
              is it good for me?

499
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,600
          It stinks for me, man.

500
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,400
            Come on, I can't.   

501
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
            I can't hack this.  
            Don't do this to me.

502
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,300
                  Listen,       
                  I like babe...

503
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,100
              I <i>love</i> babes,     
              and babes love me.

504
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,200
                    Babes.

                    Babes.      

507

             Babes.             

508
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,700
         "Babes" is his pet word
         for linebackers.       

509
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,500
          Norman, I pride myself

510
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
              on being a very   
              perceptive person.

511
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
        Now, is something amiss?

512
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,500
             Yeah.              

513
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
      Sam and I have had a tiff.

514
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,100
    Look.                       

515
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,100
Maybe meeting Michael           
is just the thing you need.     

516
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
I mean, he lives                
right around the corner.        

517
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,800
Kim, go call him.

             No. No-no-no-no-no,
             folks, please.     

519
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
              I can't go on with
              this any longer.  

520
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,600
        Look, I don't care if   
        it costs me the job.    

521
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,300
            I got to tell you   
            the truth, okay?    

522
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
                 I wanted to be 
                 your decorator,

523
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,400
    so I pretended to be who I  
    thought you wanted me to be,

524
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,300
         but... it's time that I
         came out of the closet.

525
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,600
                I'm straight.

528
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,200
            Ever since I        
            was a little boy,   

529
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
              I've known that   
              I preferred girls.

530
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
                Actually, I'm a 
                guy with a wife.

531
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,500
                I mean, uh, I   
                sleep with Vera.

532
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
        Well, you know,         
      I sleep next to her.      

533
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,200
Actually, it's in the room      
          next to her,          

534
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
            but, uh,            
    I do keep the door open.

  But the point is, you know,   

536
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,700
I think you should judge people 
    for what they do,           

537
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,000
        not for...

  we've been the perpetrators

        of this kind of

545

people of principle, all right?

And we put our trust in you,    
our faith.

We trusted you with our most    
prized possession, our home.

And how did you                 
return that trust?

you betrayed us.

You made fools of us.
