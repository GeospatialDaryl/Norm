00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,237
REBOUND (PART 2 )

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,153
That's it, folks. Closing it up.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,437
- Night, Coach.
- Good night, guys.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,310
- Normie, you want to get a bite to eat?
- l have a wife at home.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,553
We could stop by and pick her up.
l haven't met her yet.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,109
l don't think so. Not tonight.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,999
Wait a minute.
Are you ashamed of me or her?

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,116
A little of both, l guess.

9
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,116
Hey, everybody. l'm back.

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,635
Last week on Cheers,
l, Cliff Clavin,

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,109
postman and happy wanderer,

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,750
returned from a vacation
in the state of Florida.

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,388
lt was an invigorating experience.

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,350
l'd tell you about it but certain parties
insist l fill you in on the story.

15
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,035
Diane and Sam had
a little falling by the wayside.

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,317
They went separate ways,
Sam went back to his old ones.

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,349
l don't know which wagon Sam fell off,
but back to the bottle he went.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,035
Diane went what
we euphemistically call...

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,628
and spent time in a country hospital.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,238
After she got out, Coach got her into
Cheers to try and talk sense into Sam.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,756
She talked him into
seeing a psychiatrist.

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,118
Sam agreed, not knowing that the shrink
and Diane were dating steadily,

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,635
and rumour has it, heavily.

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,920
Sam is under a misconception
that Diane still carries the torch for him.

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,039
Diane thinks that Sam
is the torch bearer.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,830
You know something?
l may have the wrong batch of slides.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,835
These are my snaps of FLA.
You all know how Sam and Diane look.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,595
But a lot of you haven't
seen The Sunshine State.

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,796
What we're looking at here is...

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,799
All right, who pulled the plug?
Very funny. Come on!

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,437
You're a failure and you're gutless
because you won't admit it.

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,637
You've hurt everyone
who's tried to reach you.

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,473
You make me sick!

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,917
Sam, tell me what's on your mind.

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,119
- How much this will cost.
- You're thinking of money?

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,718
Yeah, l hope it's not going to be a lot
because l get Diane to do this for free.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,478
She used to abuse me
for free all the time.

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,995
Well, it wasn't exactly free.
l had to sleep with her.

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,631
Beneath your flippancy l sense
a lot of hostility towards Diane.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,189
And towards myself.

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,148
Look, l haven't had a drink in ten days.

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,836
l've got a problem, but l'm going to AA
and l think l'm going be OK.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,391
No, you're better than OK, Sam.
You're abundantly human.

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,431
You said l made you sick.

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,637
l was confronting you.
Forget about that.

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,758
l am telling you that
you're abundantly human.

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,072
Great, l really think l'm going
be able to handle this.

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,196
l don't.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,956
- l'm abundantly human, remember?
- Don't you see?

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,237
l'm putting you
on an emotional pendulum.

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,109
l don't want to be on anything.
l want to quit.

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,236
- What?
- This is distressing.

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,632
- l hear Sam ''the failure''.
- You said l was abundantly human.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,712
An abundantly human person
can change.

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,953
- l want to quit, that's a change.
- You're becoming compulsive.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,317
- We should double our sessions.
- Double? Come on!

57
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,278
- l'll be OK.
- You have progressed.

58
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,672
- Good, let's quit.
- Sam! There's that word again.

59
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,834
Do you realise that you keep saying it?
Could you stop if you wanted to?

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,036
Frasier?

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,159
l know a peaceful place in the country.
l could get you in.

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,678
Lovely grounds, nice food, casual dress.
Your tie and belt will be confiscated.

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,675
Frasier, l'm not going to a hospital.
l am not having any more sessions.

64
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,913
- We're through. Get the hell out.
- Sam! We did it!

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,390
- Did what?
- You're a whole person.

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,755
Really, l mean that.

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,150
- l am?
- You stood up to me.

68
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,915
You no longer need to run
from problems, need to drink,

69
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,676
or need to spend weekends
at a hospital, bombed on Thorazine.

70
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,553
- Goodbye.
- Wait a minute.

71
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,157
Sam, you must break this attachment.
Swim, Sam, swim.

72
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,959
No, Frasier, no.

73
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,513
l just want you to tell me what
you think put Diane in the ''ha ha house''.

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,195
l'm not her doctor,
and if l were, l couldn't discuss it.

75
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,830
lt doesn't matter.
She went nuts cos l kicked her out.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,393
Sam, l don't think you should use
the word ''nuts'' when discussing Diane.

77
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,677
Well, you've met her.
Give me a better one.

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,592
Bonkers.

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,794
You see, you don't
need alcohol to have fun.

80
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,515
ln my profession there's
no such thing as a closed door.

81
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
That explains how Diane got out.

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,954
As long as you have that humour,
you can't ever go completely astray.

83
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,917
- Goodbye.
- So long, Doc.

84
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,675
Hey, Frasier.
Say hello to all your loons for me.

85
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,356
Carla, why do you build walls
between yourself and everyone else?

86
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,671
Have you taken a good look
at everyone else?

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,840
TouchÃ©.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,118
Here's to Sammy. Ten days
without the slow death of alcohol.

89
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,354
No, don't toast me for that.
Getting back on the bottle was stupid.

90
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,556
l was reading in an article,

91
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,429
alcohol actually eats
huge holes in the tissue of...

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,149
Some people like bartenders
who tell great stories and jokes.

93
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,630
No, give me a good
temperance lecture any time.

94
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,916
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah, well.

95
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,514
l don't have an alcoholic personality.

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,830
You don't have a personality.

97
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,514
l'm going to resist hurling
a rejoinder in your direction

98
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,433
out of the respect l bear
for members of your gender.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,116
Please make sure that's all you bare
for members of my gender.

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,910
- Hello, everybody.
- Coach, come here.

101
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,553
- l've been dreading this moment.
- Why?

102
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,230
Diane will beg me to get back together
and l'm going to break her heart.

103
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,753
That's terrible.

104
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,198
No, the terrible thing is,
l'm looking forward to it.

105
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,599
And then after being in the Everglades,

106
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,595
Seminole lndians made me
the honorary mail carrier of the tribe.

107
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,319
- Hi, Sam. ls Frasier here?
- No, we finished our session.

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,119
He's making remarkable progress.

109
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,273
- lt's you l want to talk to, anyway.
- Yeah, l know. l figured.

110
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,830
You probably remember
where the office is, right?

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,436
Oh, yes. l've seen it in my dreams.

112
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,398
Coach, l'm going take a break.

113
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,751
Hey, Coach.
Who's ''Miss God's Gift to the World?''

114
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,879
l didn't see the show this year.
l think Miss Kansas won.

115
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,915
Strange to be here again.

116
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,110
- Using a new cologne?
- No, that's the roach bomb.

117
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,680
But, you know, that's not a...

118
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,638
Yes, well, down to business.

119
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,195
Sam, there's something
l've been keeping from you

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,351
and l've got to tell you now.

121
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,389
There's something l need to say to you
and l think l ought to go first.

122
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,279
No, l think maybe l should go first.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,353
Maybe.

124
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,551
l'm over you.

125
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,676
You're over me?

126
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,879
- You don't think that l still...
- You've got your...

127
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,878
- You thought l...
- Well, so did you.

128
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,833
We keep doing it.

129
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,319
Something we thought we'd
seen the last of is resurfacing.

130
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,516
Yeah, my lunch.

131
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,517
Rest assured l have
no feelings left for you. Nothing.

132
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,229
l assure you
l feel less than nothing for you.

133
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,519
- Then there's nothing really left to say.
- There is one thing you should know.

134
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,390
lt's important. There's another man
in my life and he's someone you know.

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,199
Really? Who?

136
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,193
Frasier and l have been lovers
for several weeks.

137
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,279
- What do you mean, ooh?
- l'm sorry.

138
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,558
l just got a little mental picture.
lt took me by surprise.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,109
Well, why didn't you
say something sooner?

140
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,070
Frasier didn't want to tell you
in case it interfered with your therapy.

141
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,676
We had a terrible fight about it... No...

142
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,559
we had a wonderful fight about it.

143
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,829
Frasier says fighting can be wonderful
if you lay out the rules, share your hurt,

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,357
and never lose respect for
the other's abundant humanness.

145
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,671
Boy, you people with full lives.

146
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,436
- Well...
- Well...

147
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,875
Wait, a second.
Guys, l think you ought to hear this.

148
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,558
Diane got herself a new fella.
She and Frasier Crane are lovers.

149
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,797
- What do you mean, ooh?
- l mean...

150
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,831
ooh...two should be very happy together.

151
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,354
Sam, l thought you said
she was still nuts about you.

152
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,353
l was wrong, and l'm happy to be wrong.

153
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,352
Me too.

154
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,434
Well...

155
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,118
- l guess this is goodbye.
- l guess it is.

156
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,670
What are you doing here?
l've been looking for you.

157
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,796
l'm so glad you're here.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,709
Diane, you shared our secret
with Sam, didn't you?

159
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,796
- Yes, and he took it wonderfully.
- ln fact, let me buy you a drink.

160
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,192
Why, thanks, Sam.
l'll have a white wine spritzer.

161
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,871
Well, OK. l'll have one, too.

162
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,996
lt's our drink.

163
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,440
- You two met in the bin, did you?
- Yes, and it isn't a ''bin''.

164
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,031
Golden Brook is a pastoral retreat.

165
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,992
Did you hold hands during the lobotomy?

166
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,716
Diane, take a joke.

167
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,796
l love you.

168
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,351
Frasier is a consulting psychiatrist.
He wasn't my therapist.

169
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,080
How did you two get together?

170
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,437
l was playing croquet
one beautiful morning.

171
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,912
lt's a game l learned during my stay
there and l got quite good at it.

172
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,789
l saw you do that.
You are a naughty, naughty girl.

173
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,316
- lt wasn't...
- l saw you do it. Be a grown-up.

174
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,314
lt was amazing how l could
lose myself in the game.

175
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,436
l'm annoyed.

176
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,955
When playing
with someone of equal ability,

177
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,750
it gave me an appreciation
for the nobler aspects of competition.

178
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,436
- What is this business?
- l'm not playing with you any more!

179
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,556
Fine, then go to...

180
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,759
Frasier happened by in the midst
of this spirited contest

181
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,912
and he stopped
to correct a flaw in my swing.

182
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,038
My opponent on that day
was as crafty a strategist as l.

183
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,158
We really brought out
the best in each other.

184
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,916
Girls! Ladies!

185
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,435
Frasier remained to watch my game,

186
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,718
and to good-naturedly
arbitrate a close call for us.

187
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,634
Under the attentive gaze
of a distinguished doctor

188
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,076
l lost some of my concentration
on the game itself.

189
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,196
Who's your doctor?

190
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,591
Who would guess
a leisurely game of croquet

191
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,955
would provide me with such a trophy?

192
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,872
lndeed.

193
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,834
That's quite a story.

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,468
How is your romantic life going, Sam?

195
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,952
l'm dating a girl that
l think may just turn out to be

196
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,396
the woman l've been
waiting for all my life.

197
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,596
Sam Malone!

198
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,830
You went out with my sister!

199
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,480
Did you think it wouldn't get back to me?

200
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,474
l have had just about as much
as l can take from you!

201
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,631
As far as l'm concerned,

202
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,553
you never existed.

203
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,272
Well, the search continues.

204
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,320
Swim, Sam, swim.

205
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,917
Great, now l have to work
another Saturday night by myself.

206
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,675
You promised you wouldn't
boink any more waitresses...

207
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,070
unless it was me.

208
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,188
l'm going to have to find somebody,
who l can keep my hands off of.

209
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,719
Are you looking for work?

210
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,719
Thank you very much
for the very attractive offer,

211
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,950
but l'm not interested.

212
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,076
l understand. How silly of me.

213
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,676
You couldn't possibly
come back to work here.

214
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,879
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's interesting.

215
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,835
l mean, it doesn't bother me at all,
but it must create a problem for you.

216
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,076
- Frasier, could we go now, please?
- Of course, dear.

217
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,836
This is goodbye for now, but there's
no such thing as a former patient.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,879
Once you've been my patient,
l'm always there when you...

219
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,510
Oh, great. l'll bet this is important.

220
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,198
- Where's the phone?
- ln the hallway.

221
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,275
- Why don't you have a seat there?
- No, thank you.

222
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,396
l understand.

223
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,956
What do you understand?

224
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,157
l assume what you said in there
was the truth,

225
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,108
but obviously you're feeling
sexual tension around me.

226
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,750
Sitting that close
would be kind of rough on you.

227
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,549
The fact of the matter
is l don't want to work here because

228
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,678
l think l have a better lot in store

229
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,628
than a life of serving beer
to squamulous laggards.

230
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,031
Please, Diane. The man's in the room.

231
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,871
- Tell Frasier l'm waiting outside.
- l understand.

232
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,272
lt'd be safer to wait around the corner.
l do give off this aura.

233
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,396
That's the roach bomb.

234
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,475
Diane, listen. Please!

235
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,916
l have something to say
and it's straight from here.

236
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,914
- What is it, Coach?
- This is my heart, isn't it?

237
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,473
Yes, it is.

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,713
Diane, if you walk out that door,
he's back on the bottle.

239
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,558
Well, l can't be responsible for that.

240
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,951
Diane, don't tear his heart
out again, please.

241
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,669
You'd do us both a favour
if you stick around.

242
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,594
Just a couple or three weeks.
Just till he gets back on his feet.

243
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,512
Please.

244
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,632
Well...

245
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,229
l've gone this far,
l might as well persist.

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,391
She's back!

247
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,793
lf Frasier approves, l'll stick around,

248
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,077
and help you through
your waitress problem.

249
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,597
Wait a second. You mean to tell me
you're coming back to work here?

250
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,355
l'll take it until a better job comes along.

251
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,717
Cleaning up after rodeos, for instance.

252
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,359
- Great, Sam? Diane's back.
- Great.

253
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,276
What did you say to her?

254
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,594
l said she walks out that door,
she's back in that nut house in a month.

255
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,239
l see.

256
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,439
- You're not going to tell her, are you?
- No, of course not.

257
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,357
Well, welcome aboard, Miss Chambers.

258
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,999
Thank you, Mr Malone.

259
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,676
That Coach is a pretty smart
fella sometimes, isn't he?

260
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,229
Yes, he is, Sam.

261
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,676
- Well, enough said about that.
- Yes, enough.

262
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,595
- Diane, shall we be off?
- l'm going to come back to work here.

263
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,512
What? No.

264
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,951
As Frasier Crane, MD, l don't think
that's a good idea for the two of you.

265
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,270
And as Frasier Crane, man,

266
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,671
l don't think it's a good idea
for the three of us.

267
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,355
Frasier, listen to me.
Sam needs my help in the bar.

268
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,997
lf you feel any jealousy,
let me assure you

269
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,994
l could work with this man
all my life and feel nothing.

270
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,039
Work? l could live in the same
house and never be tempted.

271
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,638
l could sleep in the same bed
and get nothing but a good night's rest.

272
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,759
l could get out of jail after twelve years...

273
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,233
...serve on a ship with an all-male crew
for another four,

274
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,676
be dropped off on a desert
island for another three,

275
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,593
eating nothing but raw oysters,

276
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,877
and if Diane came out
of the surf naked one day,

277
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,794
all l'd want from her
would be the hockey scores.

278
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,952
And you wouldn't even get that.

279
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,908
l'm afraid that's not good enough.
Diane, we're leaving.

280
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,152
Excuse me, Diane.
Doc, could l have a word with you?

281
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,595
- What about?
- Listen, Doc.

282
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,635
lf you take her out that door now,

283
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,669
those two will be dreaming dreams
about each other from now on.

284
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,878
But, if she worked here, Doctor, hatred.

285
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,993
l'm glad Coach stopped me
to ask me about

286
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,038
career opportunities in psychiatry.

287
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,077
Yes, Harvard is excellent.

288
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,074
You see, it gave me
some time to reflect.

289
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,358
- Diane, you must come back to work.
- l must?

290
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,557
You and Sam had
an emotional experience.

291
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,429
Now this will give you
an opportunity to defuse,

292
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,558
to demythologise your romance.

293
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,360
lsn't he amazing?

294
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,397
Abundantly.

295
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,799
- Sammy, are you going to tell Carla?
- Yeah...

296
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,520
Maybe you ought to give me a hand.

297
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,948
What's this all about?

298
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,235
- Got her?
- Check.

299
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,517
Carla, Diane is coming
back to work here.

300
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,712
Really?

301
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,874
At last, some help.
And she's had experience, too.

302
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,999
l hope she can start right away.

303
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,596
Take her in the back.

304
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,879
You think l'll try to kill her,
or hurt her, or maim her.

305
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,672
Walls, walls, walls.
Sam, Diane and l really must be going.

306
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,594
- But we'll be seeing each other again.
- l guess we will.

307
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,833
Hey, Frasier, let me congratulate you
on your new honey.

308
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,719
Thanks, Sam. l've never been happier.

309
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,917
Let me congratulate you, too, Diane.

310
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,757
For heaven's sake, give her a kiss.

311
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,511
- Yeah, why not?
- Why not?

312
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,636
Seems appropriate.

313
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,599
Now there's a healthy beginning.

314
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,436
Nuts about me.

315
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,713
Pitiful.

316
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,795
