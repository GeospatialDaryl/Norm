1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,030
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,272
- Okay, who's next?
- Make way for Norm.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,230
Come on in, Mr Peterson, and we've
got the bathroom-stuffing record.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,115
World's record, here we come!

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,115
We did it!
Congratulations! Drinks are on me!

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,516
The door's stuck.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,110
It won't budge.
There's too many people in here.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,638
Bartender must've stepped out.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,995
Have a seat.
I gotta use the bathroom, okay?

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,475
Occupied.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,198
Norm, we had the bathroom-stuffing
championship in our grasp and blew it.

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,794
Oh, gee, I see how I miscounted.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,476
Boy, I had myself down here twice.
See, "Woody" and "me."

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,152
Here's to noble failure, huh?

15
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,073
Norm, I can't drink to that.
There's nothing noble about failure.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,549
If there was, you'd be a duke.

17
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,910
Hey, Diane, hold it. Hold it.
Those aren't empty.

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,828
Sorry, guys,
I'm a little distracted tonight.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,075
Oh, yeah? You got problems, Diane,
or just the usual?

20
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,278
What do you mean, "the usual"?

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,990
You know, just how you usually are,
you know.

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,911
How am I usually?

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,879
So you're distracted, huh?

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
Yes, I have to come up with $500
as quickly as possible.

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,116
What for?
Hush money for Miss Clairol?

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,155
No. But I love the new thing
that you've done with your hair,

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,312
and I think you should
continue washing it.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,154
"Continue."
That was totally uncalled-for.

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,319
So what do you need 500 bucks for?

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,712
Well, are you familiar with the Farthing
for Your Thoughts bookstore?

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,916
I've dallied there betimes, yeah.

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,394
Very funny, Norman.

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,357
Anyway, I was browsing there
this morning

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,159
when I unearthed
a rare Hemingway volume.

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,639
I know what everybody's thinking:

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,633
"Diane Chambers' sensibilities
attuned to Hemingway?"

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,234
Wow, that's really close.

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,391
Anyway, I discovered that
Hemingway's signature is in the book.

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,269
And it's priced at a laughable $500.

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,635
The owners of the store
don't know what they're doing.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,918
It's right there on the title page:
"Ernest Hemingway, Madrid, 1927."

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,116
Why don't you ask
that rich old lady of yours, huh?

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,714
She's got more money than
me and God put together.

44
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,678
No, I can't ask Mummy.

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,116
- I'd rather die.
- I like that even better.

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,034
I told her long ago I was going
to prove my own worth.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,077
I refuse to go to her begging now.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,516
Come on, Diane, she's your ma.
She carried you for nine months.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,750
Eight. I was premature.

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,151
Couldn't wait to get out
and start yapping.

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,430
It has occurred to me that

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,398
I could possibly get the money
right here at Cheers.

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,031
If you can't rely on friends,
who can you rely on?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,679
I thought maybe I could ask Sam.

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,558
You bet.
He's got a lot of money.

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,069
But I don't know.
Given our past relationship,

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,471
I just don't think I'd feel comfortable
borrowing from him.

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,710
On the other hand,
I don't know where else to turn.

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,952
Well, Miss Chambers, I'm gonna
give you every bit of money I have.

60
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,119
- Oh, no, Woody. I couldn't.
- No, no, I insist.

61
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,637
Oh, wow, that's wonderful.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,792
I must've got my pockets
picked again.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,036
Well, welcome to the big city.

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,117
Thank you, Mr Clavin.

65
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,556
Woody.

66
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,392
- Thanks for trying to help.
- Thanks.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,279
Well, I guess I have no choice.

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,074
Now, how best to approach Sam?

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,510
I could appeal to his generosity...

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,596
...his good nature.

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,956
It wouldn't hurt to remind him
that I'm a woman.

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,356
I'd carry a sign.

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,152
Sam?

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,319
Is now a bad time?

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,792
No, but I think it's about to be.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,519
You goose.

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,715
Sam, would you say that
our relationship has matured?

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,273
If you mean getting kind of old, yeah.

79
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,236
Well, you're a regular Noel Coward
with a liquor license.

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,711
I don't-- I don't get it.

81
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,436
I'm painfully aware of that.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,276
Sam, I know you to be a man
of pride and principle,

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,433
but strength is also to be found
in the ability to bend.

84
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,910
Witness the willow,
nature's strongest tree.

85
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,389
No, I thought the oak was
the strongest tree.

86
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,913
Only in furniture.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,833
What about the saying
"strong as the mighty oak"?

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,231
The oak can be felled by a single harsh
wind under the right circumstances.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,277
But what about birch and mahogany?
Now, those--

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,829
Would you shut up
about the damn trees?

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,991
You brought them up.

92
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,596
Sam, would you loan me
$500, please?

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,719
Well, sure.

94
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,236
But I haven't even told you
what it's for yet.

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,517
Well, it doesn't matter.
Use it for whatever you babes buy.

96
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,229
Hair curlers, clothes,
sewing notions. Whatever.

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,039
It's nothing as trivial as that.

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,395
Hey, listen. I mean it.
It doesn't matter.

99
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,710
Really. I know how hard it was
for you to come in here

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,189
begging like a dog for a bone.

101
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,434
So I'm just trying to be sensitive
and not make things worse.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,990
Thank you for making it
easy for me, Sam.

103
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,430
This really is
an extraordinary attitude.

104
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,350
The truth is, I've had a lot of trouble
loaning people money in the past.

105
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,956
You know, hurt a lot of feelings.
Lost a couple of buddies once.

106
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,839
So I decided from now on,
anybody asks me,

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,629
I'm just gonna give them the money
and never expect to see it again.

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,916
Oh, you'll see it again.

109
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,072
Diane Chambers
always honours her debts.

110
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,635
Hey, I could care less. Really.
You walk out that door,

111
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,916
I'm not even gonna think
about that money anymore.

112
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,311
- You'll see it again.
- All right.

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,835
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,116
You handled this even better
than I expected.

115
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,238
But even so, it was hard to come
in here and ask for this,

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,358
given our past physical relationship.

117
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,274
Yeah, it kind of feels like you should
be giving me the money, doesn't it?

118
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,673
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,559
- Norman.
- What's the good word, Norm?

120
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,518
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.

121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,191
- No, not the Hungry Heifer.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,036
One heartburn cocktail coming up.

123
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,555
What's this Hungry Heifer place
you guys keep talking about?

124
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,951
It's this terrible restaurant where
Norm insists on torturing himself.

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,237
Hey, you're always giving the
Hungry Heifer a bad rap. I don't get it.

126
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,311
So I've had a few bad meals there.

127
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,754
But it's the best value in town.

128
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,353
Woody, their steaks come
by the pound.

129
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,238
Wow, the steaks are that big?

130
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,153
No, that's where they get them.

131
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,750
- I'll have to try it sometime.
- Yeah, I recommend Thursday night.

132
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,151
That's when the chef does
his tribute to swine.

133
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,111
Sam, two vodka tonics
and a Rob Roy, please.

134
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,477
By the way, Sam, has Diane
paid back that loan yet?

135
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,432
No, Carla, she hasn't.
But I could care less.

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,878
Not one dime? It's been
two weeks already, hasn't it?

137
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,758
Yes, Carla, it has.

138
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,718
But you can't expect her to pay
back that kind of money overnight.

139
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,313
She's just a hard-working waitress.

140
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,914
Diane got a job
as a waitress somewhere?

141
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,793
Sam, could you also give
me change, please?

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,758
- You bet.
- Okay.

143
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,879
My, what a lovely sweater, Diane.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,873
- Why, thank you, Carla.
- Is it new?

145
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,191
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
How nice of you to notice.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,672
Well, how could I help but notice
such a beautiful garment?

147
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,037
Cashmere, unless I miss my guess.

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,639
Yes, it is.

149
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,149
Must have cost you
an arm and a leg, huh?

150
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,110
No, no, it was marked down 2 percent
at Haute and Bothered last week.

151
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,717
Well, we girls deserve to splurge
on ourselves once in a while.

152
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,236
- Don't you think, Sam?
- I could care less.

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,590
All right, I'm ready for a beer, Sam.

154
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,437
Hey, what's Mr Clavin doing?

155
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,828
You're not gonna believe this,

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,878
but he's trying to get into the record
book for walking backwards.

157
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,030
Everybody, afternoon good.

158
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,351
That's-- That's "good afternoon,
everybody" backwards.

159
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,636
And you're an "assjack."

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,950
How close are you
to the record, Cliff?

161
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,430
Well, in two days,
1 7 hours, 33 minutes,

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,273
I'll be backing myself into the
history books. Thank you, Sammy.

163
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,671
I think I'll just take a quick reverse
strut around the old pool table,

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,070
pick up some women backwards.

165
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,197
All right, I know you guys think
that Cliff is pretty weird,

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,319
but I'll say this much for him,
he'll probably never reproduce.

167
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,870
Hey, that looks pretty good.

168
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,395
- You should just taste it.
- What is it?

169
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,471
It's lobster salad.

170
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,713
Lobster? Was there
a sale on that stuff?

171
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,598
This time of year?
Are you kidding?

172
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,110
- Would you like a bite?
- No, no. No, thanks.

173
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,592
No, it's okay, I got too much.
I'll just end up feeding it to a cat.

174
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,356
No, thank you. Thanks, anyway.

175
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,114
I lost my appetite here
for some reason.

176
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,272
- She's got new shoes too.
- Who does?

177
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,755
You know who. The one dribbling
lobster all over her cashmere.

178
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,672
- I could care less.
- You know something, Sam,

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,115
Diane certainly borrowed this
money from the right guy.

180
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,989
I mean, here she is,
throwing her cash around like water,

181
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,752
and she owes you a bundle.

182
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,388
Most people I know
would be going crazy now,

183
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,710
especially if they knew what
she spent that money on.

184
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,758
What do I gotta do,
tell you over and over?

185
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,433
I don't wanna know
what she spent it on.

186
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,275
I don't care what she spent it on. I'm
not interested in what she spent it on.

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,874
Sam, by the way, I'm gonna
be a little late tomorrow.

188
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,759
I'm having a facial and a massage.

189
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,837
What did she spend it on?

190
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,829
A book.

191
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,277
- A book.
- A book.

192
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,309
- One book?
- One single $500 book.

193
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,550
And it's already been a movie.

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,629
- A book.
- Excuse me.

195
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,911
Would anybody like
to buy some cookies?

196
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,675
Oh, I'd love to. I just can't refuse.

197
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,637
- I'll take three boxes.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.

198
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,270
And thank you. There's a little
something extra there for you.

199
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,749
Wow, thank you.

200
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,593
Oh, I just love these things.

201
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,509
Well, aren't you going to ask Sam
if he'd like some?

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,591
Of course I am.
Care for a cookie, Sam?

203
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,910
Oh, don't worry,
I have a lot more at home.

204
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,035
- Help yourself.
- Don't mind if I do.

205
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,232
Those are delicious.
I think I'll have a few more here.

206
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,478
Boy, but once you start,
you just can't stop, can you?

207
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
I probably shouldn't
have had that last one.

208
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,153
I like my cookies this way. It takes
the work out of chewing, you know?

209
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,558
Oh, hey, Diane, I'm so sorry
about this afternoon.

210
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,598
I don't know what happened.
I feel like a sack of dirt.

211
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,910
Don't be so hard on yourself, Sam.

212
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,230
I'm sure you're not
the first man in history

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,995
to throw a frothing fit
over 'Nana Doodles.

214
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,230
I just don't know
what came over me.

215
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,392
I do. Despite your assurances,

216
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,712
you do not lend money
with the sang-froid you claim.

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,911
I would like to see you in your office.

218
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,116
I have something I want to give you.

219
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
How about a good spanking?
I think I deserve it.

220
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,390
For some mysterious reason,

221
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,233
you seem to have doubted
my good intentions to pay you back.

222
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,709
Well, what's the mystery?
I haven't seen dime one.

223
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,872
Believe me, I fully intend
to return all your money.

224
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,678
And to prove my good faith,

225
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,035
I'm going to give you
what I purchased with the $500

226
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,431
for you to hold as collateral
until I repay you.

227
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,955
God, it really is a book.

228
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,032
It's a book, and a very
valuable book.

229
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,191
It's a first-edition Hemingway.

230
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,198
The Sun Also Rises.
Oh, that's real profound.

231
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,355
I purchased it for $500, but I'm
sure it's worth a great deal more.

232
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,234
It's signed by
Ernest Hemingway himself.

233
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,709
For 500 bucks, you'd think
Margaux Hemingway

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,758
would come over to your house
and act it out for you.

235
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,592
I'm taking a big risk entrusting
this to you, Sam.

236
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,035
Please, go put it in the safe.

237
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,076
And whatever you do,
don't let anything happen to it.

238
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,834
Don't touch it, don't scratch it,
don't scratch with it.

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,718
Hey, you know,
you really make me angry

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,110
when you treat me
like some kind of animal.

241
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,714
I'm sorry, Sam.
It won't happen again.

242
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,555
Just put it in the safe, please.

243
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,871
I'm sure there's room in there
right next to your bowl of kibble.

244
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,109
Smells boring.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,959
Mr Clavin, you're walking forward.
What happened to the record?

246
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,955
I was hours away,
and I met utter defeat.

247
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,639
Oh, that's too bad.

248
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,756
Yeah, it's doubly tragic.

249
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,229
If I had had a witness, I would've
gotten the world's record

250
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,279
for the loudest scream after
I backed into Ma's curling iron.

251
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,311
Well, I'll tell you something, Mr Clavin,
whether you set the record or not,

252
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,436
everyone here considers you a winner.

253
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,955
That's pronounced "wiener."

254
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,349
- Hey. Hey. Diane around yet?
- Not yet.

255
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,115
Good. Does anybody
know how to fix this?

256
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,954
What is it?

257
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,317
Well, it's Diane's $500 book.

258
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,276
No wonder it's so expensive.
It's inflatable.

259
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,796
No, no, it's not supposed to
look like that, Woody.

260
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,520
- What the heck happened to that?
- Well,

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,514
I got interested in the darned thing,
and I took it home with me and...

262
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,272
Then picture this.

263
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,192
I get into a nice hot tub.

264
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,158
I'm lying down to soak and read,
naked as a jaybird.

265
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,197
And I'm reading,
and I'm reading, and I'm--

266
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,318
Hold on, I can't get one
of your socks off.

267
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,917
Never mind. I can.

268
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,198
Anyway, I'm reading and reading,
and I finally come to the part

269
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,396
where they tell us
the terrible thing that happened

270
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,437
to this Jake Barnes guy
during the war.

271
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,512
- What's that?
- Well,

272
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,955
Iet's just say that suddenly
he could hit those high notes

273
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,519
Iike he never could before.

274
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,433
Ouch.

275
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,237
Yeah, ouch. That's why I dropped
the book in the water.

276
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,312
Now the darned thing won't shut.

277
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,914
All right, just rip out
every other page.

278
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,238
Come on, man.

279
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,517
Diane's gonna be really angry at me.
She told me not to touch it,

280
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,036
I touched it, and now it's fat.

281
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,675
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi. Hey, how's it going?

282
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,071
Oh, splendidly.
How's my precious volume?

283
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,310
It's fine.
Why do you even bring it up?

284
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,479
Well, don't be so sensitive.

285
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,078
I just asked because I bought the most
beautiful antique bookstand for it.

286
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,156
Is it expandable?

287
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,431
It's very nice. It's very nice.

288
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,874
The perfect complement

289
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,032
to my inscribed first edition
The Sun Also Rises.

290
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,553
Isn't it exquisite?

291
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,029
Excuse me, my name
is Bruce Sayers.

292
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,397
I'm an avid collector of
20th-century American literature.

293
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,993
Hello. Diane Chambers.

294
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,153
I heard you say that you have
an inscribed Sun Also Rises.

295
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,118
- Is it in good condition?
- Oh, it's a lovely copy.

296
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,669
No jacket, of course,
but signed by Papa himself.

297
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,159
And it's a lovely thought.

298
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,348
"Dear F. Scott,
boy, that Zelda is one crazy chick."

299
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,155
- It's a simple autograph.
- I wonder if it might be for sale?

300
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,078
Oh, no. I couldn't possibly place
a monetary value

301
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,958
on something so personal to me.

302
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,838
I'd give you $1,000 for it.

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,719
Make the check out
to Diane Chambers.

304
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,509
Sam, will you get this
man's Hemingway?

305
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,154
- No, you can't do that.
- No, it's perfect.

306
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,799
Now I can pay you back.

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,231
No, you can't sell the book.
You love the book, Diane.

308
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,233
Sam, we love people.

309
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,231
We own books.

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,960
Besides, even as a child
I found Hemingway to be

311
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,476
pretentious and over-mannered.
For my taste.

312
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,155
- Sam, go get it from the safe.
- Yeah, I see. All right, yeah.

313
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,518
This may take a minute. The safe's--
The combination's kind of complex.

314
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,955
Oh, don't you remember?
It's your birthday.

315
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,759
It is? Hell, I should be
out there celebrating.

316
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,558
Go, Sam.

317
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,551
Pull out these...

318
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,197
Sam?

319
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,478
Yeah?

320
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,270
I thought it would he better to
conduct our business in private.

321
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,910
- What's taking you so long?
- Well, I was just thinking.

322
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,036
Say no more.

323
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,954
You know, I was about
to open the safe...

324
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,232
...and a voice in
the back of my head said,

325
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,392
"Don't let Diane sell the book.
She loves that book."

326
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,472
The voice was wrong.
Open the safe.

327
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,871
I completely understand the value of
sentiment, but I must have that book.

328
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,955
Yeah, me too. That's why I'm
gonna give you 1,010.

329
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,111
- Sam.
- Eleven hundred.

330
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,510
- Eleven-ten.
- Do you know what you're doing?

331
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,592
- Eleven-fifty.
- I know it sounds crazy,

332
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,479
but when I was getting your book
out of the safe very carefully,

333
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,077
I started to look through the pages
very, very, very carefully, and l...

334
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,071
Well, I fell in love
with the darned thing.

335
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,554
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Yeah, you bet I am.

336
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,038
- Eleven-sixty.
- It must be an extraordinary specimen.

337
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,156
- Eleven-seventy-five.
- Twelve hundred.

338
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,038
- Twelve--
- Stop. Enough.

339
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,350
We're throwing around
monetary figures here

340
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,114
as if they had a place
in the world of art.

341
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,158
Sam Malone,
you have taught me a lesson

342
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,198
about the true value
of literature tonight.

343
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,079
I'm sorry, Mr Sayers,
the book is no longer for sale.

344
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,514
I want Sam to have it.

345
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,514
Oh, all right. Hey, I hope there are no
hard feelings here, Sayers, old man.

346
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,398
I can't say I'm not disappointed,

347
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,120
but it's heartening to know
there are people around like you.

348
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,599
People who love books.

349
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,194
Love them? I just wish
you could eat them.

350
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,880
I don't know what to say.

351
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,558
I'm looking at you in
an entirely new light.

352
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,196
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know myself,

353
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,352
but I think tonight I saw in full flower

354
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,353
the sensitivity you try so hard
to conceal.

355
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,639
Oh, well, that's-- That's no big deal.

356
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,156
Oh, no. You were wonderful.

357
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,710
Yeah, well, I guess my little
masquerade's over.

358
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,190
I am sensitive as all get-out.

359
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,030
Honestly, Sam, I don't know what
brought about this change,

360
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,910
but I find myself extremely
attracted to you just now.

361
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,635
There's something stirring
inside me.

362
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,873
I don't know what it is,
but I'm becoming flushed.

363
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,959
Yeah, maybe it is getting
a little hot in here.

364
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,358
Very hot.

365
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,872
And you mean all I had to do
was go nuts over a book?

366
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,272
Oh, I know it's crazy.
All the warning signals are flashing.

367
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,796
I never intended for this to happen,
but it's out of my control.

368
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,712
Kiss me, Sam.

369
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,113
You know, truth is, I've been thinking
about getting a lot more books.

370
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,159
Yeah, maybe even getting
a library card, huh?

371
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,157
- Oh, Sam.
- What?

372
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,515
- lsn't it amazing how life works out?
- Yeah.

373
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,035
When we woke up this morning,
who would have guessed

374
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,191
that we'd end the day this way?

375
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,715
Just look.
You have a beautiful book,

376
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,873
I've made myself a tidy little profit,
and we're in each other's arms.

377
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,471
A tidy little profit?

378
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,752
Yes. Your last bid was $1,200.

379
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,796
You expecting $1,200 from me?

380
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,636
No, of course not,
you big, foolish man.

381
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,349
I intend to deduct
the $500 I owe you,

382
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,999
and you really only owe me $700.

383
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,277
But let's stop talking
and start rejoicing.

384
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,396
Hold me, Sam.

385
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,869
Sam, you're holding me a little tight.

386
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,032
Sam, I can't breathe.
