00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,200
MAN ( <i>on radio</i> ):           
And we're on the help line      
            with...

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,600
Oh, me.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,800
Me, hi.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,000
Uh, hello?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,800
My name is Reb...

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,200
punzel.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
And uh, I'm sorry if I sound  
     a little bit nervous,

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,100
but this is the first time

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,000
I've ever called a radio show  
        for help.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
But I have this problem,    
     and it's so horrendous

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,000
that I didn't have anyplace else
            to turn.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,900
Now, I have this new boss       
            at work,

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,300
and he's incredibly rich    
 and he's incredibly powerful,

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,400
but he is also sort of a, um...

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,800
Oh, God, how could I put this  
     without sounding mean?

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,800
Um... a weasely little twerp.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,200
Anyway, this guy asked me out,

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,100
and to get out         
     of going out with him,

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,100
I told him that I was going   
  with this guy named Sam...

21
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,800
son.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,900
So, Samson, who can be     
 an incredible jerk sometimes,

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,200
told my boss, the twerp,    
    that we broke up.

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,300
All right, so my boss...

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
The twerp.

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,800
Right.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,000
My boss asked me out, and you're
not going to believe this.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,600
He proposed to me.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
I mean, the only thing      
    I could think of to do,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,700
without jeopardizing my career, 
      was to tell my boss

31
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,800
that I was still in love    
          with Samson.

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,400
But I cannot          
     keep avoiding the guy.

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,000
As an example, he is upstairs  
right now having lunch at Mel...

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Monico's. Melmonico's.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,700
The thing is,          
     that now I'm worried.

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
Do you think          
     I did the right thing?

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,800
I think so.

38
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,800
Now, did you have           
     a gardening question?

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,500
You called              
the <i>Dr. Green Thumb Show.</i>

40
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,300
Uh, just a reminder, <i>Rapunzel.</i>

41
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,100

Oh, yeah, I know, Norm,     
          that's a...

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
that's a beautiful birdie       
  you got there on the ninth.

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Thank you.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
Oh, so you guys                 
were playing golf today, huh?

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,300
Yeah, nothing like bashing
      the old pill around, huh?

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
Young Woody Nicklaus here       
broke 80.

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,100
All right; good man.            
                    Hey, really?

58
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,900
You shot under 80           
    for 18 holes?

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,300
Well, no actually, it was 17.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Yeah, the 18th hole
                is the windmill.

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,000
If you're stupid        
    enough to play that one,

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,700
it's going to eat your
        little colored ball.

63
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
You were playing                
miniature golf.

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,600
Do you have any idea

66
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,400
how long those real
              golf courses are?

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,600
TEAL:   
                      Gentlemen,

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,400
that was a pretty poor showing  
for a power lunch.

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,900
Ralph, you're going to have     
to start doing something more

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,200
than just taking up space       
    at these meetings.

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,900
How does a guy so young

72
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,000
get to be               
    so incredibly powerful?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I just try to maintain     
      a cheerful attitude

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,400
and not abuse my position.

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,600
I recently read a <i>Forbes</i> profile
     on our young Mr. Teal.

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
CLIFF:
                    Oh, yeah?

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Apparently, he started      
    with his father's firm,

78
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,500
kicked the old guy out     
        when he was 17,

79
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,300
hasn't looked back since.       
Big deal.

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
Did he ever win a purple ribbon

81
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,900
in the Jefferson County     
        Spelldown?

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Anathema.

83
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
A-N-A-T-H-E-M-A.

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Anathema.

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
Touché, Woody.

86
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,900
Touché. T-O-U-C-H-E,

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,500
and a little slanty line--      
            touché.

88
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Excuse me.

89
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,200
Is Miss Howe in?

90
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,100
She's in her office;      
 do you want me to go get her?

91
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
No, don't bother. Dennis?

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,700
Miss Howe?

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, no.     
     Oh, yes.

94
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,300
The master of the universe

95
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,700
awaits your presence.

96
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,500
Dennis, I-I
            sense bitterness.

97
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I've never heard you    
          talk like this before.

98
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, I could tell you stories,  
 honey.

99
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,000
Here she is, sir,

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,300
per your request.

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,100
So, how's the greatest          
love story ever told            
working out?

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Sam and I are just  
            as steady as ever.

103
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,900
As steady as yesterday          
when you broke up twice?

104
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
Things are different.

105
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Uh... It's ...
              it's more serious.

106
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,400
I won't consider it             
really serious

107
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
until I see a ring              
on your finger.

108
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Well, what I meant  
            by serious is, um...

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,300
is that Sam           
    and I are engaged.

110
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Hey, everybody.

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,800
Congratulations,
                          Sammy.

112
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,700
Oh? What for?

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,500
She was just a stewardess.

114
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,300
Stop joking,    
                you big lug,    
                and come here.

115
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Can you excuse us               
just a second, Martin?

116
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,100
We have to discuss              
our silver pattern.

117
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Dennis, get me the papers       
on the Trackwell merger.

118
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,800
Just keep your stupid           
mouth shut and smile.

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
We're engaged.

120
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,500
Oh. Great. Well,                
let's begin the honeymoon.

121
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,600
Sam, we're      
                not actually    
                getting married.

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,700
Well, that's even better.       
I can enjoy the honeymoon.

123
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,100
Come on, Sam.

124
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
It's just a way 
                to get Martin   
                off my back.

125
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, dear... you mean            
the problem-free relationship

126
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
suddenly                        
developed a glitch?

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,900
I can't very well tell  
        the future president

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,300
of the corporation no.

129
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,600
I'd never work again.

130
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,500
Please, Sam, just   
            help me out here

131
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
just until Martin   
            gets over me.

132
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Come on.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, I don't know.

134
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,800
You know, if I go   
            along with this,

135
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,700
will you go     
                to bed with me?

136
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,400
Let's put it this way.

137
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,200
If you don't                    
go along with this,

138
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
I will never go                 
to bed with you.

139
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,300
Wait. All right.    
            So, in other words, 
            if I don't...

140
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,100
No. Wait, wait.
            That means if you...

141
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,600
All right,  
                    this is me,

142
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
this is you,    
                this is the bed.

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Sam, just do it.

144
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
No, I don't...

145
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,700
Yeah, I don't   
                      personally

146
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,900
think we need the   
            salad forks, honey,

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
but you're
                 the entertainer
                  in the family.

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
Well, I suppose                 
congratulations are in order.

149
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,200
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

150
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Yeah, I never          
  thought I'd get her, but...

151
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,900
it looks like Becky here

152
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,800
is going to be                  
my ever-loving,

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,100
everlasting little              
bundle of kisses.

154
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,400
Little bundle                   
of open-mouthed kisses.

155
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
Isn't he sweet?

156
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,200
I'd like to propose             
a toast to the happy couple,

157
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
and especially                  
to Rebecca Howe--

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
the only thing I ever      
wanted and haven't gotten.

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Yeah. Same here.

160
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,400
Um... would you excuse me       
just for a minute, please?

161
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Hey, Sammy,

162
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,800
quite a squeeze-a-rooni
             you got there, huh?
                  I had no idea.

163
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Oh, Sammy,              
     tell me it isn't true.

164
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,700
Carla, come on.         
        It's not true.

165
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,900
I knew that.          
     You're a lousy actor.

166
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
I'm pretty good though, huh?

167
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,100
Well, actually, Carla,
    as a student of the theater,

168
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,300
I have to correct you.

169
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,400
What you were doing there   
        is not called acting.

170
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,700
It's called improvising.

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,100
Shut up, Woody.

172
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Now, that would 
                be directing.

173
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,000
So when's                       
the big event?

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
Well, I was kind of 
            planning on tonight.

175
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,300
You're getting married tonight?

176
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,400
Married? Oh, no.
                I'm sorry.

177
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,800
I thought you were talking
        about something else.

178
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,700
It is definitely not            
going to be tonight.

179
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,900
Look, the important             
thing is

180
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,800
that we are as one          
          forevermore.

181
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,500
Honeys till the end of time.

182
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Well, Sam,

183
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,500
I guess             
you wouldn't be interested

184
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,100
in spending the next month      
tending bar at a seaside resort

185
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
we reopened in Cancun?

186
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm there.

187
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,800
Whoa, hey.

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,900
Sam!

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,300
Oh, right. Yeah.

190
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Um, that wouldn't be fair       
        to Rebecca here.

191
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,900
Who could we get        
         to replace me?

192
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,300
Oh, no problem.

193
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,500
I'll make an exchange      
 with the bartender down there.

194
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, then, I'm out of here.

195
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Hey, I'll see you in a month.

196
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Adios, amigos!

197
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,500
REBECCA:                        
Sam?

198
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,100
Sam!

199
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,200
Sam!

200
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Martin, is this your little way 
of breaking Sam and me up?

201
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,300
It's a bona 
                    fide offer.

202
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
I need an       
                experienced     
                man down there.

203
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,700
I know what                     
you're thinking.

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,100
You're thinking that,           
when Sam gets down there,

205
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,700
and he's all alone,             
he's going to start roving.

206
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, I can                     
tell you this.

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
You can send Sam away           
for a month or a year,

208
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,200
and he will                     
only think of me.

209
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,600
Excuse me.

210
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,800
Do they have drug stores    
          down there,

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
or should I pack an extra bag?

212
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,200
Ramon, Ramon, Ramon,

213
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,600
you have been a terrific    
     replacement for Sammy.

214
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,900
I'm really going to     
        be sorry to see you go.

215
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,600
Although    
                    I will enjoy

216
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
watching you walk   
                  up the stairs.

217
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,700
( <i>speaking Spanish</i> )

218
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,400
( <i>speaking Spanish</i> )

219
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,700
Mi Carlita...

220
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,900
( <i>speaking Spanish</i> )

221
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Adios, amigos.

222
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Bye-bye.

223
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,400
CLIFF:          
                Take care of    
                yourself, Ramon.

224
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,400
I don't know what           
     that Latin lover said,

225
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,700
but I sure dig         
      the way he said it.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well, if you ask me,

227
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,000
Ramon's a lot more Latin    
          than lover.

228
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
Yeah, you know,

229
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
study after 
                    study show

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,200
that the old    
                sons of Spain

231
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,200
just don't have     
            our sexual prowess.

232
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,200
Cliffie, nobody         
    has your sexual prowess.

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Thanks, Norm. You know,

234
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
it seems that   
                the tropical sun

235
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
dries out a man's   
            vital juices.

236
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,400
You ever        
                seen a raisin?

237
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Have you ever seen a doctor?

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,300
Sam was supposed        
      to be in hours ago.

239
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,700
Has anybody heard from him yet?

240
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,800
No one's heard a word           
from him in weeks.

241
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Hello, Rebecca.

242
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,500
Heard from                      
Sam recently?

243
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
Have I?

244
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,100
Every hour on the hour.

245
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
It's almost embarrassing.

246
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,300
Hmm. Well, then                 
what's happened

247
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
seems all                       
the more curious.

248
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,600
What's happened?

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
According       
                to our reports,

250
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,000
Mr. Malone missed       
        the corporate jet home.

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Uh... well, I'm sure      
 there's a simple explanation.

252
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,300
I'll just call Cancun      
         this afternoon

253
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,900
and find out          
      what the trouble is.

254
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
We have Cancun on the line.

255
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,900
You are so helpful.

256
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,700
I am five months        
        from retirement.

257
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
Hello.

258
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,800
Sam, hi.        
                This is Rebecca.

259
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,300
You must have   
              missed your plane,
                you naughty boy.

260
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,300
So when should  
                I pick you up

261
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,600
at the airport, 
                my darling? Sam?

262
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Sam?

263
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Hello?

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,700
( <i>loud music playing</i> )

265
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,900
Sam? Sam?

266
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,000
Hello? Operator?

267
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
O-operator?

268
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,400
Yes, I was just talking     
    to my fiancé and I was...

269
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

270
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,000
Uh, me talk-o to me boy-o   
                amigo in Cancun,

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,100
and we were cut off-o.

272
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,500
It's a beautiful language,      
isn't it?

273
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,100
What?           
                You no operator?

274
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,500
You boose boy?

275
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, bus boy.

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,700
Yeah, okay, adios.

277
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,400
No, no, adios.

278
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Damn.

279
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
Thank you, Dennis.

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,500
Rebecca, you're not       
    losing anything in Sam.

281
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,300
I hear he hasn't stopped        
fooling around

282
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,200
since he got down there.

283
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
You had him watched?

284
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
I didn't have to.

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,400
The man's escapades             
have become legendary.

286
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,800
The Indians in the mountains    
sing a folk song about him.

287
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,700
Rebecca, let me help you take   
your mind off your problems.

288
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll pick you up for dinner,

289
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,400
maybe a drink,                  
a trip to Paris, a few laughs.

290
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Martin, not tonight.

291
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,800
I-I really need time
            to get over this.

292
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,900
Well, then tomorrow night.

293
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,200
I won't take no for an answer.

294
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I got him, I got him.

295
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,800
I caught my little              
Ricardo Montalban.

296
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,300
Just as he was                  
getting into a cab.

297
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,700
Go get your                     
little apron on, honey.

298
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Carla, how come you called Ramon
    Ricardo Montalban?

299
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
Because his tight little chinos

300
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,300
are so packed with rich,    
      Corinthian leather.

301
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,500
Oh, yeah, I see,                
now that you mention it.

302
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,700
NORM:     
                      All right,

303
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,000
I hate to change
                the subject,

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,900
but I don't know            
    if anyone else recognizes

305
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,600
we seem to have       
          a little problem here.

306
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Oh, you need          
  another beer, Mr. Peterson?

307
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,300
Okay, we have two problems.

308
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,800
Uh, there's           
     a distinct possibility

309
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,300
that Sammy may never come back.

310
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,600
FRASIER:          
              Frankly,          
              I don't blame him.

311
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Beautiful weather,              
miles of beaches...

312
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, chicks.

313
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,800
FRASIER:                        
No suits,

314
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
no rules, no tight shoes    
      to pinch your feet.

315
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,400
Yeah, that'd be good

316
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
to get out of the city     
a little bit, wouldn't it?

317
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
Oh, yeah.

318
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,500
I got five vacation days    
         coming to me.

319
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,700
Oh, say, it may be
              a crazy idea,

320
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,100
but why don't we   
             go down there, too?

321
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Lay out in the sun
              for a while,

322
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
work on that old    
             <i>mañana</i> attitude?

323
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,500
Should we do it?

324
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,800
What do you say,                
guys?

325
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,800
Ah, maybe tomorrow.

326
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,500
( <i>mariachi music playing</i> )

327
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,900
Excuse me, bartender,

328
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,300
can we get a couple of 
         pina coladas over here?

329
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Sure thing.

330
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,500
Let me just finish              
making this margarita.

331
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,600
So, anyway, Margarita...

332
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
<i>Buenos noches, amigos.</i>

333
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
<i>¿Que tal, Pepe?</i>                
                     <i>Hola, Pepe!</i>

<i>Esa agua esta muy fría.</i>

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,300
Good one, man,                  
good one.

338
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Let's go, Sam.         
         We're leaving.

339
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
I have a cab outside.

340
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Beckita, what          
      are you doing here?

341
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,300
I took the liberty

342
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,000
of stopping by your room    
     and packing your bags.

343
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,500
I can't believe you didn't pack 
    one pair of underpants.

344
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,600
Now come on, we're going home.

345
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,900
Home? Sweetheart, I'm...

346
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
This is home.

347
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,500
I love this place.

348
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,700
Sam, we are leaving       
    and we are leaving now.

349
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,400
I am not going to           
     get stuck with Martin.

350
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,700
Oh, right, right.

351
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,000
The little one.

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Uh, sweetheart, yeah,      
    I got to tell you,

353
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,200
I think it's high time      
    you told him the truth.

354
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I can't tell him the truth.

355
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
I'll get fired.

356
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,500
Well, they, uh,
                 they got plenty

357
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
of good job opportunities       
        down here.

358
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,400
Can you paint pictures          
on turtles?

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Sam, I am asking you, not       
 as a woman speaking to a man,

360
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,400
I am asking you as a friend.

361
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,500
Please, Sam.

362
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
When you look back

363
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,800
at all the countless,   
        selfish, petty,

364
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
vindictive things you've
        done in your life,

365
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
wouldn't it be wonderful
        if you could say

366
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,400
for one brief moment  
          that you did something
          good and fine?

367
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,700
This shouldn't be turning me on,
should it?

368
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, that's it.

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
<i>Cerveza,</i> Sammy.

370
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Be right there, Pepe.

371
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
If you won't listen             
to my pleas,

372
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,000
maybe you'll listen             
to this.

373
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,800
You're coming with me, Sam.

374
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,100
Now let's not do

375
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,900
anything crazy here.

376
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,800
I bet you wish you had     
     those underpants now.

377
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Listen, I'm gonna just reach out
my hand here real slowly.

378
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,000
I want you to relax 
            and take your finger
            off the trigger.

379
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,700
Just put the gun in my hand.

380
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm sorry.              
        It's not loaded.

381
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
I mean, I'm sorry, period.

382
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,300
It's not loaded, period.

383
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
It's-it's all right, everybody.

384
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,300
It was just a... just a joke.

385
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,600
( <i>all groaning</i> )

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm gonna go now.

387
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,900
W-w-where do you think
          you're going?

388
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
You can't just walk out of here.

389
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,500
You pulled a gun on me

390
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
in a resort in the middle       
     of a foreign country.

391
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,500
They have laws,
                 you know?

392
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Don't they?

393
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,100
Good-bye, Sam.

394
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,800

Oh, no,

396
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
she's like that all the time.

397
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,300
I mean, this isn't even     
    a bad day for her.

398
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
<i>¿Son todas las</i> babes <i>de Boston</i> 
     <i>locos como esta?</i>

399
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,600
No, no-- she's kind of     
    the queen of loco.

400
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,900
I mean, she was nutty      
    the first day I met her.

401
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
She's... she's hyper.

402
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
You know what I mean, hyper?

403
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
All she thinks about

404
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,400
is her stupid career

405
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
and she keeps blowing it.

406
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,900
And I can't tell you      
         how many times

407
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,000
I've had to pull that      
  lady's fat out of the fire.

408
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Get this, you know.

409
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,100
This is her latest escapade.

410
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,500
She wants me to pretend         
to be her fiancé,

411
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
'cause she doesn't              
want to marry

this pint-size executive        
back home.

What do I get                   
for my troubles?

414
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,900
A gun stuck in my face.

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,400
You know what                   
the sorriest thing is?

416
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
Me.

417
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,300
I still like her.

418
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Why is that, Pepe?

419
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
Nice buns, Sammy?

420
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,000
You people see things           
so clearly.

Hey, uh, Ramon.

422
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,800
Listen, we're heading over      
to <i>Casa de</i> Clavin

423
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,400
for our weekly

424
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,400
You want                        
to take Sammy's seat?

425
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I'm busy.

426
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,500
Yeah, well,                     
I've got it rented

427
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,400
for a couple of days.

428
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
How about tomorrow night?

429
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,100
Uh... I am busy.

430
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
Yeah?           
Sorry.

431
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Yeah, well,                     
he's a nice guy, that Ramon,

432
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,900
but he's no Sammy,              
is he, Norm?

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
But then again, Cliffie...

434
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,000
he's a lot more Sammy           
than you and I will ever be.

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,600
Hey, boss, last of the riffraff 
just cleared out of here.

436
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,500
You want to lock up?

437
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Sure, Carla, can you
            show me how a key   
            works again?

438
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, brother, you been           
in there drinking all night?

439
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,100
Carla, I am celebrating.

440
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,100
I think that I am the luckiest 
      woman in the world.

441
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm going to marry              
the geek tycoon.

442
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,100
And you know, he's going    
  to give me money and jewels

443
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,800
and all sorts          
         of rich stuff.

444
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,900
I am going to be so rich,       
          I can stink

445
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
and no one        
              will even tell me.

446
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,700
I'm sure you two                
will be very happy together.

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm sure I will, too.

448
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm gonna spend    
             the rest of my life

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,300
living in big,
                  old mansions,

450
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,900
wearing fabulous clothes

451
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,700
and being real nasty
            to the help.

452
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,800
You feeling sorry               
for yourself

453
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,200
because you have                
to marry a rich guy?

454
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,800
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo.

455
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,000
Come on, Carla.

456
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
You wouldn't trade
              Eddie for him.

457
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,300
I'd trade Eddie                 
for a ride in his car.

458
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Now if you'll excuse me,

459
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,500
I have a Spam casserole         
lurking in the oven.

460
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,200
Hey, we're the same size.

461
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
Hi, honey, you're home.

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
See?

463
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,100
Aren't I gonna make you
         a wonderful wife?

464
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,600
You've been drinking,           
haven't you?

465
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,800
Just a sippy or two
             to celebrate.

466
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Well, now that Sam's            
out of the picture,

467
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,800
I assume that leaves            
the path clear for me.

468
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Shall we proceed?

469
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,500
Rebecca...

470
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,700
will you do me the honor        
of becoming my wife?

471
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,400
I guess.

472
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Outstanding.

473
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,600
Shall we set a date?

474
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,900
Whenever. I don't care.

475
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,900
You're about to see       
      my impulsive side.

476
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,500
This is Justice     
            of the Peace Wilson,

477
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,700
these are four dozen            
long-stemmed red roses.

478
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm the perspective             
bridegroom.

479
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,700
Guess what you are?

480
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,500
Dead meat 
                      on a hook?

481
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,600
Um...

482
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,900
Martin, you can't do this.

483
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,100
My parents aren't here.

484
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Your parents aren't here.

485
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,700
My mother passed away,

486
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,000
and, uh,                        
you know my father.

487
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,500
Dennis?

488
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Welcome to the family.

489
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,400
MARTIN:                         
Rebecca,

490
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
you should know by now

491
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,000
that I haven't gotten           
where I am

492
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
by waiting for things           
to come to me.

493
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,400
As far as I'm concerned,        
this is a done deal.

494
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,700
So let's make it legal.

495
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Hey, baby, I'm back!

496
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,500
Call off the <i>Federales.</i>

497
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
Sam!

498
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,500
I couldn't stay away from you  
for another second, my darling.

499
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Kiss me.

500
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,200
Oop...

501
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Hey, did I interrupt      
        something here?

502
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
No, Martin and I
                were just going 
                to get married,

503
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,800
but now that  
                  you're back...

504
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,100
Oh... Martin.

505
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm so sorry.

506
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,200
This is really      
            tearing me apart.

507
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,800
But I need         
             to follow my heart.

508
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,300
Well, if that's what you feel, 
    Rebecca, you've got it.

509
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,100
I hope you two                  
will be very happy together.

510
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,100
But remember: you blew it       
in a big, big way.

511
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,000
I hope this won't affect    
our business relationship.

512
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,600
Why should it?

513
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,500
Gee, when I sober up,

514
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm probably going          
      to worry about this.

515
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,900
Better not let that happen.

516
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,800
I don't believe this.

517
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
You came all the way back here 
          just for me?

518
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
I just feel so terrible

519
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,600
for everything I ever said      
         or did to you.

520
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,700
Well, gee, now, there must be  
some way you can thank me.

521
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,700
You're right, Sam.

522
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,000
I think the time            
    has finally come.

523
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,300
Yeah.

524
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,100
You've waited long enough.

525
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Oh...

526
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,800
Oh, no.

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
That's funny.

528
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,200
Usually they pass out      
          afterwards.

529
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,900
No, no, no.

530
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
I am a gentleman.

531
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,900
But I may never         
    have this chance again.

532
