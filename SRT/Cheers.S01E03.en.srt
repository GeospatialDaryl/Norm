1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,870
OK.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,468
Shot of bourbon. Beer chaser.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,479
Bloody Mary without Tabasco,
and with extra Tabasco.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,990
Coffee. Cream. Sugar. Sweet'N Low.

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,873
CC water back. Pretzels.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,675
Pitcher of water with three glasses.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,269
Those are our drinks.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,677
I'm terribly sorry.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,111
I don't suppose I could impose upon
you people to save me a few steps?

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,275
Thanks. Thank you, really.
Thanks so much.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,868
Free pretzels for everybody.

12
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,836
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,279
Norman.

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,834
- Beer, Norm?
- I've heard of that stuff.

15
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,428
Better give me a tall one
in case I like it.

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,353
- Another day, another dollar.
- 50 cents after taxes.

17
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,994
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, girl. How's the kids?

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,635
Two of them are ugly, one's obnoxious
and one's just stupid.

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,159
He's my favourite.

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,998
- Get me Gus.
- Yes, sir. Right away. Gus who?

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,156
Don't be a wise guy. Just get him.

22
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,070
Alright, yes, sir.
Norm, do you know a Gus?

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,239
- Gus who?
- He hates that question.

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,156
Gus, the owner of this bar.

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,035
I know who you mean.
That was two owners ago.

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,039
I'll never forget that guy.
He had such a great name. Gus.

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,230
I came from Seattle to talk to him.
Gus is the man.

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,750
You got troubles, you take 'em
to Gus, he straightens you up.

29
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,952
I've gotta be back in Seattle
Thursday night.

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,036
Take it easy.

31
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,553
Listen, I managed in the minors,
I coached in the majors,

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,955
I've been a bartender for five years.

33
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,514
I've had my share
of people with problems.

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,954
Why not give me a try?

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,957
My son comes home from college
with his new fiancÃ©, who's black.

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,516
And your son's not?

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,989
Yo, Coach.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,519
Get Gus.

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,629
I'll make a few calls.

40
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,752
Good idea. Give me a Scotch.
I'll be right back.

41
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,553
- Holy... !
- What's the matter, Norm?

42
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,353
Somebody pinch me.
I've got to be hallucinating.

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,595
Look at those legs!

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,157
If they're attached to anything,
even a truck, I'm gonna marry it.

45
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,239
Please come down here. Please.
She's coming down here!

46
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,914
Alright, everybody, just act natural.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,712
This I gotta see.

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,517
I don't believe this. I feel like
I've been transported in time

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,029
back to a fraternity house
in the '50s.

50
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,030
Come on, guys. In this day and age,
aren't we beyond ogling women?

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,798
Holy... !

52
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,154
Norm, is that the one?

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,271
- Hi.
- Hi.

54
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,792
Excuse me, miss.

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,516
The gentleman at the end of the bar
would like to buy you an automobile.

56
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,279
- May I help you?
- White wine, please.

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,473
- White wine.
- Here, allow me. I got it.

58
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,349
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

59
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,111
Don't get your hopes up, boys.

60
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,392
As soon as Sam comes out here,
it's dinner for two at his place.

61
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,718
Come on.

62
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,389
I hardly think that's the sort
of woman Sam would go out with.

63
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,274
Listen, she may not
be flashy enough for Sammy.

64
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,277
They had Sammy in mind
when they built her.

65
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,631
Really? I don't buy that.

66
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,194
I know I've only worked here
a short time,

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,437
but it seems to me
Sam has more depth than that.

68
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,631
Follow me.

69
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,391
Sam, would you come here a second?

70
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,195
Carla, never disturb me...
unless there's a customer.

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,636
No, don't drink that.
I've got something much better.

72
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,793
I think you're gonna like this.
It's an amusing little wine.

73
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,638
You like to laugh?

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,719
- I love to laugh. How did you know?
- Call it a hunch.

75
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,631
The great ones make it look so easy.

76
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,559
Is there chance that you and I could
go someplace and laugh together?

77
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,073
My mother told me
to watch out for guys in bars.

78
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,113
Well then, let's get out of this bar
so you don't have to worry.

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,995
I do feel like a movie tonight.

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,669
I've been in the mood
for a movie all day long.

81
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,034
- What kind of movie shall we see?
- Something short.

82
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,435
Could you be a little more specific?

83
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,516
Does anybody know any good movies?

84
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,393
What's that new Australian film
that's good?

85
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,910
No. No Australian films.
I hate subtitles.

86
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,751
This one's no problem. It's dubbed.

87
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,554
Will you excuse me?

88
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,831
Diane, can I talk to you
in the poolroom?

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,279
Sure.

90
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,233
I'll be right back. What's your name?

91
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,469
Brandee. With two Es.

92
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,996
Brandee with two Es?

93
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,396
A big company like this,
they spelled it wrong.

94
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,636
- OK, what was that all about?
- What was what all about?

95
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,354
All that laughing and stuff?

96
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,516
"I love to laugh."

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,275
- Diane, can we have two beers?
- Coming up.

98
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,710
- No. Not right now.
- Sam, we're thirsty.

99
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,512
Drink chalk.

100
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,197
Sam, I didn't mean anything by that.
I laughed. Life is funny.

101
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,639
Correct me if I'm wrong,

102
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,070
but I get the impression
that you don't approve of Brandee.

103
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,033
Is that Brandy with a Y or two Es?

104
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,792
I may be the dim ex-baseball player
and you're the postgraduate,

105
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,559
but I'm the boss
and I didn't hire you as a critic,

106
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,036
- I hired you as a waitress.
- You'd never know it by me.

107
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,831
Beer. With two Es.

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,751
Will you guys just sit down
for a minute, please?

109
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,039
Thank you.

110
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,389
Why don't you be honest with me?
You think Brandee's dumb.

111
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,671
- I never said that.
- But you think she's dumb.

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,999
- I don't know that I think that.
- Diane, she's a tree stump. Come on.

113
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,188
I guess she'll do
until dumb comes along.

114
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,197
Well, thank you very much.

115
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,232
The truth comes out.
She's a total airhead.

116
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,318
- Incredible body, no mind.
- Who?

117
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,159
I don't think that.

118
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,748
To you, Brandee's a one-night woman.

119
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,270
Built for cheap laughs,
wild times and easy sex.

120
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,631
- Where?
- Will you just admit it?

121
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,912
Sam, I've got a message for you.
Your date, Miss Bigbuckets?

122
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,077
She told me to tell you
she's getting a little "ootsy".

123
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,793
Get her out. The customers are
warping the wood with their drool.

124
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,438
- Diane, come here. Listen...
- Wait a minute.

125
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,232
I don't mean to criticise.

126
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,152
In a way, I was complimenting you.
You can do better.

127
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,236
I don't want to do better.

128
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,830
There are certain things in this life
that I really like,

129
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,235
and nobody's gonna change my mind.

130
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,194
I like fun women,
hot dogs, game shows.

131
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,912
I don't care what anybody says.

132
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,315
Did you read
they found rat parts in hot dogs?

133
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,876
I like rat parts. It's my
favourite part of the hot dog.

134
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,153
OK.

135
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,115
And one more thing I like. Brandee.

136
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,357
I sensed something very special
going on there.

137
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,871
So if you'll excuse me, that very
special somebody is waiting for me.

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,433
Fine.

139
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,672
- Coach?
- Yeah?

140
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,398
- Where's Brandee?
- She just left with some guy.

141
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,638
- She what?
- Looked like the real thing, Sam.

142
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,430
If I see one sign that you're
enjoying this, you're in trouble.

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,231
How about a couple of beers
for the boys in the poolroom?

144
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,639
OK.

145
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,313
Another beer, Norm?

146
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,112
Yeah. One quick one
and then it's <i>adios</i> for sure.

147
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,999
Here you go. No, it's a guy.

148
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,032
Coach, any word from Gus yet?

149
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,199
Yeah, Leo.
He can't drop by tonight. He's dead.

150
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,553
- Oh, no.
- Leo, it happens.

151
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,478
I can't believe it. Gus is gone?

152
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,433
Nobody can replace Gus.
Gus had all the answers.

153
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,312
All but one.

154
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,479
- What am I gonna do without Gus?
- Leo, will you stop it?

155
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,230
Ever since you came through
that door, it's been Gus, Gus, Gus.

156
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,035
I mean, it's Gus this and Gus that,
and I'm fed up with it.

157
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,958
I'm taking you on.
You and all your problems.

158
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,957
- Come on, sit down.
- I don't know.

159
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,752
Sit, Leo.

160
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,148
Sit!

161
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,197
Throw your problems on the bar.

162
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,232
- Come on, give him a chance.
- He's ready for you.

163
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,112
Nothing to be afraid of.

164
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,395
My son comes home from college
with his new fiancÃ©, who's black.

165
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,876
I thought about that. It's a tough
one, but I think I've got it.

166
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,629
- Wait a minute cos there's more.
- No, hold it, Leo.

167
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,275
Leo, it's a problem
of communication.

168
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,990
Here's what you do,
when you get home,

169
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,157
you sit the kids down
and say to your boy...

170
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,919
- What's your boy's name?
- Ron.

171
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,317
What's Ron's fiancÃ©'s name?

172
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,319
- Rick.
- Rick. So, you say...

173
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,433
You say, "Rick, Ron..."

174
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,474
Rick and Ron?

175
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,229
Suck it up, Coachie.
Hang tough in there.

176
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,393
Leo...

177
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,558
Leo, if you're that unhappy about it,
just throw him out

178
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,069
and tell him you never want
to see him again.

179
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,555
I can't do that. I love the kid.

180
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,952
- I see what you're saying.
- You do? What?

181
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,430
If I can't accept the kid
the way he is, I'll lose him.

182
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,437
Boy, that's good.

183
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,993
When you put it that way,
what choice do I have?

184
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,953
Thanks, Coach.
You're not Gus, but you're not bad.

185
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,672
Leo, even Gus isn't Gus any more.

186
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,875
- Thanks, Coach.
- Alright, Coach!

187
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,153
Alright, Coach.

188
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,029
You got him. You really took him.

189
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,549
Took him? I had him for breakfast.

190
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,630
Coach, where's Sammy?

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,718
Out, where else?

192
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,833
Again? He's been out
with a different dolly every night.

193
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,191
He's overcompensating
for feelings of inadequacy

194
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,437
with an ostentatious display
of hormonal activity.

195
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,039
That's our Sammy.

196
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,550
Let me tell you something.

197
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,558
There are drawbacks
to dating beautiful women.

198
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,432
Yeah? Like what?

199
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,552
You can't eat ltalian
cos always they're on diets.

200
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,070
You can't go outside
cos the wind will muss their hair.

201
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,156
You can't go to hockey games

202
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,636
cos they might get hit
in the face with a puck.

203
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,830
Where's the fun?

204
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,235
Carla, the fun's in the fun.

205
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,713
Yes. Unlimited sex.

206
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,150
The adult male's version
of owning a candy store.

207
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,914
But tell me, once you've consumed
as much sex

208
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,952
for as long as you want it,
what would you do then?

209
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,151
I'd help the poor.

210
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,835
- I can't stay long.
- One drink.

211
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,312
The man's got a harem.

212
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,832
- You all know Debra.
- Hi, Coach. Hi, guys.

213
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,228
Diane, this is Debra.
Debra, this is Diane.

214
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,634
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,795
Debra.

216
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,438
- What are you drinking?
- A very dry martini.

217
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,190
That's a very classy order.
We're gonna have a very dry martini.

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,359
Nothing for me.

219
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,077
We just back from Symphony Hall.
Heard Mozart's <i>Symphony No.41.</i>

220
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,794
Sometimes called
the <i>Jupiter Symphony.</i>

221
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,558
Debra's idea.

222
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,434
I haven't heard a lot
of classical music, but I like it.

223
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,112
What was that comment
you made in the intermission?

224
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,071
"Give me a cigarette"?

225
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,399
Not that one.
The smart one about the music.

226
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,631
Yeah. I said, "It's hard
to believe that all that music

227
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,751
could come out of one man's head."

228
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,348
- "One man's head."
- I heard.

229
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,436
Where else could it come out of?

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,070
I read in the programme
that Mozart died when he was 35.

231
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,237
Imagine writing all that music
before you're 35.

232
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,352
Slow down. You're giving us
too much to think about.

233
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,230
I have got to be going somewhere.

234
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,272
Just as well. Our heads are spinning.

235
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,119
Wait. Debra,
you forgot your programme.

236
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,435
- Thank you.
- I love Mozart, too.

237
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,955
- This programme's two years old.
- Is it?

238
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,909
Yes.

239
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,118
Well then, Mozart must have been
37 years old when he died.

240
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,157
I didn't say
we came straight from the concert.

241
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,119
OK, we went to see <i>Star Wars</i> again
and I'm glad.

242
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,033
- How did I do?
- Well...

243
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,232
Thanks.

244
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,395
- Don't.
- Fine.

245
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,158
I'm gonna play pool.

246
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,189
Carla?

247
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,110
You've known Sam a long time.

248
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,471
Has he ever had a relationship
with an intelligent woman?

249
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,958
That's the best I've seen.

250
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,112
- What about his ex-wife?
- That was his ex-wife.

251
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,119
I'm gonna go back there
and talk to him.

252
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,311
"Blonde Chick
Dies in Billiard Accident."

253
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,597
- Sam?
- Go away. I'm reading Plato.

254
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,033
- May I speak with you for a moment?
- No.

255
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,878
I came in to cheer you up a little.

256
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,836
I know why you brought Debra here.

257
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,474
You're trying to prove
you date smart women.

258
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,751
No, I brought Debra here
for a drink. This is a bar.

259
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,790
Come on.

260
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,356
- No, it's a bar. Is this a bar?
- Yes.

261
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,073
Excuse me.

262
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,160
I sense that you're unhappy
right now.

263
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,317
Unhappy? I'm not unhappy.
I'm on top of the world.

264
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,634
What a life I lead.

265
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,514
Tomorrow, I'm going out with
a girl who wears a pinwheel hat.

266
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,919
Would you stop making jokes
and talk to me?

267
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,037
OK, I'm all cheered up now.
You can leave. Thanks.

268
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,750
Why are you so upset?

269
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,511
This week, I have gone out
with all the women I know.

270
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,200
All the women I really enjoy.

271
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,154
All of a sudden, all I can
think about is how stupid they are.

272
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,956
My life isn't fun any more,
and it's because of you.

273
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,349
- Because of me?
- Yeah. You're a snob.

274
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,272
- A snob?
- Yeah, that's right.

275
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,035
Well, you're a rapidly ageing
adolescent.

276
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,558
Well, I would rather be that
than a snob.

277
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,071
- And I would rather be a snob.
- Well, good, because you are.

278
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,398
Do yourself a favour. Go back
to your tootsies and your rat parts.

279
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,876
I'd hate to see the bowling alleys
close on my account.

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,319
Wait a minute.

281
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,228
Are you saying that
I'm too dumb to date smart women?

282
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,477
I'm saying that
it would be very difficult for you.

283
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,434
A really intelligent woman would see
your line of BS a mile away.

284
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,391
You think so?

285
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,115
Well, I've never met an intelligent
woman that I'd want to date.

286
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,595
On behalf of the intelligent women
around the world, may I just say...

287
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,993
Well, come on.

288
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,918
Wait. It depends
what kind we're talking about.

289
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,951
- Just the average.
- Any kind.

290
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,676
You take your average whale's
intestines and stretch 'em out,

291
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,360
you're looking at three miles
and change.

292
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,191
You win again, Coach.

293
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,153
This man knows his animal kingdom.

294
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,793
It's getting late.

295
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,199
It's about time this old cowpoke
moseyed off to the bathroom.

296
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,589
Black Label over, Bloody Mary,
a shot of vodka.

297
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,031
Look, I am sorry.
I said a lot of stupid things.

298
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,154
I shouldn't have. I apologise.
I was kind of upset.

299
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,557
OK, I'm sorry, too.

300
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,995
We both got a little carried away.

301
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,879
Especially you.

302
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,629
- Well, I'll be darned.
- What?

303
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,469
- Nothing. I just noticed something.
- What?

304
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,511
I guess
I've never looked into your eyes.

305
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,631
Something wrong with them?

306
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,390
No. I just don't think I've ever seen
eyes that colour before.

307
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,029
Matter of fact, I don't think
I've ever seen that colour before.

308
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,873
Yes, I have.

309
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,959
Where?

310
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,151
I was on a ski weekend
up at Stowe.

311
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,515
I was coming in late one day,

312
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,952
last person off the slope
as the sun had just gone down.

313
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,038
The sky became
this incredible colour.

314
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,234
I usually don't notice
things like that,

315
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,158
and I found myself walking
around in the cold,

316
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,279
hoping that it wouldn't change,

317
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,995
wishing that I had somebody there
to share it with.

318
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,636
Afterwards, I tried to convince
myself that I'd imagined that colour,

319
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,079
that I hadn't seen it,

320
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,749
that nothing on this earth
could be that beautiful.

321
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,432
Now I see I was wrong.

322
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,078
Wouldn't work?

323
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,674
What?

324
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,398
An intelligent woman
would see right through that.

325
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,597
In a minute.

326
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,992
Damn.
