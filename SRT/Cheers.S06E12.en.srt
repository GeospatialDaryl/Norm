00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:50,379
                  Thanks for    
                  the soap, Sam.

469
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:54,049
                 Ooh, and       
                 it's pink, too.

470
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,151
          Uh, listen, I'm sorry 
          about the mix up here,

471
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,486
     but my boss seems to really
     love the diamond earrings. 

472
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:00,088
                 Can I buy them 
                 from you maybe?

473
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:03,225
 Well, they were for my mother. 
        They cost $500.         

474
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,293
                $500?           

475
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,761
    Um, I'll be right back.     
            Rebecca?            

476
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:07,829
        Sam, uh...              

477
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,364
    I don't know what to say.   

478
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,633
          I'm really overwhelmed
          by your generous gift,

479
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,502
                but I think it's
                inappropriate.  

480
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:16,638
You mean... you're...           
you're giving it back?          

481
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:18,740
You don't... you don't          
want to keep it?                

482
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,943
            I think I should.   

483
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,611
          Oh, well...           

484
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,013
    if that's the way           
    you feel, but I...          

485
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,547
    I want you to know          
      that I wouldn't have      

486
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:29,284
  bought these for you unless   
  I wanted you to have them.    

487
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,553
                     Well, they 
                     are pretty.

488
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,992
            Thank you.          

489
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,463
Is that "thank you" you're      
    giving them back to me,     

490
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,000
         or "thank you"         
you're going to keep them?      

491
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:47,235
             I'm afraid that    
             I've misjudged you.

492
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,937
              You're very sweet.

493
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:50,471
        Aw.                     

494
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,473
                  Would you like
                  to come over  

495
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,976
             to my house tonight
             for a late supper? 

496
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:57,712
Well, that sounds               
very inviting.                  

497
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:00,715
                And I'll wear   
                my new earrings.

498
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:03,785
        ( <i>to himself</i> ):         
     And very little else.      

499
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,125
         Uh, damn! Oh!          

500
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,160
        That witch is gonna     
        make me work tonight.   

501
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:13,796
Yeah, and after I gave her      
    the earrings, too.          

502
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,030
    I just can't believe it.    

503
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:16,615
     Oh, I guess that means     

504
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,667
      there's no lingerie       
      fashion show, then?       

505
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,369
Well, maybe we could do it      
        some other time.        

506
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,570
    What do you think?          

507
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:24,039
      Well, I don't know.       

508
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:26,024
      It just seemed like       
    such a Christmasy thing     

509
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,158
          to do.                
                        Yeah.   

510
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:29,644
Oh, well.                       

511
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:31,813
Just write me a check for       
the earrings and I'll be going. 

512
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,048
    All right, and that was     

513
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:36,652
      500-- and she better      
    be fantastic-- dollars.     

514
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:39,087
        And there we go.        

515
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:42,524
            All right, uh, well,
            thank you very much.

516
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,726
    You sure, uh, you sure      
    you're not upset about this?

517
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,795
No, I'm just going to go        
over to my mom's house.         

518
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,930
She's probably still up         
getting everything ready        

519
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,098
for tomorrow.                   
                        Yeah.   

520
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,232
You know, baking the bread      

521
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,401
and icing the cookies           
and stuffing the turkey.        

522
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:54,870
SAM:                            
Yeah.                           
          Stuffing?             

523
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,672
Oh, yeah, my mom                
makes it from scratch.          

524
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:00,108
    Gee, so does mine.          

525
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,710
    Yeah, but does your mom     
    make it bone dry?           

526
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,779
      You could gag on it.      

527
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:09,751
      Hey, don't tell me.       

528
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,619
Do you have a manger scene      

529
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:12,620
                     on your    
                     front lawn?

530
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:13,989
The biggest on our block.       

531
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,190
             Oh...              

532
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,959
 The Wise Men are my favorite.  

533
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:19,094
        Oh, I love Balthasar.   

534
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,629
Oh, Balthasar's good,           
but Melchior, he's the best.    

535
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:22,764
                ( <i>chuckles</i> ):   
                Okay, well...   

536
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,066
              Listen, I'd       
              introduce you two,

537
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,468
but something tells me you've   
known each other for years.     

538
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,805
              You driving, Carl?

539
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,507
No way, B.J.                    

540
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,175
I'm over my limit.              

541
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,343
      Don't ask me.             

542
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:36,912
    I'm gonna sleep             
    where I fall.               

543
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:37,896
                    Yeah...     

544
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:40,865
                  Doesn't that  
                  just epitomize

545
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:42,633
         the spirit of Christmas
         in the '80s?           

546
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:43,835
             NORM:              
        Merry Christmas.

            Santa Clauses...

     You have a good night.     
         Take it easy.

        a designated driver     

550
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:51,226
              to take the sleigh
              ride home.        

551
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,227
                         MAN:   
                         Well...

552
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:55,046
                I hate to leave,
                but, uh...      

553
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,048
I've got a busy night,          

554
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,651
and a long haul ahead of me.    

555
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:01,720
Night.                          

556
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:04,423
            Anyone remember that
            guy from class?     

557
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:05,590
No.                             
                 I don't, uh... 
          Beats me.             

558
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,459
        I thought               
he was a friend of yours.       

559
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:09,695
            No, no, no. Not     
            a friend of mine.   
No, he came over with you.      

560
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,095
            No, I could swear   
            that he came with...

561
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,597
        Okay, wait, now wait.   
        Wait a second now.      

562
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,300
            You don't suppose...

563
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,101
     ( <i>patrons chattering</i> )     

564
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:19,120
Did you                         
hear that?                      

565
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:20,622
Nah...                          
                Suppose it could
                be the wind,    

566
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,390
              but it sounded    
              like sleigh bells.

567
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:25,177
              Oh, come on, guys.
              I mean, seriously,

568
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:27,145
        there must              
      be some explanation.      

569
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,830
                    Well...     

570
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:31,633
        Geez, do you...         

571
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,468
          do you think          
  there actually could be a...  

572
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:38,573
Oh, my wife's                   
gonna kill me.                  

573
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,942
I left the lights on in         
the station wagon again.        

574
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:42,677
Can one of you guys             
give me a jump?                 

575
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:45,246
            Eh...!              

576
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:50,485
  Lilith, that was a miracle.   

577
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,288
            Snowball, you've had
            too much schnapps.  

578
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:56,191
No, no, I'm stone sober. It's...

579
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,843
I mean, I know that's           
just some fat old guy           
with car trouble, but...        

580
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:01,879
for half a second there, I      
actually believed in Christmas. 

581
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:05,016
And th-that hasn't happened     
to me since I was...            

582
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:06,784
    born.                       

583
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:10,255
Come on, let's, uh,             

584
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,856
        let's sing some         
        Christmas carols        

585
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:16,161
    and roast some chestnuts    
    and all that treacle...     

586
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,382
      FRASIER AND PATRONS:      
         Deck the halls        
     with boughs of holly      

587
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,817
     Fah-la-la-la-la,          
         la-la-la-la           

588
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:25,453
 'Tis the season to be jolly   

589
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,788
     Fah-la-la-la-la,          
        la-la-la-la...         

590
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,257
        You know, Sammy,        

591
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,042
         I don't want to be     
         ungrateful or anything,

592
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:33,011
                but this soap   
                sucks wind.     
( <i>chuckles</i> )                    

593
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:37,248
          You bought Miss Humbug
          diamond earrings.     

594
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:39,684
Oh, come on now.                
There was a reason              
for that, though.               

595
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:43,254
She has invited me over for     
an intimate late-night supper.  

596
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:44,555
( <i>chuckles</i> )                    
                Yeah, you, me   

597
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,524
             and half the people
             in this bar.       

598
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:48,392
     Fah-la-la-la-la,          
        la-la-la-la...         

599
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:49,728
Don't kid around                
with me now.                    

600
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:52,497
I'm in far too fragile          
a condition.                    

601
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:54,999
    You mean you thought you    
    were gonna be the <i>only...</i>   

602
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,769
                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

603
00:22:57,803 --> 00:22:59,788
        You know, I wasn't too  
        thrilled about the soap,

604
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:01,790
    but this makes up for it.   

605
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,559
         Fah-la-la-la-la,      
        la-la-la-la...         

606
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:06,861
 Hey, look-- <i>It's</i>               
 <i>a Wonderful Life</i>               
<i> is on again</i>                    

607
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:08,430
and it's the very best part.    

608
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:11,733
        Turn it up, Sam.        

609
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:18,206
 Should old acquaintance       
be forgot and never...         

610
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,358
         Well, I'm glad I can   
         finally say this to you

611
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:22,027
             without having     
             my head bitten off.

612
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:23,895
    Merry Christmas, Frasier.   

613
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:25,797
    It is, isn't it?            

614
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:28,033
We have everything              
that matters,                   

615
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:31,435
we're together, our loved ones  
are safe and happy...           

616
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,805
          NEWSCASTER:           
 This just in to our news room. 

617
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,257
    Boston Airport has been     
    temporarily closed          

618
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,528
      due to the presence       
 of a berserk man on Runway Six 

619
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:41,763
 chasing an Orlando-bound plane 

620
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:46,935
and throwing what appears       
  to be cans of Chinese food.   

621
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:49,337
Stay tuned for further details. 

622
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,338
       ...lang syne...         

623
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:53,875
  Oh, Cliffy, Cliff, Cliff...   

624
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,513
( <i>singing along with TV</i> )       
       We'll drink a cup       
    of kindness yet            

625
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:05,370
     For auld lang syne.
