00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,051
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:06,921
Hi, Miss Howe.

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,156
Hi, Kelly.

4
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:11,376
This... is for you.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,411
For me?

6
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,279
What is it?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,314
(gasps)

8
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,751
Oh, Kelly, this is beautiful.

9
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,169
Why me?

10
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,405
Because I like you and you've
always shown me friendship.

11
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:25,508
Well, that's sweet, Kelly.

12
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,175
Thank you.

13
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,678
And I want you to keep
your hands off my man.

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,049
Do we understand each other?

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,283
Not really.
(laughs)

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,119
Don't play dumb with me,
Miss Howe.

17
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,454
I invented it.

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,775
You know, Woody tells me
how you look at him.

19
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,126
Kelly, I don't look at him.

20
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,528
I know you do, Miss Howe,

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,081
and I'm prepared to buy you
one of these every month

22
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,750
if you keep away from my Woody.

23
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,957
Well, you know, Kelly,
he is awfully cute.

24
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,358
All right, one a week.

25
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:02,594
Do we have a deal?
Deal.

26
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,015
Do you know where Carla is?

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,868

A Scotch, please, Sam.

44
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:26,644
And how about a beer
for my friend Norm there?

45
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,929
Thank you, Fras.

46
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,814
You're certainly in
a chipper mood today.

47
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,866
And why not?
It's a beautiful day.

48
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:32,767
Yeah, good for you.

49
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:33,934
You know, it's amazing

50
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,225
how fast you've gotten
over your separation.

51
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,507
Well, a healthy mental
attitude- that's my secret.

52
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,542
Without that, you're nothing.

53
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,110
Ah, that's great, that's great.

54
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,129
You're completely over Lilith.

55
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,798
I'm sorry, who?

56
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,751
Lilith, your wife.

57
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:51,719
Never heard of the slut.

58
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:53,504
(door opens)

59
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,356
Big news, everybody.

60
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:58,093
Put down your beer mugs
and hold on to your barstools.

61
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,477
Me and Ma just got
a new neighbour,

62
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,012
moved into our
apartment building...

63
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,047
little guy,
about a hundred years old,

64
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,600
up from South America,
thick German accent,

65
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,769
little moustache
right about here.

66
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,188
Likes to paint.

67
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,333
I think you know
where I'm going with this.

68
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,443
Sweet Lord, I'll bet I do.

69
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,013
Yep, Adolf Hitler is living
in my apartment building.

70
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:22,651
Cliff, I don't even know
why I have to tell you this,

71
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,218
but Hitler is dead.

72
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,721
He died at the end of World
War II in that bunker.

73
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:27,706
Oh, yeah, really?

74
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,973
Were you at the bunker?

75
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,638
Yeah, as a
matter of fact... Cliff,

76
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,329
throughout the years, we've
become accustomed to your...

77
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,931
oh, how shall
I delicately put this?...

78
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:39,467
uh... madness.

79
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,340
Now, for my own peace of mind,
please assure me

80
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,442
that you're not going
to march up to this man

81
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:49,877
and accuse him
of being der Führer.

82
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,680
No, my accusations won't come

83
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,382
until after I complete
my investigation.

84
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,202
The case will be rock solid,

85
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,720
and it'd better be.

86
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:01,056
I-I've been wrong
twice before, you know.

87
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,341
Sa-am.

88
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,893
Wha-at?

89
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,797
I haven't been down here
since the fire.

90
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,566
By the way,
when are you going to rebuild?

91
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,751
We have.

92
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,455
Oh, well, and it looks very...

93
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,357
The reason I'm down here

94
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,115
is, last night our refrigerator

95
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,226
went on the fritz,

96
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,211
leaving us with a hundred pounds
of mackerel,

97
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,781
which may
or may not have gone bad.

98
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,516
Now, not wanting to take
a chance with my customers,

99
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,401
I'm prepared

100
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,037
to offer a special
to your patrons.

101
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:36,307
All-you-can-eat for two dollars.

102
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,491
Oh, whoa, whoa,
wait a second here.

103
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,928
What makes you think my
customers want your rotten fish?

104
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,646
NORM:
W-W-W-Wait, Sammy, wa-wa-wait now.

105
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,799
Uh... let's just
say, Mr. Hill,

106
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,767
that this, this
fish has spoiled.

107
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,037
Uh, what would happen to us?

108
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,873
Oh, you could suffer
a variety of symptoms

109
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:55,043
ranging from nausea to death.

110
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,745
Two bucks, you say?

111
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,533
Fair enough.

112
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:10,125
Oh, good, my package from
Amityville has arrived.

113
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,926
Ah, Miss Tortelli.

114
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,595
Tell me, is that a new hairdo

115
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,864
or did someone toss a toaster
in your bathtub?

116
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,199
(chuckling)

117
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,734
What am I saying?

118
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,604
What would you be doing
in a bathtub?

119
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:26,975
Cleaning you out of the drain.

120
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,543
Yeasty oil slick.

121
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:30,779
Bladder polyp.

122
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,846
Manwich.

123
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,314
Perverted goat boy.

124
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,750
Sluttish mole.

125
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,551
7:00 tonight?

126
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:38,636
Make it 6:30.

127
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:45,026
That man is the foulest, most
disgusting, hideous creature

128
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,729
to ever walk the
face of this earth,

129
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,864
and he's all mine.

130
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,123
Well, I'm gonna head
up to Melville's,

131
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,675
see if they've got another
fish fry going today.

132
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,444
Hey, actually, Norm,

133
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,195
you ought to be
careful, you know.

134
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,847
I think you were
just lucky yesterday

135
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,449
that you didn't
get really sick.

136
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,051
Who said I didn't get sick?

137
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,922
(door opens)

138
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,825
Well, all right, everybody.

139
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,293
Drop what you're doing,

140
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,727
stop the presses.

141
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:20,712
Nobody's going to be making fun

142
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,714
of Cliff Clavin anymore.

143
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,548
That's for sure.

144
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,686
Look, what I found in the
trash of Mr. A. Hitler.

145
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,521
Behold, exhibit "A."

146
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,256
What's this, a check stub here?

147
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,125
It's a Social
Security check stub,

148
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,010
and it sickens me.

149
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,729
To think that we Americans
worked our fingers

150
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,846
to the bone

151
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:42,783
so Mr. Hitler could
have creamed corn.

152
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,403
A cereal box?

153
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,472
That's right, Paul,
it's a cereal box.

154
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,041
I guess we can
determine that...

155
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,944
Trix are for kids
and for der Führer.

156
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,863
Cliff, what is that thing?

157
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,982
This is the most sophisticated
and high-tech listening device

158
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:58,983
that money can buy.

159
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,117
Gentlemen,

160
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,371
say hello
to Mr. Ear.

161
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,340
Mr. Ear.

162
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,741
That's right, you see,
if I'm going to stop

163
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:07,976
the Fourth Reich from happening,

164
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:10,211
I have to know every move
that Hitler makes.

165
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,546
With this baby,

166
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,381
I can hear a pin drop
at 500 feet away.

167
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,534
See those two chicks up there?

168
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,187
I'll tell you exactly what
they're talking about.

169
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,758
They're talking about some
stupid-looking yutz holding a...

170
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,126
never mind.

171
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,779
All right.

172
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,449
Look, wish me luck, everybody.

173
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,851
If I'm not back in two hours,
call the Defence Department.

174
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:37,454
Tell them Hitler's alive and
living in my apartment building.

175
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:41,058
They know the address.

176
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:44,496
You know, Cliff's pulled
some pretty crazy stunts

177
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,330
through the years, but...

178
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:48,199
this is really starting
to get me worried.

179
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,835
Yeah, maybe Cliff is really
going over the edge here.

180
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:51,903
Gentlemen,

181
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,538
if I may be the voice
of reason,

182
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:54,806
what if it is Hitler?

183
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,774
(door opens)

184
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,592
Woody,

185
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,261
I heard every word you said.

186
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,096
Thanks for being
in my corner, pal.

187
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,568
I knew he was listening.

188
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:10,304
Now, when he snaps,
maybe he'll spare me.

189
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,408
Well, bad news, boys.

190
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,310
No fish fry at Melville's.

191
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,979
Apparently,
John Hill had a heart attack.

192
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,046
Oh, really?

193
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,865
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

194
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,949
Relax, Rebecca,

195
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,851
there'll be other fish fries.

196
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,719
It's okay.

197
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,704
Let's look at the
long view here.

198
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,372
I was talking about John Hill.

199
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,641
What hospital
is he in? Arlington.

200
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,042
Should we visit him
at the hospital?

201
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,744
Who wants to go?

202
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,230
Come on, you guys,
he's our neighbour.

203
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,383
We know him, we should see him
in the hospital.

204
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,602
Rebecca, it's not like he's
our best friend or anything.

205
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,819
Norm, that's not the point.

206
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,288
The point is, you have to
pretend to be nice to people.

207
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,099
That's what makes you
a good person.

208
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,479
Hello, yes, I want
to inquire about the status

209
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:54,481
of one of your patients-
Mr. John Allen Hill.

210
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,600
Oh, thank you.

211
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,751
That's great news.

212
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,919
Oh, thanks very much.

213
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,988
Whoa, thank God.

214
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:04,274
Dead, Sam?

215
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,359
No, he's not dead.

216
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,277
He's in stable condition.

217
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,181
That's a terrible
thing to say, Woody.

218
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,472
You're always acting
like you don't like him.

219
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,217
That doesn't mean I
wish he were dead.

220
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,252
Well, what about yesterday

221
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,020
when you said
"I wish he was dead"?

222
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,055
(door opens)

223
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,923
Hi, everybody.

224
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,708
Carla, what are you doing here?

225
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,595
Living my lifelong dream,

226
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,597
fulfilling all my fantasies.

227
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,232
I'm a cocktail waitress.

228
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,067
What do you think
I'm doing here?!

229
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:33,053
Sam, she doesn't know
about Hill yet.

230
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:35,523
What are we going to do?
This is going to crush her.

231
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,325
Oh, all right, I'll,
uh, I'll tell her.

232
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,427
Sam, news of this gravity
should be delivered

233
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,664
by someone who has
studied the human psyche

234
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,617
in great detail-
someone who has tact,

235
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:50,004
compassion, and an understanding
of the human heart.

236
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,739
Okay, Dr. Crane,
I'll do it,

237
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,374
but you've got to
deliver this martini.

238
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,110
Carla!

239
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:57,144
Woody.

240
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:58,129
What?

241
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,964
I was referring to myself.

242
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:03,284
Oh, right.

243
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,786
(muttering):
Calling Dr. Von Ego.

244
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,557
Carla, may I have
a word with you?

245
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:11,892
Sure.
Please, sit down.

246
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:17,898
What I'm about to tell you may
be a little difficult to hear.

247
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,717
Oh, my God.

248
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,536
And before I tell you what
it is, I just want you to know

249
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,888
that we are all your friends
and we support you.

250
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,841
What is it?

251
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,145
Carla, John Hill has
had a heart attack.

252
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,832
Oh, my God.

253
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,266
Hill had a heart attack?

254
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,820
John Allen Hill
had a heart attack?

255
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,189
(laughing):
That's what you were trying to tell me?

256
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,424
From the way you were acting,

257
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,126
I thought something
happened to my car.

258
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,267
Carla, you knew?

259
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,402
Of course I knew.

260
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,770
I'm the one
who called the ambulance.

261
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,437
Oh, well, then you were there.

262
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,039
W-W-What, what happened?

263
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,693
Well, Hill and I were in
the middle of doing it.

264
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:05,696
Next thing I know,

265
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,748
he's clutching his chest
and turning blue.

266
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,384
I took it as a compliment
till he fell to the floor.

267
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:15,823
So, uh, why didn't you go
with him to the hospital?

268
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,991
I hate hospitals.

269
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,227
I'll send him a card later
if I think of it.

270
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:20,411
Now, just a minute,
Carla, listen.

271
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,080
You've been seeing this man
for over a year now.

272
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,048
Don't you have
any feelings for him?

273
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:27,435
Listen, Doc, I've had
guys run out on me.

274
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,869
I had a husband die on me.

275
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:30,838
I got eight kids at
home to worry about.

276
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,140
I don't need to go getting
attached to some other guy

277
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,843
just because we sweat up
the sheets now and then.

278
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,032
I couldn't care
less about Hill.

279
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,801
You feel so strongly about
him, you go visit him.

280
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,938
You ready to order?

281
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,683
Uh, yes, we'd like a gin and
tonic with a lime, please,

282
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,509
a Diet Coke, a Manhattan up,

283
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:55,479
and we'll also need some
fresh pretzels and, and...

284
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,803
(crying)
I-Is there something wrong, Miss?

285
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:02,203
(sobbing):
My boyfriend's in the hospital.

286
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,116
I'm so ashamed.

287
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,201
I called Hill my boyfriend.

288
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,086
What's wrong with me?

289
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,755
FRASIER:
Carla,

290
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,540
you've come down
with a bad case

291
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,708
of humanity.

292
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,129
A malady characterized

293
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:30,631
by bouts of compassion,
warmth and caring.

294
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:32,834
I mean, who knows, this sort
of thing could go on

295
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,202
for the rest of your life.

296
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,837
Shut up, fathead!

297
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:40,708
Or it could pass
in a matter of seconds.

298
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,476
Everybody, just leave me alone.

299
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,312
You're making this
into something it's not.

300
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:49,116
Carla, you cannot hold something
like this inside of you.

301
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,934
PHIL:
Yeah, Carla,

302
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,288
I never shared how I feel
and now I'm old and all alone.

303
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,023
If there's one thing
I learned...

304
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,158
Hey, Phil, zip it!

305
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:01,578
Look, first of all,

306
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,581
I don't have any feelings
for that slug.

307
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,217
Second of all,
you never saw me cry.

308
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,886
Third, I'd like
to stay and chat

309
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,187
but I've got work to do.

310
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,355
Sam, I want to talk
to you in the office.

311
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,944
Oh, I don't, I don't
want to hear

312
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:18,662
about her relationship
with John Hill.

313
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:20,932
I don't understand what they do
when they get together anyway,

314
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,333
and I don't want to.

315
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,802
I wish there was some way
I could get out of this.

316
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,006
Well, why don't you
just wish she was dead?

317
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,915
Hey.

318
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,250
How ya doin', huh?

319
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,918
Oh, Sam.

320
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,120
Hill's in the hospital
and it's all my fault.

321
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,789
Naw, see, now you can't
blame yourself for that.

322
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,675
Oh, but it's true.

323
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,677
You see,

324
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:52,680
last night started out
as just an average date.

325
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:55,683
Hill and I getting it
on hot and heavy.

326
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:58,185
I'm cursing at him,
he's cursing at me...

327
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,053
some real beauties.

328
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,423
The headboard was
begging for mercy.

329
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,059
Do me a favour
and just cut the chase.

330
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:08,229
Unless there was a chase
and- oh, God, no.

331
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,197
Uh...

332
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,801
I'm a little...
Okay. Okay.

333
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:16,804
Just before he keeled over,

334
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,973
I went over the line.

335
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,742
I said something so awful, I...

336
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,811
I can't even repeat it.

337
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,831
Oh, honey.

338
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,666
Well, what'd you say?

339
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,571
(mumbling)

340
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,390
I'm sorry, what?

341
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,477
(clears throat)

342
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,512
I told him I loved him.

343
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,180
And that's...

344
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,016
and that's bad,
right? Of course.

345
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,351
Uh-huh.

346
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,520
Of course that's bad!

347
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,688
Mm.

348
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,223
Sam, you don't get this, do you?

349
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,158
Look,

350
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:57,094
Hill and I have a very
simple relationship.

351
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:59,430
I don't like him,
he doesn't like me,

352
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:00,998
we get it on.

353
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,951
Now, if we start saying
we like each other,

354
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,953
we're gonna screw up
what we had.

355
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,455
And then I'm gonna lose him

356
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:09,957
and I don't want to lose him,
'cause I care for him.

357
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,925
(gasps) What is with me?!

358
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,395
I'm, I'm getting lost here.

359
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,863
Do-do you like this guy
or not?

360
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:16,998
Of course I do.

361
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,082
But I can't tell him.

362
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,300
Why not?

363
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,400
Because if I tell him,

364
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,269
then he won't have
anything to do with me.

365
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,570
Just like if he told me,

366
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,594
I wouldn't have anything
to do with him.

367
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:28,408
Oh, all right, all right,
all right, I see.

368
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,410
So-so you're saying...

369
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:31,645
shoot!

370
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,613
I almost had it.

371
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,790
I guess there's only
one thing I can do.

372
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,291
I've gotta go to the hospital

373
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,893
and straighten
things out. Yes! Yes!

374
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,561
That's it! You've gotta
go to the hospital,

375
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:49,596
and no matter how much
it costs you...

376
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,980
you've gotta tell the guy
that you care for him.

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,417
No, Sam.

378
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,118
I have to go and tell him

379
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,087
that I don't care
for him. Right!

380
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,438
Right! I was gonna
say that next.

381
00:15:58,439 --> 00:15:59,807
You gotta go and tell him

382
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,675
that you don't care for him.

383
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,643
Right. Okay.

384
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,516
All right.

385
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:14,238
Who wants to know
what Hitler watches on TV?

386
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,975
Cliff, I'm not gonna
play this stupid game anymore.

387
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,112
Hitler does not live in
your apartment building.

388
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,697
All right, from 1500 hours
to 1530 hours,

389
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:25,332
he watched The Flintstones.

390
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,585
Instead of Gilligan's Island?

391
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,352
Well, he is a mad man.

392
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,207
From 1530 hours to 1600
he watched People's Court.

393
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:36,043
How ironic.

394
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,477
At 1630 hours,

395
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,680
he clapped off the TV
and went to bed.

396
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,766
Oh, my God, Norm!

397
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:43,850
It's him.
Hide me.

398
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,402
This is the guy
you thought was Hitler?

399
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,537
No, no, worse!

400
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,139
It's my landlord,
Mr. Cranston.

401
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,974
Clavin, don't you try
to hide from me!

402
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,526
I'm here to inform you

403
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,528
we held a tenants
meeting last night.

404
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,297
Uh, I wasn't invited.

405
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,732
We never invite you
when it's about you.

406
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,400
Was Hitler there?

407
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:01,701
Yes, Hitler was there...

408
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,820
or Mr. O'Leary

409
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:05,955
as he's known to us
on Planet Earth.

410
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,159
Yeah, what was the
meeting about?

411
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,911
Well, I intended
to have you evicted.

412
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:13,246
You've done some strange things
in your time, Clavin,

413
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,715
but this is the worst!

414
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,550
You're harassing an old man!

415
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,552
Who may well be the most hated

416
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:20,087
and feared figure of the
Twentieth Century.

417
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,556
Well, at least he's not
one of those noisy teens.

418
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,324
Well, that's true.

419
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:25,960
As I was saying,

420
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,261
I was gonna boot you out,

421
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,880
but your mother made a stirring
speech in your defence.

422
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,683
By the time she finished reading
that passage from the Bible,

423
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,685
we were all in tears.

424
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,854
Even Hitler?

425
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,188
Even Hitler.

426
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:41,025
Oh, Mr. O'Leary.

427
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,193
Now I will allow you to stay,

428
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,528
if you apologize to him

429
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,564
and promise not to pursue
this matter any further.

430
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,965
Now do I have your word?

431
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,700
Yeah, okay. I promise.

432
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,402
So just don't boot us
out, all right?

433
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,502
Agreed.

434
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:53,670
Well, thank you.

435
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:54,838
You know, I-I know

436
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,106
I get out of hand occasionally.

437
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,274
I've got all this
pent-up energy,

438
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,441
a lot of time on my hands.

439
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,077
You know, uh, I'm
Civil Service.

440
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:01,411
Well, that explains it.

441
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:03,798
I will let you off with a
warning this time, Clavin.

442
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,584
Does this mean I can go back
in the laundry room?

443
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,402
No. That's a whole
separate thing.

444
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,473
Hmm.

445
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,476
Well, Cliff, you've
tormented an elderly man,

446
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,160
you got everyone in your
apartment building angry,

447
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,147
and you almost lost your home.

448
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:23,384
Now, are you clear
on what this means?

449
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,319
Sure.

450
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,721
Hitler brainwashed my landlord.

451
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,535
Hill!

452
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,688
Miss Tortelli!

453
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,106
These are for you.

454
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,941
Oh, what a thoughtful purchase.

455
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,443
I didn't buy 'em.

456
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,978
I got 'em out of a
room down the hall.

457
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:54,048
The guy won't be needing
'em where he's going.

458
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,849
Has he been discharged?

459
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,017
You might say.

460
00:18:57,018 --> 00:19:00,187
If you ever need a
pair of slippers,

461
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,655
size 11, let me know.

462
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:03,157
Oh, thank you.

463
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,025
Frankly, Miss Tortelli,

464
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,693
I don't know why you're here.

465
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,195
My doctor informs me

466
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:10,531
I have to remain celibate
for the next eight weeks.

467
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,616
Hey, don't insult me, Hill!

468
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,118
You think that sex is
all I have on my mind?

469
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,354
There are other facets
to my personality.

470
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,090
Eight weeks?

471
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,078
Well, anyway, look,

472
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,481
I just came here because
I wanted to apologize.

473
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:30,467
Last night, before
this happened,

474
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,770
I said this thing to you,

475
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,572
and, um,

476
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,508
I just wanted you to know that

477
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,410
this thing I said-
eight weeks?!

478
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,813
Please continue, Miss Tortelli.

479
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,785
Anyway, about this thing
that I said,

480
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,153
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't mean it.

481
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:52,372
Hill,

482
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,525
do you remember what thing it is
I'm talking about?

483
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,412
I must confess it rings
a faint bell...

484
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,747
that thing.

485
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,649
Well, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry,

486
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,952
because I think it's
probably what caused your heart attack.

487
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,922
It was quite a shock.

488
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:10,258
I don't think anyone's
ever said it to me before.

489
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,758
No one?

490
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,093
Not even your daughter?

491
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,995
Well, it never really came up.

492
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,918
You had a wife.

493
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,853
Well, she and I...

494
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,055
had an understanding.

495
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,375
Your parents?

496
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,495
The point is, Miss Tortelli,

497
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,765
I'm not exactly a cuddle bear.

498
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,618
Yeah, well, neither am I.

499
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,002
See you around.

500
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,171
Uh, uh, one moment,
Miss Tortelli.

501
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,206
Yeah.

502
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,843
Perhaps the diuretic is making
me sentimental, but, uh...

503
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,798
what do you suppose
would happen

504
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,666
if we were foolhardy
enough to attempt

505
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,135
to take our relationship
to the next plateau?

506
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:57,705
Hypothetically, of course.

507
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,641
Yeah, well,

508
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02,609
I have thought
about that a little bit.

509
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:05,979
I'm not proud of it,
but I've thought of it.

510
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,114
After all, we have
eight celibate weeks

511
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:10,200
in which to get to know
each other better.

512
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,119
Okay, I'm game.

513
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,425
Uh, so, uh,

514
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,527
Miss Tortelli.

515
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,862
Carla.

516
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,147
Oh, Carla!

517
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:28,769
Carla- that's a pretty name.

518
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,153
Thank you.

519
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,208
So, uh,

520
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,443
you, uh, you have any children?

521
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:42,198
No.

522
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,855
So, uh, what's it like
running a restaurant?

523
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,556
Well, you know, a lot of work,

524
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,224
but, uh, very rewarding.

525
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:52,393
Oh, that's good.

526
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,327
I mean that is rewarding.

527
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:57,314
Because there are a lot of jobs
that aren't rewarding,

528
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,449
and it's good
that you found a job

529
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,651
that is rewarding.

530
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,037
Carla, could you please
do me a small favour?

531
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,472
Yes, John.

532
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:07,458
Could you work yourself
behind this machinery

533
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,392
and unplug my life-support
system

534
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,094
so that I can leave this life

535
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,931
and this agonizing
conversation behind?

536
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,517
Oh, like it was fun
for me, zit face!

537
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,851
Sasquatch.

538
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,019
Road kill.

539
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:20,854
Catcher's mitt.
Pond scum.

540
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:21,955
Phlegm face.

541
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,156
See you in eight weeks?

542
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:24,792
Make it four.
Make it two.

543
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,494
Pull the curtain.
