1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,637
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,591
Woody, let me have
a C.C., rocks...

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,396
Something with a twist and whatever
else table ten was drinking.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,034
Boy, your batteries
are running low there, Carla.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,638
I got two sick kids,
kept me up half the night.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,032
The neighbour's dog went into heat
at 5:00 this morning.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,839
And I am in the middle
of a double shift here.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,753
Well, on the bright side,
you look like hell.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,352
Oh, dear. I think this calls
for drastic measures.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,676
- G-6?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,559
Oh, no. Not G-6.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,155
And leave it off.

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,512
Good lord, Sam,

14
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,275
have you been swimming laps
in that cologne of yours?

15
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,910
No, I just dropped the bottle
all over the floor in there.

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,795
Another $2.50 down the drain.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,751
Oh, the big bottle.

18
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,909
Hey. Look, The Three Musketeers
is coming on in ten minutes.

19
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,548
- All right.
- Oh, good for you two.

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,119
Excellent choice.

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,034
Of course, there's no substitution
for the Dumas pÃ¨re novel.

22
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,317
But all in all it wasn't
a bad translation into film.

23
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,440
You better believe it.
I love all that duelling.

24
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,955
Yeah, and the best part
is when Curly

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,237
backs into that guard's sword
and makes that "boing" sound.

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,759
What makes me think we're
not talking about the same film?

27
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,912
- She probably likes Shemp.
- Right.

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,550
Is it possible that occasionally
you people might spend an afternoon

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,474
doing something that actually
involves intelligent thought?

30
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,108
- Like what?
- I can't conceive.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,238
And we can all breathe
a sigh of relief for that.

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,552
Actually, just observing people
can be very interesting.

33
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,076
Don't you ever make up little stories
about the people you see in the bar?

34
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,037
Nope.

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,510
Well, for example,
this couple over here.

36
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,159
What's their story?

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,196
That's a guy and a girl
having a drink. Fascinating.

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,512
Come on, you can do better than that.
Just use a little imagination.

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,036
Okay, that's a guy...

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,112
...and a naked girl having a drink.

41
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,713
That's funny, right?

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,388
No kidding, fellas.
That was really nifty.

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,232
I appreciate you taking me.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,277
Where did they take you, Woody?

45
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,512
Well, we watched the
Greater Boston Women's 1 0K run.

46
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,039
I should've known.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,111
No, now wait a minute.
Hold on there, Diane.

48
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,554
We happen to think it's inspiring

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,472
to watch a bunch of women
excel in a sport

50
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,677
from which only until recently
they've been barred from competing.

51
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,314
Well, I'm sorry, Clifford.
I guess I misjudged you.

52
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,356
Besides, there wasn't
a bra on the field.

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,035
It was an awfully chilly morning,
if you know what I mean.

54
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,075
More coffee for Chuckles.

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,793
Who?

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,269
That guy over there.

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,112
Haven't you noticed him?

58
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,151
He's been sitting there
for a couple hours

59
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,995
drinking coffee and staring at us.

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,838
So, what's the problem?

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,952
I'll tell you what's the problem.
He doesn't smile. He doesn't talk.

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,270
He looks at me like I'm not there.

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,000
You'd think I'd slept with him
or something.

64
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,156
So what?
He's not bothering anyone.

65
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,839
He's bothering me.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,514
He gives me the creeps.

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,111
Look. See that?
He's writing something down.

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,111
- Now, what do you think he's up to?
- Come on.

69
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,236
For all we know,
he's writing down a shopping list.

70
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,876
Well, here's the perfect chance
for us to play our little game.

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,031
Oh, yeah? What game's that?

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,069
Well, we were just fantasizing
about customers in the bar,

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,878
making up little stories about them.
Two beers, Woody.

74
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,197
Well, he's probably a writer
or a poet or something.

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,753
Oh, that's very good.

76
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,269
What do you think
he's writing, Woody?

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,874
Well, I hope he's not writing
about a boy and his dog

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,192
who roam through the countryside
doing good deeds and drinking beer.

79
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,834
Why?

80
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,951
Because that's the story I'm writing.

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,311
He's still looking at us.

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
So, what's the big deal? As long
as he's minding his own business.

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,990
That's just it, Sam.
He's not minding his own business.

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,232
It's like he's spying on us.

85
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,230
See that? He just wrote
something else down.

86
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,351
There's an easy way
to figure out what he's up to.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,954
- Somebody just go ask him.
- Oh, let me.

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,838
All right.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,436
I'm from the Midwest, and we have
kind of a down-home charm

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,036
that makes people
kind of open up to us.

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,314
Howdy. I'm Woody Boyd
from Hanover, lndiana.

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,790
That's the place mat capitol
of the world.

93
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,233
My mother's name's Margaret
and my father's name's Edgel.

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,829
My favourite colour is blue
and I've saved all my baby teeth.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,991
How about you?

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,915
Go away.

97
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,798
What'd you find out?

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,197
I've lived kind of a dull life.

99
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,760
Look, what's he doing now?

100
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,190
I'd say he's fixing a cigarette lighter
of some sort.

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,716
Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps
to the terminally naive.

102
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,232
Those of us in the know can spot

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,995
a highly sensitive
Rolleiflex espionage camera.

104
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,397
Yep. Yeah, look, he's taking pictures
of us right now.

105
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,629
Oh, come on, man.

106
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,109
Just because he looks
like a spy and acts like a spy,

107
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,396
it doesn't mean he is a spy, does it?

108
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,068
I think it pretty much does, Sam.

109
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,073
Well, it certainly isn't unheard of

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,391
for an individual to come
under some sort of surveillance.

111
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,959
As soon as you get into a computer

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,838
hundreds of organizations
have information

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,389
about every aspect
of your personal life.

114
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,437
- Wow, really?
- Yes.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,229
In fact, you could be bugged
right now.

116
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,915
Well, now that you mention it,
I am a little ticked, but I guess...

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,511
You don't suppose
this guy's with, like, the ClA

118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,989
- or FBl or anything, do you?
- Could be.

119
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,718
Or he may be...

120
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,552
All right, I'll say it.

121
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,757
He may be with the KGB.

122
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,916
Come to think of it,
this guy does kind of have

123
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,877
a detective look about him.

124
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,315
All right, let's go over the four things
we know about him:

125
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,152
He's been here since we opened,

126
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,279
he's not drinking,
he's not waiting for a table upstairs.

127
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,954
Actually, that's only three.
Anybody else know anything?

128
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,310
You're an idiot.

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,397
That would be four then.

130
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,231
You know, if he's a detective,
he's obviously after one of us.

131
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,039
If it was anyone else, he would've
followed them right out the door.

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,270
We're the only ones who have
been here the whole time he has.

133
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,038
Look, I got an idea.

134
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,555
I'm gonna go call him
on the phone and distract him.

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,110
Cliff, you go see what he's been
writing about us, and don't get caught.

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,799
Oh, no, don't worry about that.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,991
Even if he does,
he won't get anything out of me.

138
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,191
You don't know anything.

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,313
Cheers.

140
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,673
Yeah, who may--?
Who may I say is calling?

141
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,028
Excuse me, sir, phone for you.

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,714
- Who is it?
- They didn't say.

143
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,510
Take a number.

144
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,676
Five.

145
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,557
Oh, they hung up. Probably call back.

146
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,638
Man.

147
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,035
He didn't even take a phone call.
This is getting weird.

148
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,118
All right. Look, we gotta go to
some private place and have a huddle.

149
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,390
All right, how about my office.

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,068
Sam, aren't you forgetting
about your cologne?

151
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,199
Come on, would you?
It's had all day to wear off.

152
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,358
Okay. We'll give it
a few more minutes.

153
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,875
The ladies' room. He's never
gonna walk in on us there.

154
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,799
Don't you think that'll look
a little weird?

155
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,919
Well, not if we go in one at a time
so he doesn't notice.

156
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,356
Woody, cover the bar.

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,039
I think we could've spaced it out
a little better.

158
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,155
Okay, if anybody here

159
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,515
knows any reason
why their personal conduct

160
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,240
should be coming
under investigation,

161
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,995
I hope they have enough hormones
to step forward and say so.

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,759
Okay.

163
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,797
Okay.

164
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,110
I'll bet it's Woody.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,991
Come on, man. That's crazy.

166
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,269
Why, Sam?

167
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,638
The fact that he's not here to defend
himself makes him the perfect choice.

168
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,559
Well, yeah, there's that.

169
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,994
But, also...

170
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,752
Well, what do we know
about Woody, huh?

171
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,036
I mean, he comes in here
off the street out of nowhere.

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,670
Sam gives him a job.
No rÃ©sumÃ©, no nothing, huh?

173
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,476
For all we know, he could be
in cahoots with that guy.

174
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,756
I say Woody's a plant.

175
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,192
Only from the neck up.

176
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,791
Come on, Cliff.

177
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,872
Think about it. Woody? I mean,
you're a little off base here, pal.

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,234
- Oh, am l?
- Yeah.

179
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,110
Well, he just might've infiltrated
the bar to keep tabs on you, Norm.

180
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,714
Me? What for?

181
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,956
Oh, he's just saying you
hypothetically.

182
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,953
- Well.
- Not really.

183
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,038
What's that supposed
to mean, Cliff?

184
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,316
Think I'm some sort of
crooked accountant, is that it?

185
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,914
No, no, no, Norm. I'm just...

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,594
...postulating the possibility there
that the lRS

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,955
might think your accounting's
a little creative.

188
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,991
Oh, yeah? Creative, huh?

189
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,151
I say the guy might be
a postal investigator, Cliff.

190
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,471
You haven't bought a stamp
since the Johnson administration.

191
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,200
And I'm talking about Andrew, pal.
Andrew Johnson.

192
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,909
Take that back right now.
I've been a postman for 1 1 years.

193
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,389
- Relax. Take it easy.
- Oh, sure, relax.

194
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,238
From
Mr Love-Them-and-Leave-Them here.

195
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,789
For all we know, he's sniffing out
a paternity suit on you.

196
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,279
Oh, come on.

197
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,315
I think we might be getting
a little carried away.

198
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,752
And this from the woman
who toured Europe on her back.

199
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,119
That's it. That's it!

200
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,595
The guy's upsetting my customers
and my business.

201
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,069
I'm gonna go find out
what he's doing.

202
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,389
Sam.

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,115
Sam.

204
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,269
Please.

205
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,756
I know. I know.
You guys are trying to talk me out

206
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,512
of making those charitable
contributions,

207
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,318
but somebody's gotta do it.

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,189
Hey, buddy...

209
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,396
Listen, what's your story here?

210
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,028
- You come in here and you--
- Sam.

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,792
He's a friend of mine.

212
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,194
- You know this guy?
- Yes.

213
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,396
Thank you, lrving.
You may leave now.

214
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,518
- Sure. See you in class.
- Okay.

215
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,309
We went zooey
over a guy named lrving?

216
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,151
He's a member
of my psychology class.

217
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,314
He's assisting me in a little
experiment about paranoia.

218
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,994
What do you mean, "experiment"?

219
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,273
Well, the idea was to introduce
a foreign element into an established,

220
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,432
secure environment in order
to observe the ensuing behaviour.

221
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,957
I, for one, found it extremely
interesting and highly educational.

222
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,119
Didn't all of you find it extremely
interesting and highly educational?

223
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,630
Anybody?

224
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,390
Oh, come on. Don't get mad.

225
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,788
It's silly to get mad.

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,118
Diane, we don't get mad.

227
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,750
Pardon me, Diane.

228
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,316
Excuse me, is there anything
on my back, like a "kick me" sign?

229
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,278
- No.
- Thank you.

230
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,231
For several days I've been expecting
the people here to get back at me

231
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,197
for something I did.

232
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,719
I brought a man in...

233
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,518
Wait a minute.
Why are you so curious?

234
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,111
Just do your crossword
and mind your own beeswax.

235
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,635
Oh, hey, Miss Chambers.

236
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,951
I stopped into the bakery on the way
in to work and I got some muffins.

237
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,270
Would you like one?

238
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,238
Oh, here it is. Muffins?

239
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,954
Yeah, blueberry or bran.
Which one do you want?

240
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,714
Which one do you want, Woody?

241
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,870
I'll take the blueberry, I think.

242
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,514
No, no. I'll take the blueberry.

243
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,193
Okay.

244
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,268
Wait.

245
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,319
It's okay with you that I take
the blueberry? Then I want the bran.

246
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,755
Sure, Miss Chambers. Enjoy it.

247
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,478
I just love the feel of warm muffins
in the morning.

248
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,712
You a little nervous or something?

249
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,394
Me, nervous? I'm not nervous.
I'm not a bit nervous.

250
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,750
I'm positively placid.

251
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,672
- Hello, everyone.
- Oh, Frasier.

252
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,274
Thank God you're here.
What took you so long?

253
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,873
I came as soon as I got
your message.

254
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,517
- Well, I called your office hours ago.
- Well, I'd stepped out to Denver.

255
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,716
Well, if I'd known
you were out of town

256
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,632
I would never have expected you
to come here.

257
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,872
Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly. Listen,
I was fed up with Denver anyway.

258
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,640
Breathtaking mountains,
wide-open spaces,

259
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,951
that hauntingly beautiful woman that
kept coming onto me in the ski lodge.

260
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,839
Oh, good. Well, as long as
you're here, I wanna talk with you.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,389
Woody, there's a little bit
under that chair.

262
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,989
Diane, I've dreamed of this day.

263
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,918
Oh, Frasier.

264
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,674
I hope you didn't misinterpret
my message

265
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,638
as a wish to rekindle our romance.

266
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,677
No, of course not.

267
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,478
This is Tuesday, right?

268
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,952
When I said I dreamed of this day,
I meant I dreamt of Tuesday.

269
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,958
Listen, I am very proud of the fact
that I am completely over you.

270
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,270
Now, what is it?

271
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,318
Well, the other day
I was conducting an experiment

272
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,789
for my Behavioural Sciences
Colloquium.

273
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,316
- I brought a man in.
- Man. What man?

274
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,550
A classmate. Oh, never mind.

275
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,154
The point is that I played
this harmless trick on them,

276
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,878
and now they're going
to get back at me.

277
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,191
At first I approached it
with my usual good humour,

278
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,830
but now I find I'm obsessed.
I need your help.

279
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,315
Well, I think one or two sessions
should clear it up.

280
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,116
Oh, Frasier, I don't want counselling.
I want you to spy on them.

281
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,274
Get close to them. Find out what
heinous revenge they have planned--!

282
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,429
Diane, look at yourself.

283
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,114
No wonder you're such easy fodder
for their little pranks.

284
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,238
Look, the problem is
you take everything so seriously.

285
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,597
Take it from me, who used to do
the same thing, it's not worth it.

286
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,638
I'm much happier now
that I let things bounce off of me.

287
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,349
Now that I'm happy-go-lucky
Frasier Crane.

288
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,710
Frasier, you're right.
I do take things too seriously.

289
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,996
I need to lighten up a little.

290
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,111
Great. Now that we've
taken care of that,

291
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,317
do you think there's any chance
that you'll ever love me again

292
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,994
before I lie mouldering in the grave?

293
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,636
Oh, I'm joking, of course.

294
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,679
It's just another example
of my devil-may-care attitude.

295
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,233
Well, you've been a big help.
Thank you.

296
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,994
Diane, there's somebody
here who wants to talk to you.

297
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,959
- Yes?
- Miss Chambers,

298
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,033
I'm Martin Gallagher, WLBD,
public broadcasting.

299
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,239
One of your professors at the
university sent us some of your poetry.

300
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,476
And we thought you'd make
a wonderful guest

301
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,076
for our program,
Boston's Working Poets.

302
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,309
- Really?
- Yes.

303
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,277
- You want me to appear on television?
- Yes.

304
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,590
- Well, I'm honoured.
- Well, you should be.

305
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,558
- lsn't that great?
- Oh, yes, it's really...

306
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,151
...unbelievable.

307
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,595
Why don't you tell me
a bit more about your show.

308
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,917
Well, the concept is part-time poets

309
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,356
in their working habitat
reading their own verse.

310
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,915
- Won't that be exciting?
- Why, yes.

311
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,719
Little old me on television.
My, my, my.

312
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,509
- Well, when do we get started?
- Well, would right now be all right?

313
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,314
Your Mr. Malone
has kindly offered his poolroom.

314
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,072
Well, wasn't that nice of him?

315
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,071
I guess right now would be perfect,
wouldn't it?

316
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,549
- Well, good.
- Let me show you where to set up.

317
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,108
So nice of you to drop by Cheers
where I serve the public many beers.

318
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,072
This is it.

319
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,269
Are you sure?

320
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,237
I doubt if the collective intelligence
of them

321
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,868
could devise
this complicated a ruse.

322
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,314
I'm absolutely sure.

323
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,552
They expect me to give
a sensitive rendition of my poetry.

324
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,119
And then at some future date

325
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,955
they'll play it back while they swill beer
and throw spitwads at the screen

326
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,759
and make unpleasant animal noises.

327
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,117
Well, I'm not going to fall for it.

328
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,070
- I have a little surprise for them.
- Now, that's the spirit.

329
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,231
Oh, Diane, what a couple
we'd have made.

330
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,039
Two irrepressible zanies.

331
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,272
Wow, Miss Chambers, what kind
of poetry are you gonna recite?

332
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,238
You too, Woody.

333
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,838
Oh, what a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive.

334
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,952
Well, I hate to burst your bubble,
but I've heard that before.

335
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,468
- We're ready for you, Miss Chambers.
- Yes, I'm sure you are.

336
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,871
- And I'm ready for you.
- Good. You just stand over here.

337
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,753
Aren't you going to give me
a clever introduction?

338
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,273
Oh, we'll dub that in later.

339
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,155
- Oh, why didn't I think of that?
- And roll camera.

340
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,869
As soon as you're ready,
Miss Chambers, just begin.

341
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,115
Well, I would like to begin
with one of my favourites,

342
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,957
and I hope you'll like it too.
It's called "Ode to a Cornish Hen."

343
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,275
Sam, if you have an ounce
of humanity, turn that off.

344
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,592
What did you think
you were doing up there?

345
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,552
- I didn't think it was a real show.
- Are you kidding me?

346
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,439
I mean, who would make up
something that boring?

347
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,758
Well, I thought you did.

348
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,315
I thought it was a joke.

349
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,869
I figured that you set it up
to get back at me

350
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,032
because of my psychology
experiment.

351
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,717
What a great joke.
I wish we had thought of that.

352
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,189
I can't think of it now.

353
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,516
I made an absolute ass of myself.

354
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,990
Oh, come on, Diane. Lighten up.
It wasn't that bad. It really wasn't.

355
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,909
Heck, no. I've known chickens
who can't do that as well as you.

356
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,911
Hey, hey, come on.
It's no big deal.

357
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,672
Nobody watches that stuff.

358
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,074
It's not just the show.

359
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,830
After I filmed that thing,
I felt kind of good

360
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,070
thinking that you guys
had gone to all that trouble

361
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,676
to get back at me
like you would with each other.

362
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,273
And I was thinking of myself
as one of the gang,

363
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,398
and now I don't know whether
I'm more disappointed at that

364
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,039
awful display on television

365
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,589
or the fact that you still
think of me as an outsider.

366
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,995
Oh, boy.

367
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,879
I'm sorry if...
I don't know what to say...

368
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,955
Go into my place, lie down.
Take as much time as you want.

369
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,351
- Feel better.
- Thank you, Sam.

370
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,997
I love you guys!
