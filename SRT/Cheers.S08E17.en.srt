the tire distributor   
         from rhode island?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,279
Look, lady, if you've got      
 problems with your wheels,

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,914
talk to your dealer.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,316
I'm carla.

7
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,251
Remember? We went out   
        a couple of times.

8
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,553
It must've              
        been years ago.

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,771
I'm sorry.              
        I don't remember.

10
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:23,854
Yeah, i guess           
        it's been a while.

11
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:27,024
You were still         
         pushing whitewalls.

12
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,893
Maybe this'll jog   
            your memory.

Art's hideaway

00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:32,964
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,967
Look, in the tire game,        
 you meet a lot of women.

16
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,255
Yeah, but you can't        
     have forgotten.

Mirror on the ceiling?

18

No.

00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,664
The trick              
         with the tie?

22
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:51,115
That was you?

23
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:52,550
Yeah.

24
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:56,004
Oh, god,                   
     that was one steamy night. 
     Wasn't it, phil?

00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:57,589

 sweetheart?

     some hick dive in texas

specializing in     
            fillet au armadillo

54
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,209
has gone belly-up,

55
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,646
so they want to stick us   
     with the one piece         
     of equipment

56
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,497
that they couldn't seem 
        to liquidate.

57
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:48,332
Oh, i hope it's                
 a mesquite grill.

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,670
Then i could make              
 a mess of aunt lou's           
 baby back ribs.

59
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,072
It is not                  
     a mesquite grill, woody.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,374
It's a mechanical bull.

61
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,442
Well, it's just as well.

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,513
Aunt lou's ribs                
 weren't all that good.

63
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,583
Come to think of it,           
 she choked                     
 on one of them.

64
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,301
Just her luck

65
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:10,422
it was a week before           
 the heimlich maneuver          
 came out.

66
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,526
Well, i have to say,

67
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:17,128
those mechanical bulls     
     are like the most useless  
     thing ever put in a bar.

68
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:18,530
Now, now, norm.

69
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,932
Ok. Present company 
            excepted, ok?

70
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,102
Thank you, norm.

71
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,504
You know, i don't know.

72
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:29,140
I think there may be a place   
 for a mechanical bull

73
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,343
in our recreational 
            schemata.

74
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,595
It does, after all,            
 provide modern man

75
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,430
with a socially                
 acceptable release

76
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,900
for sexual tension             
 and frustration.

77
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,468
Riding one of those bulls      
 can do that, frase?

78
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:41,652
Oh, hell, no,

79
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,438
but if we catch a well-built   
 young woman sometime

80
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,407
bouncing around on the back    
 of one, though. Woo!

81
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,376
Get along, little doggy.

82
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,531
Hey, sam, which tie do you 
     think i should wear?

83
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,367
And, before you judge, 
         this one lights up.

84
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:57,735
You got batteries              
 for that one?

85
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:58,970
No.

86
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,121
Oh. Go with                    
 that one, then.                
                     Yeah.

87
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,323
Thanks, man.

88
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:05,259
You know, i--i can't afford 
    to make a mistake, here.

89
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,662
Kelly's mom     
                just flew in    
                this afternoon,

90
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,597
and kelly's     
                bringing her by 
                to meet me.

91
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,833
It's crucial       
             that i make        
             a good impression.

92
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,751
Wait a second,     
             i thought          
             you knew her mom.

93
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,636
No, no. They're divorced.

94
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,106
In fact, kelly's mom   
         is the only member     
         of her family

95
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,640
who i haven't met.

96
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,808
Yeah, god.

97
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,076
She's my last hope.

98
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,113
You're telling me

99
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,531
that not one member            
 of that family                 
 likes you?

100
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,801
Well, there's      
             her aunt martha,   
             she likes me.

101
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,219
Oh, there you go.

102
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,321
But she also thinks        
     she's eleanor roosevelt.

103
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,424
But if you get past that,      
 she's pretty nice,

104
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,826
what, with all                 
 her charity work.

105
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,714
Woody, it doesn't   
            make any difference

106
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,482
what kind of tie   
             you wear.

107
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,516
When it comes          
         to mothers,

108
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,701
it's what you got       
        underneath that counts.

109
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,588
Oh, well, i'm wearing          
 clean shorts, sam.

110
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:51,723
Oh, good.

111
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,158
He understands.

112
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,177
Woody, listen to me,           
 listen to me.

113
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,179
The important thing is         
 what kind of person you are,

114
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,481
and you are                    
 a very nice person.

115
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,934
Moms do not judge              
 how you look.

116
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:06,137
Oh, here           
             they are now.

117
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,155
(Sam)              
             uh-oh.

118
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:09,824
That mom looks like            
 she's got taste.

119
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,093
You're on your own, man.

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,978
I'll try to stall them.

121
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,864
You do...           
            well, never mind.

122
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,231
(Sam)          
                 hi, kelly,     
                 how are you?

123
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,466
Nice to see you 
                again.

124
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,733
It's nice                      
 to see you, too.

125
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,336
Sam malone,                    
 i'd like you                   
 to meet my mom.

126
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,589
Oh, and i'd love   
             to meet her        
             sometime myself.

127
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,006
Who's this,    
                 your sister?

128
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,809
Sam, this is my mom.

129
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:30,645
That was a tired,      
         old line, mr. Malone.

130
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,130
You're right.      
             I'm sorry.

131
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,681
No. It still works.

132
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:34,982
Well, you know, 
                the classics,

133
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,652
timeless.

134
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,854
Hi, kelly.         
             I'm sorry to       
             keep you waiting.

135
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,089
Nice to meet you.

136
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:43,657
Yeah, i--i was just 
            having trouble      
            tying this tie.

137
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,910
Is my face      
                getting purple?

138
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,879
No, woody. You--you look nice, 
 but are you ok?

139
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,082
You seem a little              
 uncomfortable.

140
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,751
Well, yeah. It's the   
         brand-new underwear.

141
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,675
I don't think i got    
         all the stickers off.

142
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:06,247
Woody, this is my mother       
 mrs. Gaines.

143
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,982
Mother, this is woody.

144
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,033
Hi. I'm woody.

145
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,335
Then i must be     
             mrs. Gaines.

146
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,704
Oh, hi. I'm woody.

147
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,622
Uh, listen, to tell you 
        the truth, mrs. Gaines,

148
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,440
i was real nervous 
             about meeting you.

149
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,209
Oh! Whatever for?

150
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,779
Well, you know, it's just  
     that the rest of kelly's   
     family hates me.

151
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:26,017
It's probably because      
     i'm a bartender            
     with no real future.

152
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,852
Just a poor             
        country bumpkin

153
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,787
who's dumber            
        than cotton.

154
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:33,141
Woody, i think         
         you're a very          
         nice young man.

155
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,794
Really? Well, then forget  
     all that bad stuff i said.

156
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,780
Now, woody, kelly tells me 
     you're resistant

157
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,283
to coming to her    
            sister's wedding    
            this weekend.

158
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,768
Mom, woody's                   
 self-conscious.

159
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,671
He always feels                
 that he sticks out             
 like a sore thumb

160
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,673
and makes a fool               
 out of himself.

161
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,624
Why is that, woody?

162
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,777
Well, there has been       
     a precedent set.

163
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,679
Although i think your gazebo   
 would've burned down

164
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,514
whether i'd been there     
     or not.

165
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:00,084
Well, woody, we'd all  
         like you to be there.

166
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,387
In fact, you're invited 
        to the rehearsal        
        dinner, as well.

167
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,622
Saturday night, 7:00,      
     kelly's father's house.

168
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,157
You've met mr. Gaines,     
     haven't you?

169
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,894
Met him? Heck, i almost    
     broke his big toe.

170
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,029
Woody, you didn't know         
 daddy was standing behind us

171
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,264
when you pulled                
 the van out.

172
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,766
Yeah, i did.

173
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,202
I just thought          
        he took a smaller shoe.

174
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:21,522
Well, we're looking    
         forward to seeing you.

175
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,708
Now come, kelly, dear.  
        We have to do something 
        about those nut cups,

176
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:26,911
and you know that could 
        take all afternoon.

177
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,414
Mother, i'm still              
 favoring jordan almonds.

178
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,582
Who raised you?

179
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,084
Oh, i almost forgot.

180
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,319
Sam.

181
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,552
Yeah?

182
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,372
You're invited                 
 to come saturday, too.

183
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,840
After all, you're almost       
 a member of the family.

184
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,526
Mother, sam was the one        
 who introduced woody and me.

185
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:45,095
Actually, no, i didn't.

186
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,981
You didn't?                
            No.

187
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,117
Well, gee, it would be rude    
 to uninvite you now,

188
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,336
so i--i guess we're stuck.

189
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,839
Well, we'll see you.

190
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,347
Come on, you cowboys!

191
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:05,983
As long as that dumb thing's   
 set up back there anyway,

192
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,819
don't you wanna prove          
 how macho you are              
 by climbing aboard?

193
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,521
Come on, rebecca!

194
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,323
We do not need     
             a mechanical bull

195
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,825
to prove               
         how macho we are. Ok?

196
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,260
We are just 
                    as much men

197
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,262
sitting right here 
             on this bar stool,

198
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,731
which, by the way,     
         needs to be repadded.  
         My tush hurts.

199
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,133
Really.

200
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:24,284
Face it, rebecca.

201
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:26,887
This dump is filled     
        with wussy wimps.

202
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:28,640
You just hold on there         
 right now, carla.

203
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:31,142
I, for one, have           
     a very good reason

204
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,344
for not, uh, riding        
     on that bull.

205
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,331
Right. He's afraid      
        his keys are gonna      
        fly out of his pocket.

206
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,968
Oh, yeah?                      
 You--you guys can go ahead     
 and make fun and all,

207
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,902
but, uh, you know,         
     you get on that thing,

208
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:44,172
the keys fly               
     out of your pocket,        
     it hits you in the eye,

209
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,674
you'll never enjoy         
     a view-master again,       
     i tell you.

210
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:50,511
Ah, baloney, clavin.    
        You're just a chicken.

            Keep your corns on.

214
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,339
I'm the only guy in this   
     waterin' hole, obviously,

215
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,209
who is man enough          
     to take on                 
     that mechanical beast.

216
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,878
Normie, watch my keys for me,  
 will ya? Safety first.

217
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,047
What are friends       
         for, cliff?

218
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,884
Well, i just got an idea

219
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,786
for a little practical     
     joke on cliffie.

220
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,054
What's that?

221
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,922
What do you say    
             we move his car.

222
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,491
He'll think    
                 it's stolen.

223
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,793
Ok, where do you want          
 to move it to?

224
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,995
Uh, new hampshire.

225
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:29,117
Yeah, come on,         
         follow me in your car  
         and drive me home.

226
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:31,569
Guys, hurry up.                
 Cliff has strapped             
 himself on the bull.

227
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,403
And it's bucking so hard,      
 he can't get off.

228
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,738
How the hell                
    did that happen?

[Cliff yelling]            
                come on, norm,  
                you know cliff.

230
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,543
He insisted        
             we start it on     
             the highest level.

231
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,911
Cliff insisted on that?

[Cliff shouting]

233
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,331

 Let's not split hairs.

00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,427
oh, woody,                     
 can you believe it?

238
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,830
You know, this is              
 the first time i've seen       
 my parents together

239
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:01,165
since they split up            
 when i was a little girl.

240
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,267
I bet that was         
         real tough on you.

241
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:06,404
Yeah. Sometimes i think        
 that's why i'm so cynical.

242
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,374
I like the fact that   
         you're hardboiled.

243
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,660
I think that's what     
        gives us our chemistry.

Thanks, sweetie.

245

Boy, i tell you, mr. Gaines.

246
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,452
I sure would like to live      
 in a place like this.

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,661
Well, mr. Malone,   
            you've gotten       
            tiresome.

250

I'm gonna stand    
             over there now.

Hey, sam, you know,         
    i was looking               
    in the dining room earlier.

252
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,542
And why the heck       
         do they have 2 forks   
         at everybody's place?

253
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,627
Oh, well, now, woody,          
 that's 'cause, uh,

254
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:49,630
well, if you drop one,      
    you--you got yourself       
    a spare.

255
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,982
Well,              
             that makes sense,

256
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,485
but now why is     
             one smaller        
             than the other?

257
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,437

 you drop that one, too,

258

it won't make               
    as much noise.

00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:25,659
Our stock deal     
             happened

409
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,511
just like          
             we knew it would.

410
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,913
All right!                 
     How about that!

411
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,131
That's great.

412
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,434
Sam, you didn't             
    invest any money

413
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,735
with conrad                
     and the guys,              
     did you?

414
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:37,237
I sure did. A bundle.

415
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,073
[Laughing]                 
     sam.

416
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,374
What?

417
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,909
Maybe you should think about   
 taking some food home.

418
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,178
Why?

419
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,513
Sam, we just found out

420
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,281
the company falsified          
 their profits.

421
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,950
The s.E.C.                     
 Suspended trading.             
 Stock's worthless.

422
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:50,951
What?

423
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,736
Sam, connie                
     and the guys

424
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,772
are known as                   
 "the hard luck 5."

425
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,890
Yeah, we invest in something,  
 down it goes.

426
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,508
Say, fellas,                   
 what say we fly to vegas

427
00:17:58,576 --> 00:17:59,959
and lose                    
    some serious money, huh?

428
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,978
We'll bet red all night.

429
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,383
You gonna finish that?

430
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,484
No.

431
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,825
Mrs. Gaines, thank you for     
 helping me adjust my napkin,

432
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,061
but it's really                
 not necessary.

433
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,196
By the way,

434
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,333
i don't usually wear it     
    tucked in quite so far.

435
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:25,836
Is there something about me

436
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,104
that makes you     
             nervous, woody?

437
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:31,691
Oh, i don't know.          
     The things you say,

438
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,727
y-your hands

439
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:35,929
your coconut-cracking      
     thighs.

440
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,983
Then you               
         have no problem

441
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,434
with my feet.

442
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:41,935
Mrs. Gaines, stop it!

443
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,270
I'm not                    
     having sex with you!

444
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,455
I won't have sex with you!

445
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:45,705
I won't! I won't! I won't!

446
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,508
No sex! Do you hear me?

447
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:48,909
Now i want                  
    both hands and both feet

448
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,877
on the table right now!

449
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:10,130
Kelly, am i using  
             the wrong fork     
             or something?

450
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,921
(Cliff)                    
     someone, get me off!

451
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,406
$5. $5!

452
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:22,159
You know, carla,               
 if cliff actually              
 broke the world record,

453
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,094
it would be                
     good publicity             
     for the bar.

454
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,863
Yeah, but i can't find     
     any record in here at all

455
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,365
for mechanical bull    
         riding.

456
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,634
Look under                  
    "stupidest stunts."

457
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,539
Here it is. First page.

458
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,009
I've lost kelly forever.

459
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:42,145
She's never gonna              
 want to talk to me again       
 after what i've done.

460
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,913
Come on, woody.

461
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:45,315
Look, i'm sure lots of guys

462
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:47,083
yell out           
             at dinner parties

463
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:50,137
that they won't        
         have sex with their    
         girlfriends' mothers.

464
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:52,439
Yeah, you're               
     probably right,            
     mr. Peterson,

465
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:55,259
but that still              
    doesn't help                
    ease the pain.

466
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,546
Hi, woody.

467
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:00,380
Kelly.

468
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:02,682
Are you ok?

469
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,018
Well, i thought you'd      
     never want to see me again

470
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:06,653
after what i did.

471
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,206
Well, i admit, i was        
    a bit peeved at first,

472
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,376
but i can understand.

473
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,911
You know, i--i'm just sorry    
 that mother gave you           
 the wrong impression.

474
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,563
What do you mean?

475
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,398
Woody, maybe i should have     
 warned you about her.

476
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,000
Mother likes to flirt.

477
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,902
But it's all innocent fun.

478
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,771
She says                    
    it keeps her young.

479
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,924
You mean she was just   
        goofing around with me?

480
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,826
She's flirted with             
 all my boyfriends.

481
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:32,079
Of course, nobody's been       
 rude about it like you.

482
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,047
All right, wood.       
         Way to go.

483
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,018
So i've blown it.

484
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:41,522
Now i've blown it          
     with every single member   
     of your family.

485
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,192
You haven't blown it           
 with one very important        
 person, woody.

486
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:46,543
I know.

487
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:49,379
Your crazy aunt martha.

488
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:52,849
Of course, she thinks  
         i'm winston churchill.

489
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,885
No, woody, with me.            
 Don't you see?

490
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,705
It--it doesn't matter          
 what my family thinks.

491
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,708
I love you.

492
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:04,344
Besides,                    
    mother still likes you.

493
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:08,382
As a matter of fact,           
 she wanted to come here        
 and apologize in person.

494
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,884
But i thought it might         
 make you nervous,

495
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:13,320
so i had her write you         
 a note instead.

496
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,889
Oh, that was       
             real nice of her.

497
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,624
Woody, i've got to run.

498
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,627
I'm just supposed to be        
 out for a few minutes          
 picking up cold cuts.

499
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,229
It seems like           
        a lot of food           
        disappeared.

500
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,399
We don't know              
     what happened.

501
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,634
Good night, sam.

502
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,505
[Muffled]               
        good night, kelly.

503
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,464
So, smooth sailing,        
     huh, wood?

504
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:41,798
Yeah, i am so relieved.

505
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:42,899
(Norm)     
                     all right.

506
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,567
Well, i mean,       
            i should have known

507
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,603
that, uh, mrs. Gaines  
         wouldn't be            
         interested in me.

508
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:47,671
[All chuckling]

509
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,939
i should have known

510
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,157
that a nice classy 
             lady like her

511
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:52,659
would never     
                be interested

512
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,195
in a naive         
             indiana farm boy.

513
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:57,263
Well, i have to admit          
 it is kind of silly, isn't it?

514
00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:59,599
Woody and mrs. Gaines,

515
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,102
it's about the most        
     ridiculous thing           
     i ever heard.

516
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,237
[All laughing]

517
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:04,955
hey, man, you think 
            that's funny,

518
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,857
wait till you hear this.

519
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,058
"Dear, woody,

520
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,127
"kelly thinks i'm

526
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,544
Is she a crack-up,     
         or what?

527

[All laughing]

528
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,233
ma'am,             
             a textbook rescue.

529
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,801
We have the walls  
             covered with       
             mattresses.

530
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,336
All we have to do  
             is cut the power,

531
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:39,006
and he'll land there   
         safe as a baby.

532
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:41,007
All right, let's not           
 waste any more time.           
 Let's do it.

533
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,610
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  
 According to this book here,

534
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:46,379
if clavin can stay 
             on that bull for   
             5 more hours,

535
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,165
he's gonna break   
             the world record.

536
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,501
Hey, clavin, do you     
        want to get off,

537
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,670
or do you want to          
     be world champion?

538
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:55,672
[Cliff yelling]            
     i want, i want,            
     i want to get off!

For the l-love of god,     
     get me o-off!
