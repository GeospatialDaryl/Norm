1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,085
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,355
(phone ringing)

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,858
(answering machine clicks)

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,827
WOODY (over machine):
Hi, this is Cheers.

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:15,463
Well, it isn't actually Cheers,
it's Woody Boyd.

6
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:16,697
Cheers is actually the bar,

7
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:18,733
and as such,
it couldn't be expected to talk.

8
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,201
SAM:
Woody, start again.

9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,802
WOODY:
Why? I'm doing fine.

10
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:24,872
Anyway, uh, there's no one here
to take your call right now.

11
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:26,341
Well, actually,
if you called right now,

12
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:28,476
we could take your call,
but if you call when you're...

13
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:29,977
SAM:
Woody, would you cut it out?

14
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:30,978
It's sounding stupid.

15
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:31,979
WOODY:
I am not.

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,148
W-W-Why do you always treat me

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,215
like I don't know
what I'm doing?

18
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,316
SAM:
It sounds stupid, Woody.

19
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:36,884
WOODY:
It does not.

20
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:38,753
(machine beeps)

21
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:40,155
Hi, Sam, this is Woody.

22
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,789
Uh, I guess you were right.

23
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,425
It does sound stupid.

24
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,926
I'll change it tomorrow.

25
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,962

Hey, everybody.

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,353
How's it going?

43
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:03,522
Hey, Norm, look at this.

44
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,557
I just got myself
a brand-new video camera.

45
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,691
Ooh, nice one.

46
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:07,726
Looks kind of expensive.

47
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,927
Oh, yeah, it is, it is,

48
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,495
but it-it'll pay for
itself in no time at all.

49
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,230
Yeah?
Yeah.

50
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,933
Yeah, I plan to stage
some footage for those programs,

51
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,835
you know, like
America's Funniest Home Videos,

52
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,988
Rescue 911, Nightline,
stuff like that.

53
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:24,942
Cliff, I don't think
Nightline is staged.

54
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,944
You are so naive.

55
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,746
(door opens)

56
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:31,482
Good afternoon, everybody.

57
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,151
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

58
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,986
So, what's new?

59
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,138
Got a message
for you here, Fras.

60
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,173
Yeah, here we go.

61
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,441
Shauna called you.

62
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,575
(patrons hoot)

63
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,311
Now, settle down, class.

64
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,347
Shauna is my secretary.

65
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,148
(all hooting)

66
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,433
My temporary secretary.

67
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,318
She's all of 21 years old,
for God's sake.

68
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,486
(all hooting)

69
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,755
Come on, stop it, you guys.

70
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,473
Have a little class, will you?

71
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,391
So you going to
try and bag her?

72
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,314
No, I am not.

73
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,651
Although it's not entirely
out of the realm of reality.

74
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:10,788
It does seem that the lass
has a... a thing, for Dr. Crane.

75
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:11,956
(laughs)

76
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,608
(chuckles) Good for you.

77
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,394
Well, I mean, after all,
it's not so hard to believe.

78
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,812
I've been keeping myself
in pretty good shape.

79
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,403
You know, I've been
Nordic Tracking it every night.

80
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,934
Don't you worry, Peter.

81
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,469
Your parents' 50th
anniversary party will go off

82
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,570
without a hitch.

83
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,905
We'll provide
everything you need...

84
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,990
the food, the drinks, the
decorations, the works.

85
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,325
Sign here.

86
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,493
I can't thank you enough
for all your help.

87
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:34,162
Good, then we'll see
you on Sunday afternoon.

88
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,297
You'll find every
detail will be perfect.

89
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,484
Terrific, now all I
need is a photographer.

90
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,785
Hey, whoa, whoa, hey.

91
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,919
Whoa, whoa.

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,053
Excuse me, there, buddy boy.

93
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,589
I, uh, couldn't
help overhearing

94
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,057
that you're looking
for a photographer?

95
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,259
That's right.
Well, you are in luck.

96
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,210
I'm Clifford Clavin,

97
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:52,013
one of the best camcorder
jockeys in all of Boston.

98
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,714
If you're
in the video business,

99
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,616
why are you dressed
as a mail-man?

100
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,989
Costume party down at
the Directors Guild.

101
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,341
Yeah.

102
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,442
So, what do you say?

103
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,078
You want me to do your
party for, for 50 clams?

104
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,062
Sounds terrific.

105
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:09,597
I guess I'm pretty lucky
to have run into you.

106
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:10,598
Yeah.
I'll see you on Sunday.

107
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,767
Hey, you betcha.

108
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,468
Huh, huh, huh?

109
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,303
What do you think, Norm, huh?

110
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,206
It's the beginning of a
whole new career there.

111
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,207
Yeah.

112
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,743
Speaking of which, uh,

113
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:23,812
I could use an assistant
for my video endeavours.

114
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,846
Uh, what do you say?

115
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:29,283
I could start you off
at 20, uh, 15 bucks.

116
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:30,819
15 bucks?

117
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,420
I could use the money.

118
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:36,791
I've got to get Vera
a Christmas present.

119
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:41,763
Uh, Christmas was
a couple of weeks ago.

120
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,531
Oh, my.

121
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,615
(door opens)

122
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,369
Hi, Dr. Crane.

123
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,555
Oh, hello, Shauna.

124
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,323
(patrons hoot softly)

125
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,594
You, uh, left some papers
on your desk,

126
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:57,762
and they looked important,

127
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,198
so I thought
I'd bring them over.

128
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,466
Well, you didn't really...

129
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,735
I mean, these weren't
that important.

130
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,038
There's no need, uh,
these could have waited.

131
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:06,988
Oh, I-I don't mind.

132
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,123
I-I wasn't doing
anything anyway,

133
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:10,591
and besides,
it gives me a chance

134
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,594
to see you
outside of the office.

135
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:16,564
I think you look
even better in here.

136
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:19,667
Yes, uh, dank
basements flatter me.

137
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,702
(laughing)

138
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,406
(laughing)

139
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:27,942
Oh, Dr. Crane.

140
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:29,910
Can I ask you a question?

141
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,529
Well, yes, go right ahead.

142
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,566
Well, this is probably
against the rules,

143
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,252
but would you be
at all interested in,

144
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:39,354
you know,

145
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:42,790
seeing each other
outside the office sometime?

146
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:44,959
(hooting softly)

147
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,845
Uh, well, uh,

148
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,263
oh, uh,

149
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,584
gosh, Shauna, I, uh, you
know, I'm-I'm terribly busy,

150
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,985
and of course there
is my son to think of.

151
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,020
Oh, hey, listen,

152
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,056
I-I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

153
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,175
Um, tell you what.

154
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:02,010
Let me just go check and see
if you have any messages,

155
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,211
and then I'll be on my way.

156
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,222
Are you crazy?

157
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,391
Did I just hear you turn
down a date with that girl?

158
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:18,692
Come on, man, reel her in.

159
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,461
Oh, Sam, you don't seem
to understand.

160
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:23,331
Look, I just came
off a seven-year marriage.

161
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:26,901
It's hard to...
think of replacing Lilith.

162
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:30,571
Just go to the morgue
and open any drawer.

163
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,526
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

164
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,563
I'm not, I'm not saying you
got to replace the corp...

165
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,498
replace Lilith.

166
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,734
All I'm saying is, you know,
ask-ask her out on a date.

167
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,938
Well, perhaps...
i-in a few days maybe.

168
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:48,973
No, come on, do it now.

169
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,341
Ask her right this sec...

170
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,211
I tell you, if you don't,
I'm gonna ask her out.

171
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,214
You got one minute on
the old Sammy clock.

172
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,033
All right, by George,
I'll do it right this minute.

173
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,101
Attaboy.

174
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:02,036
Frasier Crane
is back in the game.

175
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,671
(laughs)

176
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,239
No messages.

177
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:08,142
Uh, Shauna, uh,

178
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:11,478
what you were saying
before, uh,

179
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,799
about our seeing
each other, um...

180
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,151
Well, uh, to put it this way,

181
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,722
uh, about, you know,
you and me, uh...

182
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:23,657
You got about 30 seconds.

183
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,031
Would you really like
to go out with me?

184
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:30,965
(chuckles)

185
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,499
You bet I would.

186
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,601
You know, uh, I have an idea.

187
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,304
Instead of going out,

188
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,273
why don't you come
over to my place

189
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,074
for dinner on Sunday night?

190
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,459
Uh, your place?

191
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,328
Uh, well, I'd be delighted.

192
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,865
Uh, can I bring anything-
a dessert maybe?

193
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,816
Oh, no, Dr. Crane.

194
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,385
Don't bring dessert.

195
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,453
I'll take care of that.

196
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,659
You're going to get dessert!
You're going to get dessert!

197
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,651
I told you we're closed.

198
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,336
It's a private party.

199
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,072
Employees only.

200
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,073
Please.

201
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,540
I'll tell them I own the place.

202
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,842
I do it all the time.

203
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,110
For the last time, go home!

204
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:17,211
Ow!

205
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:22,750
Carla, will you stop being
rude to the customers?

206
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,552
It was Paul.

207
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,021
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't
see through the glass.

208
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:28,089
(door opens)

209
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,474
Okay, here we are, Frederick.

210
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:31,960
(chuckling):
Hey.

211
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,061
It's my pal Freddy.

212
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:34,329
Go to your Uncle Sammy there.

213
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,331
Here we go.
Oh, Sam.

214
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,499
Listen, I can't thank you
enough for volunteering

215
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,802
to fill in
when the babysitter cancelled.

216
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,937
I mean, if you hadn't offered,

217
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,605
I wouldn't be able
to see Sauna tonight.

218
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:47,541
I mean, I mean...
Shauna.

219
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,576
Wow, boy,
there's a slip for you!

220
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:50,611
(Frasier and Sam laugh)

221
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:51,712
Aw, it's my pleasure.

222
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,598
You're looking good, Freddy.

223
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,499
Okay, now, I brought
some of his toys here.

224
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,234
We've got his,
uh, his choo-choo.

225
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,268
Hmm.

226
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:01,038
And his blankey.
Mm-hmm.

227
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:02,440
And his toy soldier.

228
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,507
Here you go.
Ooh, cool.

229
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:06,343
And, uh-
well, let's see...

230
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:09,581
bag full of educational crap
that Lilith got him.

231
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,799
Ah.

232
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,136
And his, uh, favourite book
The Runaway Bunny.

233
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,488
You keep that
book away from me.

234
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,090
How come, Carla?

235
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:20,324
I have eight kids.

236
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:22,292
I've read that book
a thousand times,

237
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:25,329
and every time I read it,
I bawl like a baby.

238
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,248
Oh, no kidding.

239
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:29,634
"Once there was a little bunny

240
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,603
Stop it. No, stop it.
"who wanted to run away..."

241
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,071
(continues reading) Stop it!

242
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,706
Stop it! Stop it!

243
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,874
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

244
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,492
Frasier, can I take
Freddy a minute?

245
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:39,543
Well, of course.

246
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:40,795
You remember Auntie Rebecca?

247
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,429
Hello.
Good boy, Frederick.

248
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,198
Yeah, take them both,
take them both.

249
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,232
There you go.
Thank you.

250
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,366
All right, Sam, now listen,

251
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,769
here's a list of numbers.

252
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:50,204
Here's, uh, my beeper.

253
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:51,906
This is, uh, Shauna's house.

254
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,859
And this is Lilith
at the eco-pod.

255
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,045
They got a telephone
at the eco-pod?

256
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,747
Well, no, it's just
for emergencies,

257
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:02,283
but, uh, listen, call her,
yank her chain for me.

258
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:04,685
I won't have a chance
to do it tonight. (laughs)

259
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,855
I'll see if I can get to it.
Thanks. Oh, and, uh,

260
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,472
one other thing I need
to discuss with you.

261
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,708
Very important,
uh, in, uh, private.

262
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,977
Could you just join
me in the men's room?

263
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,712
In the men's room?

264
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,148
That's a little weird, isn't it?

265
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,648
Oh, Sam, get your head

266
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,484
out of the seventh grade
for God's sake!

267
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,853
We're just two men having
a private conversation.

268
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,904
All right, okay.

269
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,188
Well, don't go in with me!

270
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,456
How would that look?!

271
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,310
CLIFF:
Oh!

272
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,212
All right, hey, there you are.

273
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,180
Okay, everybody, just relax.

274
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,165
Don't mind me.

275
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,566
Pretend like I'm not here.

276
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,802
There you are.
Everything's all set.

277
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,937
I took the liberty of making
name tags for everybody.

278
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,239
See? Hello, my
name's Rebecca.

279
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,309
And this one is for you, Peter.

280
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,277
And your name is?

281
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,563
We're all family.

282
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,364
We know each other's names.

283
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,567
Well, let me make one
out for you anyway.

284
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,035
B-I-T-C...

285
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,656
Come on, man.
I got a party out here!

286
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,791
FRASIER:
All right, Sam, please.

287
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,093
This is very important.

288
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,062
(door unlocks)

289
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:08,766
(hums)

290
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:19,277
What do you think?

291
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,496
Oh, it's super.

292
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,364
Really?

293
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,331
Oh, you're ser...?

294
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:26,433
Oh, I'm...
no, I'm sorry.

295
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,903
No, uh... oh, I can't
lie to you, man.

296
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,204
This is just, uh...

297
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,807
Well, it's-it's not you.

298
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,708
(laughs) Damn, you know...

299
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:37,178
It looked so good
on the Styrofoam head.

300
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:42,016
Oh, hell, Sam,
who am I trying to kid?

301
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,385
Oh, this is ridiculous.

302
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,487
I'm gonna call
Shauna and cancel.

303
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:47,888
Oh, well, wait a second.

304
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,023
Wh-What are you doing, man?
She likes you.

305
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:51,459
Didn't you hear what she said?

306
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,861
"Oh, no, Dr. Crane,
don't bring dessert.

307
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:55,596
I'll take care of that."

308
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,131
(both laugh)

309
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,385
Oh, I'm just... I'm just
too old to be dating.

310
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,437
Oh, stop it! Come on,
you were a ladies man

311
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:05,505
before you met Lilith,
weren't you? Well, yeah.

312
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:06,640
Yeah, you were!

313
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,608
Hey, look at that.
Look at that.

314
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:09,376
You are
a good-lookin' man.

315
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,196
Well, I'm not exactly a...
a dog.

316
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,114
(chuckling)

317
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,616
Come on. Go over there,
enjoy yourself.

318
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,281
You know, all you've
got to do is

319
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,321
bring a little champagne,
some flowers,

320
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,655
sweet talk her a little bit.

321
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,858
Before you know it,
it's time to go home.

322
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,060
Or maybe, you don't go home.

323
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,062
You know what I mean?
(both laughing)

324
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,663
Is that the way, uh,
most dates go for you, Sam?

325
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:30,998
No, now come on,
now, don't do that.

326
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,299
See, this is not a test.

327
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,504
You're not expected
to perform at my level.

328
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,272
The thing is just to...

329
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:40,941
enjoy myself, as myself.

330
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,076
Yes.

331
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,746
Okay. Thanks, Sam.
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,148
Now, Frasier Crane...

333
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:50,484
is gonna go get some
before it gets cold.

334
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,653
(laughs)

335
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:56,790
Oh...
Everything okay in here, Sam?

336
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,125
Yeah, yeah,
no problem just, uh,

337
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:59,860
you know, I had to help
Frasier out with something.

338
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,195
(clicks tongue)

339
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,698
We've got bigger problems, Sam.

340
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,283
Those things are back!

341
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,410
(doorbell chimes)

342
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,727
Well, come on in,
Dr. Crane.

343
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:34,929
Dinner's on the table.

344
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:37,197
How old are you, like, 90?

345
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,460
Okay, so this button's
the "on-off" button.

346
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,930
This, uh, this button here
makes it louder or softer.

347
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,215
And these two
buttons right here

348
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:58,084
make everything
bluer or greener.

349
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,553
Those two are my favourites.

350
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:01,755
Have a ball there.

351
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,023
Poor kid.

352
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,759
Probably don't let him
watch enough TV at home.

353
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,361
Yeah.

354
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,331
It's a wonder why some
people even have kids. Oh...

355
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,951
Great shot.
Great shot.

356
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:16,653
Oh! Hey, listen, ma'am,

357
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:18,255
would you mind holding
this in your lap

358
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:20,590
and just tilt it up
at an angle like that?

359
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,060
I want to do
a slow tracking shot.

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,100
Hi, sexy.

361
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,202
What are you going to be
doing after work tonight?

362
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,805
Trying to forget you
asked me that.

363
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,009
Well, you do great work.

364
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,344
Look for your, uh,

365
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:43,447
credits in the end titles,
there, sweetheart.

366
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:48,285
Cliffie, what's this red
blinking light mean?

367
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:49,954
Oh, that means
the battery's dead.

368
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,288
All right, give me the spare.

369
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,023
I'll slap it in for you.

370
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,648
Actually, I don't, I don't
have a spare there, Norm.

371
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:57,928
Okay, uh, no problem,
just give me the power cord.

372
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,463
We'll find an outlet.

373
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,007
These come with power cords?

374
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,702
What are you...?
What are you telling me?

375
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:08,071
That this camera doesn't...
this camera is useless?

376
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,906
These people paid us
good money, Cliff.

377
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,107
What are we going to do?!

378
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,643
Relax, will you, Norm.

379
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,611
We'll-We'll figure
out some kind of a plan.

380
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,681
Well, you'd better
come up with something.

381
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,349
All right, here.
Here's what we'll do. All right.

382
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,618
We'll just carry on and film
as though nothing's wrong.

383
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,120
We'll pretend
the camera's working.

384
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,739
Then in a couple of days
when they call us for the film,

385
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,610
we'll say,
"We dropped it in the mail.

386
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,885
It must have gotten lost."

387
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,429
All right?
We got the 50 bucks,

388
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,798
nobody's the wiser.

389
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,099
Great, great, as long
as you have a plan.

390
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,168
Norm, you know,
in a couple of weeks,

391
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,536
nobody here's gonna remember

392
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,872
some stupid
anniversary party. Yeah.

393
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,273
(clinking)

394
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,092
Attention, everyone!

395
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,662
I've waited
50 years to say this.

396
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:49,729
Wait a minute, Dad.

397
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,965
Say it into the camera.

398
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:53,400
We want to preserve
this moment forever.

399
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,736
Hey, guys, come on over!

400
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,742
Okay, coming right up!
Come on, Norm.

401
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:05,479
Let's go capture this
moment on video tape.

402
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,115
I-I don't know
why it's taken me so long

403
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,683
to say this to you kids,

404
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:12,619
but I love you,

405
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:15,389
every one of you.

406
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,263
Cliff, you've got to tell them.

407
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:25,182
It's not my fault
the guy took 50 years

408
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,268
to tell his kids he loved them.

409
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:31,571
I mean, what kind
of father is that anyway?

410
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,907
All right, so there was
one moment in the whole thing.

411
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,142
Big whoops.

412
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:36,910
I mean, you know, with all
the drinking and yelling,

413
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:38,479
nobody's gonna
remember anything.

414
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,648
Grandma! Grandpa!

415
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,118
I flew 34 hours

416
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:45,952
in a marine cargo
plane to get here.

417
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:48,071
But it's worth it all
just to say,

418
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,140
"Happy Anniversary,
I love you!"

419
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,875
(gasping, applause)

420
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:57,615
Oh, Terry, my baby boy!

421
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,016
Thank God we're getting
this on tape!

422
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,102
(sotto voce):
Yeah, thank God.

423
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,754
My God, Terry.
They wouldn't tell us

424
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,689
if you were alive or dead.

425
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,058
There's one thing
that kept me alive.

426
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,260
I was thinking about
coming home to you.

427
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,829
Oh!
Oh!

428
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,181
All right, Cliff, come on.

429
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:15,448
What are we gonna do here?

430
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,683
You got to tell them.

431
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:17,851
All right,
look, look everybody.

432
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,387
My boss here has
an announcement to make.

433
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:23,857
Uh, yeah, everybody.

434
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:25,959
I've got to go on my break.

435
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,928
My assistant will take over.

436
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:31,798
All right, now, let's, uh,

437
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,567
squeeze in tight everybody.

438
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,613
So...

439
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,049
you're, uh, Shauna's family.

440
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,817
You know, when Shauna
invited me for dinner,

441
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:52,552
she didn't mention
that we'd be having dinner

442
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:55,222
with her whole family.

443
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,823
(Frasier chuckles)

444
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:01,362
Interestingly enough,
many young people today

445
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,430
are choosing to move
back in with their parents.

446
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:06,666
We call it the, uh,
"Full Nest Syndrome."

447
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,251
It wasn't her choice.

448
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,754
Well...

449
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,857
Shauna's made
some bad decisions.

450
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,977
She's not real good
on responsibility.

451
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,397
Well, I must say that she, uh,

452
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,633
she handled herself quite
well this week at my office.

453
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:26,136
Thank you,
Dr. Crane. See?!

454
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:29,423
Oh, yeah, Doctor,

455
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,891
I forgot I was getting
a professional opinion.

456
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,410
Where did you go to school?

457
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,544
Harvard.

458
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:37,264
Well, la-di-da.

459
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,602
And is this what they taught
you at Harvard?

460
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:43,103
How to take advantage
of my daughter?

461
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:46,557
Sir, I am not taking advantage.

462
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,275
I was merely invited for an
innocent little dinner.

463
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,311
Oh? Just "an innocent
little dinner"?

464
00:18:51,312 --> 00:18:52,613
Mind if I check your wallet?

465
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,547
There's no need for that!

466
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,087
I don't like this, Shauna.

467
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,622
But why not, Daddy?

468
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,223
Isn't this the kind
of guy that you always

469
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,457
wanted me to date?

470
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,926
Is this the choice you give me?

471
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,696
Either some silver-spoon egghead
or that hippy?

472
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,213
Why are you bringing up Rick?

473
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,883
I thought I was
forbidden to see Rick.

474
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:16,670
"Rick"?

475
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,305
That's her old boyfriend.

476
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,606
Okay, I get it.

477
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,009
All right, thank you,
Shauna, for inviting me to be

478
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,276
a little pawn in your game.

479
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,945
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'll just be going.

480
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,847
Oh, no,
please stay, Dr. Crane.

481
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,281
Everything is fine.

482
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:31,218
Everything is just fine.

483
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:33,119
Uh, Tater Tots?

484
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,523
I don't know
why he likes Shauna.

485
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:38,792
She's only big up there,
'cause she stuffs.

486
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,677
Shut up, Todd!

487
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,517
He would have found out,

488
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,265
in, like, a year.

489
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,651
Make him shut up!

490
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:50,420
(motorcycle approaching)

491
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:51,955
And whom else have we invited

492
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,857
for dinner, tonight, Shauna?

493
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,475
If I'm right
and this is in fact

494
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,646
the worst night of my life,
it would be Rick.

495
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,562
Well, you know that drop-out's

496
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:00,964
not allowed in this house.

497
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,716
Shauna!

498
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,200
Rick!

499
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,169
You came for me.

500
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:07,904
You really do love me.

501
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,990
Oh, please.

502
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,742
That's it,
I'm calling the police.

503
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,694
Daddy, why can't you like Rick?

504
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:15,662
Can't you see that
we're in love?

505
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,463
Don't you run out
on me, Shauna!

506
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:18,631
I'm your father!

507
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:19,850
(door slams)
Don't lock that door.

508
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,551
Don't lock that door.
Don't lock that door.

509
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:22,920
(pounding on door)

510
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,388
I think I'll just be going now.

511
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,959
Why? Everything
is just fine.

512
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,761
It's just fine.

513
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,481
Now, who's got room for dessert?

514
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,493
So I guess, Freddy, uh,

515
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,161
you know what they're
saying is that wherever

516
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:51,998
the baby bunny goes,
the mommy bunny is...

517
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:55,068
is there waiting for
him to take care of him.

518
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,534
I guess I, uh,
must have touched my eye

519
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,840
with some of that, uh,
salt from the peanuts.

520
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,312
(crying):
Me, too.

521
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:06,480
That's it, yeah.

522
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,581
Let's do the good-byes now.

523
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,149
Wave, yes.

524
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:11,117
See you later.
Had a good time.

525
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:13,142
We're gonna need
a lot of copies of this.

526
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,054
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, you'll get 'em.

527
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,139
All right, sir.

528
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,191
You'll get those copies,
all right.

529
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,294
We're going to jail, Norm.

530
00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:21,428
What do you mean "we"?

531
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:22,663
I'm only the assistant here.

532
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,715
(groans)

533
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:28,185
Everybody,
I have something to say.

534
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,470
I want you all to know that

535
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:35,074
you have given me the strength
to do this.

536
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:39,079
(gasping, murmuring)

537
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,492
This is too much, Cliff.

538
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,661
Either you tell them
now, or I'm going to.

539
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,964
Yeah, well, I guess I'd better

540
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:58,832
before Bigfoot walks in here

541
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,735
and starts singing
"The Anniversary Waltz."

542
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,055
I guess if you give me the tape,
we'll be going.

543
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,008
Oh! So you want
the tape right now?

544
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,677
Uh, I tell you what,
how about if I take

545
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:12,379
a shot from up here,
one last shot.

546
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,381
Norm, uh...
Everybody, over here!

547
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,316
Turn this way, uh...

548
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:18,318
let me see those
pearly whites, huh?

549
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:19,719
Okay, everybody smile.

550
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,388
Okay, we'll just
back it up here, Norm.

551
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:22,523
Back it up.

552
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:24,458
(clears throat):
Open the door, Norm.

553
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,193
Okay, back it up.
That's good.

554
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,628
Okay, I'm just
gonna back it up.

555
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,780
Everybody wave, yeah.

556
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,147
Run like hell!

557
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,029
Yahtzee!
(laughing)
