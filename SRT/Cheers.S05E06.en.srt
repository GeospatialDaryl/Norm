1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,971
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:08,224
Boy, did I have a
crazy dream last night.

3
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:09,175
What was it?

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,644
I was at this party with
a bunch of strangers.

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,147
The food was great. The music was loud.

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,648
All of a sudden,

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,650
everybody in the place
stopped and was lookin' at me,

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,652
and I realized that I
wasn't wearing any pants.

9
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:20,653
Oh, yes, yes.

10
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,156
I've had that dream a million times.

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,859
Yeah, me, too, and boy, is
it ever embarrassing, huh?

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,277
Why is that?

13
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:33,783
Uh... uh, Norm?

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,285
Never embarrassed me.

15
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,202
Tell you the one I hate.

16
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,204
You know, you're back in college, right?

17
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,206
And you haven't been to
class the entire semester,

18
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,208
and the teacher's about
to give the final exam.

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,710
Oh, yeah, that one's the worst.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,211
What're you talkin' about, Carla?

21
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,379
You never went to college.

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,631
It's a dream, stupid.

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,354
Well, how about the one where
you go to this fancy restaurant,

24
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,355
and before they let you in,

25
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,856
they make you leave
your legs at the door?

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,362
Then the girl gives you
claim check number six.

27
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,730
So you go in,

28
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,065
but instead of food,

29
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
everyone's eatin' their silverware.

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
Only you can't really enjoy your fork

31
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
because you're so worried

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,572
that whoever got claim check
number nine might finish first

33
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,958
and pick up your legs by mistake.

34
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,130
Yeah, oh, yeah.

35
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:26,086

00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,108
Wallbanger!

52
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:42,111
Sam, I need to ask a big favor.

53
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,114
All right, as long as
it doesn't interfere

54
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,616
with your job.

55
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:50,370
Okay, then, I need to ask a huge favor.

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,704
Would it be possible

57
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,206
two weeks from this coming Wednesday

58
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,210
for me to leave work
early about ten minutes?

59
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,212
Sure, why not?

60
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,214
Oh, thank you, Sam.

61
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,583
Thank you very much.

62
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,885
And thank you for not prying further

63
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,887
into the matter.

64
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:12,392
Especially since, well,
I've no valid excuse

65
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,894
for my early departure.

66
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,764
Sam, I must be frank.

67
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,149
Sounds good.

68
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:21,651
I'll be Bob.

69
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,155
I mean, it's not as if I had

70
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:27,156
a dental appointment

71
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:30,159
or had to pick up some
relative at the airport.

72
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,160
Okay, Diane,

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,162
why do you have to leave early

74
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,031
two weeks from this Wednesday?

75
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,783
Well, if you must know...

76
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,036
I have a date.

77
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:42,255
Oh, yeah, I've heard of those.

78
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,590
Have fun.

79
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:50,096
Oh, sweet transparent bravado.

80
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,048
Could there be a soul dearer

81
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,050
than the little boy lost,

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,552
trembling on the edge of despair,

83
00:03:56,552 --> 00:04:00,890
yet struggling manfully to
maintain his stiff upper lip?

84
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,527
Thank you for noticing.

85
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,029
Oh, wait, Sam, wait. One more thing.

86
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,030
What?

87
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,033
After our five-star-dinner-
and-season-premiere-

88
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,034
of-the-ballet
date,

89
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:16,539
Chad-- Dr. Stark,
may desire a kiss.

90
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,042
Would you mind--
should he ask--

91
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:22,045
if I let his lips touch mine?

92
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,547
Touch your what?

93
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,550
Oh, Mr. Peterson, I forgot.

94
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,052
Some guy dropped by earlier

95
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,054
and asked me to give this to you.

96
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:32,055
Oh, thank you, Woody.

97
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,507
And thank you, God!

98
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,509
Oh, well, what's that, Normie?

99
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,262
A research grant from the
National Beer Foundation?

100
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:42,065
No, Cliffie, just a measly
little pair of sky-view seats

101
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:44,567
for the Sox-Yankee
doubleheader tomorrow.

102
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:45,568
Whoa, you're kidding me!

103
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,570
I pulled every string I had

104
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,572
and I could only score standing room.

105
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,573
Come on. How'd you get that?

106
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:51,574
Sammy, it's not who you know,

107
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,076
it's who I know, all right?

108
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,077
Yeah.

109
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,579
A client friend of mine, Jerry Donahue,

110
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,081
sent those babies over to thank me

111
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,450
for being such a fantastic
financial counselor.

112
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,951
No, seriously, how'd you get 'em?

113
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,870
I'm tellin' you,

114
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,122
I saved the guy a bundle
on his taxes last year.

115
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,341
He asked me to invest
his windfall, you know?

116
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,093
And in the space of six short months,

117
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,095
I kinda doubled his money.

118
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,597
We got lucky on a little
convenience mart in Worcester.

119
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,599
What'd you do? Hold it up?

120
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:17,600
(laughs)

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,601
You guys are hilarious.

122
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,602
But Jerry's laughing

123
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:21,104
all the way to the bank, all right?

124
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:22,472
I diversified the guy.

125
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,307
We went into, uh, mutuals,

126
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,309
and a very pretty little biotech company

127
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:27,310
that just went public.

128
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,313
Boy, sounds like you got
the Midas touch there.

129
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,314
You should hear some
of the other great ideas

130
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,315
we have cooked up.

131
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,733
Yeah? Like what?

132
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,737
Mm... no, no, sorry, guys.

133
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,238
My lips are sealed.

134
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,740
Buy you a beer.

135
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,741
It's called "Tan 'N Wash".

136
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,744
Tan and wash, guys.

137
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,746
The ultimate marriage of
luxury and convenience.

138
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,749
A combination tanning salon
and coin-operated laundry.

139
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,668
Get real.

140
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:53,669
Come on.

141
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,172
The timing's right on this.

142
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,173
Summer tans are fading.

143
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,174
Winter's coming.

144
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,675
It's always dirty clothes season.

145
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:01,677
It's gonna be the hottest place in town.

146
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,563
I'm glad you're already
thinking about arson.

147
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,981
(laughs): Yeah, arson.

148
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,849
Don't listen to them, Norman.

149
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,852
And never be deterred
by the mindless jibes

150
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,020
of the ignorant masses.

151
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,905
Those ignorant masses are
gonna be our customers.

152
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:17,276
Hey, I'll be there will bells on.

153
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,612
Everyone'll be there, buddy,

154
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,114
fluffing, folding, relaxing happily

155
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,116
beneath the healthful rays

156
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,619
of a federally approved
UVA bronzing unit.

157
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,121
Well, Normie,

158
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,123
I gotta say it's the silliest,
most harebrained scheme

159
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,624
I've ever heard of.

160
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,126
Yeah.

161
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,128
Well, I gotta go.

162
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,630
(quietly): Normie, walk me out.

163
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,634
I'm not leaving yet, Cliff.

164
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,635
Neither am I.

165
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,637
Ma and I want in.

166
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,640
In where?

167
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,142
Don't be naive, Normie.

168
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,027
Put me up for five shares.

169
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:54,363
No, no, no.

170
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,365
Investments are risky, Cliff.

171
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,367
Look, I never do business
with friends, all right?

172
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,237
Besides, it's 200 bucks a share.

173
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,872
Put me down for five, too, will ya?

174
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:06,209
Oh, great, Norm, now
the cat's outta the bag!

175
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,077
CARLA: I think you're all crazy.

176
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:10,379
But if Clavin makes
big bucks and I don't,

177
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,381
I won't be able to live with the shame.

178
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,749
Give me a share.

179
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,551
Oh, me, too! Me, too!

180
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:16,419
You, Diane?

181
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,221
Laying bets on a laundry?

182
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,722
Well, in my case, it's not a gamble,

183
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,724
but rather a show of faith

184
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,726
in our great free enterprise system.

185
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:26,729
Yes, even Diane Chambers is not immune

186
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,681
to the renaissance
of American patriotism

187
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,682
in the 1980s.

188
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,684
Although I hasten to remind you

189
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,187
this does not imply any
shifting of my support

190
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,688
toward the current administration.

191
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,107
I hope nobody was looking
for a silent partner.

192
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,994
CARLA: You know, Diane,

193
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,914
you shouldn't be investin'
in a tanning salon.

194
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,415
You oughta be usin' one.

195
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,784
You got skin the color of Elmer's glue.

196
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,121
I happen to have

197
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:58,127
what Restoration poets
refer to as "alabaster skin."

198
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,130
Well, at least your hair looks nice.

199
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,135
Besides, with my rendezvous
with Chad coming up,

200
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,137
I dare not risk freckling.

201
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:09,138
Why not? If it got boring,

202
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,641
you could always
play connect-the-dots.

203
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:15,027
God, how this must torment you.

204
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,447
No, no, no, come on, Norm.

205
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,949
You gonna let us in or not?

206
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,450
Let's just change the
subject, all right?

207
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,736
Hey, he's tryin' to sidetrack us.

208
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,038
This thing must be a gold mine.

209
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,041
Yeah, yeah, hey, Normie,
uh, correct me if I'm wrong,

210
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,543
but yesterday you had a letter

211
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,544
you needed mailed.

212
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,464
I did it, and you can at
least return the favor.

213
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,966
Cliffie, that's your job.

214
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:37,967
Well, all right.

215
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,969
Then, as one
professional to another--

216
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,220
come on, Norm!

217
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,755
(all pleading)

218
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,556
I know what's gonna happen!

219
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,057
I know what's gonna happen.

220
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,926
Somethin's gonna go wrong
and you're all gonna blame me.

221
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,344
(all protesting)

222
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,346
All right, well, well.

223
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,098
All right, yes! Whoo! Whoo!

224
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,432
Hey, Wood, do you want in?

225
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,818
I don't think so.

226
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,570
You know, when I left home,

227
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,855
my father gave me
some very sound advice.

228
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,359
"Never trust a man who
can't look ya in the eye.

229
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,361
"Never talk when you can listen.

230
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,864
"And never spend venture
capital on a limited partnership

231
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:11,867
without a detailed, analytical
fiduciary prospectus."

232
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,428
Afternoon, everybody.

233
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,263
ALL: Norm!

234
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,765
Hey, Norm, how's the
world been treatin' ya?

235
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,768
Like a baby treats a diaper.

236
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,275
So...

237
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,145
what's the deal with
the, uh, "Tan 'N Wash"?

238
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,030
For a new business, I'd say Tan 'N Wash

239
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,032
is doing as well as could be expected.

240
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,033
Oh, yeah?

241
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,534
I dropped by this morning

242
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,536
and the only customer in the place

243
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,538
was a lonely woman kicking the hell

244
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:50,906
out of a jammed change machine.

245
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,158
Oh, come on. By the way,

246
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,544
you owe me a quarter
and a new pair of shoes.

247
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:58,381
Patience, Carla, all right? Patience.

248
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,383
There are gray skies on the horizon.

249
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,385
Yeah, it's gonna get cold
and damp and miserable.

250
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:03,886
We'll be wading in customers.

251
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,389
Yeah, I think we're wading
in something right now.

252
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,257
I've worked out a great
new promotional campaign.

253
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,759
Promotional campaign? Yeah.

254
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,146
Whew! Hey, hey!

255
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,065
Check out Mr. Tan there, huh?

256
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,067
Say, Sammy,

257
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,436
did you just fly to the
tropics and spend a week

258
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:23,439
and thousands of dollars under
the blazing, unhealthy sun?

259
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:24,440
(dismissive laugh)

260
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,443
No, no, Norm. No, I
just spent my lunch hour

261
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:30,446
under some healthful,
federally approved UVA rays

262
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,831
at the Tan 'N Wash.

263
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,250
Say, those clothes are really
lookin' clean there, pal.

264
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,751
Well, thank you, Norm.

265
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,754
Yeah. Now is it true
that with these coupons

266
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,257
anyone can get 25% off on
their first five visits?

267
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,258
Well, that's what I hear.

268
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,259
Great.

269
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,013
Well!

270
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,297
Hey... I tell ya,

271
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,685
is that Cliff Clavin
or is that Don Ho, huh?

272
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,637
Uh...

273
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:55,638
Where ya been, buddy,

274
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:57,139
some, uh, faraway island resort?

275
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,141
Oh, easy mistake, Norm,

276
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,644
but, no, I got this tan
right here in Beantown.

277
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:03,646
Is that at the new Tan 'N Wash

278
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:04,647
I've been hearing so danged much about?

279
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:06,148
That's right, Normie.

280
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,650
And, by the way, did you realize

281
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,151
that the tan first gained popularity

282
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,037
in what is now known as the Bronze Age?

283
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,988
Great, great. Well, I'm sold.

284
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:15,991
Oh, and, by the way, look
how white I used to be.

285
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,798
You wore your socks
in the tanning booth?

286
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:25,301
Well, I, I gotta be careful, Sammy.

287
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:28,304
The Clavin men have, uh,
feet like a baby's bottom.

288
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:31,924
With faces to match.

289
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,725
Will you back off, Carla?

290
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,727
I don't see you pitchin'
in for the cause here.

291
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,594
Yeah, yeah?

292
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,562
Well, all I know

293
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,565
is I wouldn't stick a fork in a toaster,

294
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,067
never mind my valuables.

295
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,069
Come on, guys.

296
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,438
Uh, whatta you say we
snap up these flyers?

297
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,939
They can't last forever.

298
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,442
Wouldn't be so sure, Norm.

299
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,443
You know, Peterson,

300
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,862
you've got the guts of a burglar.

301
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,363
In here peddling a tanning salon

302
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,865
on the sunniest day of the year.

303
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,249
Outside of someone

304
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,584
with a financial interest in the place,

305
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,585
who'd be stupid enough

306
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,087
to spend a minute in
your rip-off joint?

307
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,618
You try to help out a few
newly enterprising friends

308
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,120
and what do you get for your trouble?

309
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,123
45 minutes in hell.

310
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,624
Sit. Keep it down, will ya?

311
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,625
Keep it down here.

312
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,010
Keep it down?

313
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,878
I've got the worst sunburn of my life,

314
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,880
thanks to a faulty thermo-regulator

315
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,882
on tanning machine number three,

316
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,384
the Bahama Mama.

317
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,302
Frasier,

318
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,305
you're supposed to start
off slowly, all right?

319
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,807
But I must say, you do have

320
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,308
one heck of a fantastic

321
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,810
base coat there, Fras.

322
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,695
Yeah. Yeah, and your, uh,

323
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,981
your shirt sure smells fresher.

324
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,232
Really?

325
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,533
It's not too lemony?

326
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,035
Not for you.

327
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,539
(humming "Isn't It Romantic")

328
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:18,547
(humming)

329
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,218
Sorry.

330
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,805
(humming)

331
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
Well, it's just that

332
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,810
it's such a lovely, sunny day out...

333
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,314
as your tanned faces will attest.

334
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,318
Well, I guess I'm feeling
especially girlish.

335
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
How come, Miss Chambers?

336
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
Nah, nah, nah, don't, don't.

337
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
You know, Woody--
the usual thing

338
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,330
that puts a bounce in a girl's step.

339
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
Ah! Support hose.

340
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,839
You're adorable.

341
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,341
No, I'm referring to

342
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,343
a very special evening.

343
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
Oh, yeah, yeah.

344
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,848
Didn't you have a date
or something last night?

345
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,351
You know perfectly
well I saw Chad, but--

346
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
it was no big deal.

347
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:19,358
(humming "Isn't It Romantic")

348
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah.

349
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,363
I refuse to ask her about last night.

350
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
You ask her, Woody.

351
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,366
Gotcha.

352
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,871
Well, looky here.

353
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,375
The paper predicts the same
high for Boston as Honolulu.

354
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,878
That is Honolulu, Hawaii,

355
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
the state where you can get
a free tan all year round.

356
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,798
Carla, if you're
trying to say something,

357
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,800
why don't you just
spit it out, all right?

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,803
Tan 'N' Wash bites it.

359
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,806
Okay, I'll admit Indian
summer's killing us temporarily,

360
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,174
but this is Boston.

361
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,643
It's gonna get cold.

362
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,146
(humming "Isn't It Romantic")

363
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,352
Hey, Sam.

364
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,854
I found out all about
Miss Chambers' date.

365
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,606
I mean, uh...

366
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,442
beautiful night of magic.

367
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,443
Just spill it, will ya, Woody?

368
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:16,448
Well, the ballet was exquisite,

369
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,450
but it paled by comparison

370
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,454
to the enchanting coach
ride under the stars.

371
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:27,459
Chad held her porcelain
- like hand lightly,

372
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,463
tracing tiny circles on her alamander...

373
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,464
Alabaster.

374
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,966
...alabaster skin,

375
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,972
and then, fearing that
the spell might be broken,

376
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,475
she invited him up
to her pied-de-teer

377
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,477
for some quiet conversation

378
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,479
and warm brandy, and then...

379
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,480
What?

380
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,482
Miss Chambers said if you want to hear

381
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,484
the rest, you gotta ask her yourself.

382
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,986
(laughing) Oh...

383
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,989
Forget it! Forget it, man!

384
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,490
Oh, ask her, Sam.

385
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,492
Sounds like you won't be disappointed.

386
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,994
Forget it.

387
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:09,084
Frasier, a sunburn?

388
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,804
No, I'm doing my impression
of a blood blister.

389
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,892
CARLA: Hey, Frasier.

390
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,645
You know, there's something I've
always been meaning to ask you.

391
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,146
What was your reaction

392
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,648
the first time you saw Diane naked?

393
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,649
(screams in pain)

394
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:35,611
Normie, I can't hold out any longer.

395
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,613
Ma's getting antsy.

396
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,615
The last time she
spent a thousand dollars

397
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,616
was on a house.

398
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,617
Cliff, I'm sorry.

399
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,118
I-I really am, but you guys

400
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,119
begged me to let ya in.

401
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,587
It's not like I didn't warn you.

402
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,955
CARLA: Oh, sure.

403
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,875
"Don't do this. I pray
to God you don't do this."

404
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,877
You call that a warning?

405
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,263
You know, I predicted this. You guys are

406
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,048
nervous Nellies and you're
trying to blame it all on me.

407
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,549
I want out, Norm.

408
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,550
Yeah, me, too.

409
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,436
Who wants a tan in the winter anyway?

410
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,854
Wait, wait. This is not the smart move.

411
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,855
You gotta hang in there.

412
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,356
You gotta roll with
the punches, all right?

413
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,858
You're gonna roll with the punches

414
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,109
if you don't get us outta this.

415
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,943
Nah, I just don't think

416
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
that we're cut out for it.

417
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,446
No. Apparently not, all right?

418
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,449
Yeah, geez, have it
your way, guys, okay?

419
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,950
Look, all right, I tell ya what. Okay?

420
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,453
I'll personally buy out
your shares, all right?

421
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,455
I'll have your checks in
the mail within a week.

422
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,824
Stupid mistake. Stupid.

423
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:23,208
Stupid.

424
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,752
Ooh, ooh, boy.

425
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,255
It's still snowing out there.

426
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,640
Yeah, and every flake means

427
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,927
another buck in Norm's pocket.

428
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,312
You, you guys still moaning

429
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,813
because Norm hit the
jackpot and you didn't?

430
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,815
Hey, come on, Paul, give us some credit

431
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,817
for being adults, huh?

432
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,320
Hey, what do you say we
toilet paper his house?

433
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,822
Nah, it'd only make it look better.

434
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,860
Sam, excuse me.

435
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,745
May I have your ear for a moment?

436
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,081
Sure. Just don't leave any bite marks.

437
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,834
Sam, I've decided

438
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,337
to break off my relationship with Chad.

439
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,288
Who?

440
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,041
What an actor you are.

441
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,843
You know, if you hadn't
chosen bartending,

442
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,711
you could well have had

443
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,463
a career in the theater.

444
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,931
Or as a model.

445
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,435
Anyway, you needn't continue

446
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,437
this charade of nonchalance.

447
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,439
I'm ending my affaire de coeur

448
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,443
because I can sense how it's
secretly gnawing away at you.

449
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,948
Okay. all right.

450
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,449
I'm glad.

451
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,452
All I've been able to
think about is you and Chad.

452
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,788
In your apartment.

453
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,541
In his car, on the stairs.

454
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,044
Doing things even we never did.

455
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,412
I mean, I can't eat,

456
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,330
I can't sleep.

457
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,714
Oh, Sam. Really?

458
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,551
Gee, maybe I could have been an actor.

459
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,919
Oh!

460
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:01,807
Afternoon, everybody.

461
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:06,929
Norm!

462
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:09,932
Norman.

463
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,435
How're you feeling today, Norm?

464
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:14,436
Rich and thirsty.

465
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:15,437
Pour me a beer.

466
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,440
Yes, sir, Mr. Peterson.

467
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,326
Boy, you sure have
gotten successful, huh?

468
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,112
Well, Woody, you know what
they say about success.

469
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,999
It's one percent inspiration
and 99 percent perspiration.

470
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
So is your shirt.

471
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,118
Yeah, and you know what else they

472
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,088
say about success
there, Mr. Rockeflounder?

473
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,625
It's lonely at the top.

474
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,927
Yeah, but the food's better, Cliff.

475
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,763
Hey, you don't have to rub

476
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,764
our noses in it, man.

477
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,133
I mean, we're your friends, after all.

478
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,101
Friends?

479
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,103
You call yourselves friends?

480
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,605
The last four or five
times I've walked in here,

481
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,607
you treat me as if I've
done something wrong.

482
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,811
You know, not one of
you guys has bothered

483
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,196
to congratulate me for my success.

484
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,314
Which, I might add, you all had

485
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,483
a chance to share in.

486
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:05,954
Maybe I should just take my
refreshment business elsewhere.

487
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,957
When I think of all the
hours I wasted in here

488
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,460
when I could have been
wasting them somewhere else.

489
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
DIANE: Norman, Norman.

490
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,963
Please don't leave.

491
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,965
We're taking it out on you,

492
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,967
but we're really mad at ourselves.

493
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,970
The hostility you're feeling
is for our own stupidity

494
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,472
at bailing out of this project.

495
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,340
Right, everyone?

496
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,729
You guys are beautiful.

497
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,731
Oh, well, come on, wait a second.

498
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,900
Come on back here.

499
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,184
Yeah, we've been actin'
like creeps, Normie.

500
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,403
CARLA: I'll fluff up
your favorite stool.

501
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,689
Yeah, I'll open a fresh bag of pretzels.

502
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:41,690
And I'll pour you a beer

503
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,692
just the way you like
it-- within reach.

504
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,863
What we're trying to say here is,

505
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:48,747
we're sorry.

506
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,748
CLIFF: Yeah.

507
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,500
You had the guts to stick it out,

508
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,702
and we didn't, and you deserve

509
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,921
all the success now.

510
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,173
Thank you, Sam. Guys.

511
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,175
I'm really glad to
hear that because, uh,

512
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,677
I have a little surprise for you guys.

513
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,679
I never took you out
of Tan 'N' Wash at all.

514
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,180
And here are your first dividend checks

515
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,181
right here, huh?

516
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,683
Oh, Norman!

517
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,184
You're kidding me.

518
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,186
(all talking excitedly)

519
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,189
ALL: ? For he's a jolly good fellow ?

520
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,191
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow, ♪

521

522
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,561
WOODY: Cheers.

523
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:20,312
It's for you.

524
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,196
Put 'em on hold.

525
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,567
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

526
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,451
Hey. All right.

527
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,452
This is great.

528
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
Hey, look at that! It's snowing

529
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,038
even harder out now.

530
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,290
Oh, it's a harbinger

531
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,624
of good fortune!

532
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,376
You said it, bone butt!

533
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,798
Snow today means dough tomorrow.

534
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,583
Hey, let's carry Mr. Peterson

535
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,085
around the bar on our shoulders

536
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,087
and then go play in the snow.

537
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,089
Let's go play in the snow.

538
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,590
Hold it! Hold it!

539
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,592
Last one out's a Clavin.

540
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,595
No, you're not. You're
not gonna get me this time.

541
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:58,100
Oh, I'm always the Clavin.

542
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,604
Ah, Woody. Woody, Woody, Woody.

543
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,989
Look at them, huh?

544
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,940
Isn't that great?

545
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,825
They're singin' and dancin'.

546
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,744
It gives me a great feeling all over

547
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,612
to do something good for those people.

548
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,448
Oh, speaking of people,
you got one on hold here.

549
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,422
Hello. Yeah, hi.

550
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,923
Oh, no. No.

551
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,925
No, get out. No!

552
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,427
What're you...?

553
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,928
No, man, no!

554
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,930
No...

555
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,931
Well, at least we...

556
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,933
No?!

557
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,936
We, no, but wait a, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

558
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,943
Bad news, Mr. Peterson?

559
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,647
Wrong number, Woody.

560
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,949
Aren't those annoying?

561
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,968
(all yelling, laughing)

562
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,971
Uh... Huh! Guys! Good friends!

563
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,474
Listen, people, uh, excuse me!

564
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,976
Listen, I know things have
been going just beautifully,

565
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,845
but, uh, hey, would you stop jumping

566
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:19,181
up and down for a second?!

567
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,682
Thank you.

568
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:23,685
Now let's just take a
hypothetical situation.

569
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:26,688
Just for fun, let's just
say that the roof collapsed

570
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:29,191
over at Tan 'N' Wash from
the weight of all this snow

571
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,693
and by some little quirk we
didn't have any insurance.

572
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,695
How would you guys feel about that, huh?

573
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,702
Just checking.
