00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,100
No, I don't                     
remember her name.

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,300
        (wind whistling)        

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,700
                          Sammy?

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,000
                     Yeah. Yeah.
It's Mike Dukakis.

00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,900
                            SAM:
                        Yeah.   
        It's Michael Dukakis.   

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,500
                    Let's go say
                hello to him.   
    We can't.                   

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!   
            What'll we call him?

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,800
            What'll we call him?
Uh, Governor.                   

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,800
                Ex. Ex-governor.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,300
Ooh, yeah. Your Honor.          
There you go.                   

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,000
                     You... Your
                    Ex Honor.   
No, no, no, no, no.             

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,000
                    Yeah.       
             Mike.              

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,200
                    Michael.    
    Duke! Duke,                 
    Duke, Duke!                 

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
            Duke! Duke! Duke!   

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,600
Hi. How're you doing?           
                            SAM:
                             Hi.

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,100
              Hi.               

18
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,600
        (both laughing)         

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,900
                We said hello to
                Michael Dukakis!

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,300
  No, no, we said hi to Mike!   

21
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
                Michael.        

22
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
                         No, no.
                     Duke. Duke.

23
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,600
      Duke. Duke. We said       
         hello to Duke.         

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,500

25
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,200
 Takes everything you've got  

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,900
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

28
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
 Sure would help a lot         

29
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,200
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,800
   Sometimes you want to go    

31
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,200
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,200
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,200
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,700
   People are all the same     

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,300
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

          Oh! Uh, uh.           
        Excuse me.              

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,100
             Excuse me, Rebecca.

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,500
                    Uh, 2:15.   

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
    Hey, Sammy, here you go.    

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,800
                  Thanks, Carla.

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,100
     Phew! That was close.      

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,300
    What the hell was that?     

47
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,500
    Sammy's vitamin E.          

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,900
     It's Valentine's Day.      

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
                    Duh!        

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,700
Oh, yeah.                       

51
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,300
That's that stupid date         
he goes on once a year          

52
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,100
with that-- what is that--      
Lauren person.                  

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,500
                        NORM:   
                         Stupid?

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,200
                This is not some
        stupid date, Rebecca.   

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,500
                    For the last
                    20 years,   

56
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,100
Sammy and Lauren have met       

57
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
    for one night each year.    

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
It's kind of like Sammy's       
     version of commitment.     

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,900
                    Actually,   

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
        it's a lot like         
 <i>my</i> version of commitment.      

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
                            SAM:
                     Hey, Carla,

62
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,500
how long have you had this      
bottle of vitamin E around, huh?

63
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
                I don't know.   
                A while. Why?   

64
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
What is with this date          
you go on every year?           

65
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,200
I mean, you know, to me,        
it just... it just seems silly. 

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
         (men gasping)          
                          Uh-oh!

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
         Come on, guys.         

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,900
         Guys, she just         
      doesn't understand.       

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,300
      You see, sweetheart, first
          time Lauren and I met,

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,100
                we went up to   
                 this cabin, and
                  we had a night

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,700
                that was totally
            romantic and erotic.

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,300
                I guess you'd   
                call that silly.

73
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,900
If you liked her so much,       

74
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
how come you only               
see her once a year?            

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
        I don't know. I don't   
          know. It was her idea.

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,500
                You know, she   
              never told me why.

77
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
        I keep meaning to ask   
         her, but then I forget.

78
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,500
    This year's going           
    to be different, though.    

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
    I'm gonna pin her down.     

80
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,500
No, I better not do that.       

81
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,100
  Actually, I'll forget again,  
            won't I?            

82
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
            Well, I still say   
            it's a stupid way   

83
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,900
                        to spend
                Valentine's Day.
Yeah, but                       

84
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,200
         that's 'cause          
     you don't have a date.     

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,100
    Oh, yeah? I happen          
         to have a date         

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
with two very sweet gentlemen-- 

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
         Ben and Jerry.         

88
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,900
                  Hey, you know,

89
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,700
             it's just a made-up
                 holiday anyway.

90
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,800
          You know, some big fat
            greeting card tycoon

91
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
              trying to get rich

92
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
off of dopey cards              
and candy hearts.               

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,900
Don't be depressed              
about that.                     

94
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,500
                     Yeah, maybe
                you're right.   

95
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,100
If you're gonna be depressed    
about anything,                 

96
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,300
it should be the fact           

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
that you're only making         
seven bucks an hour,            

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,800
your skin is starting           
to flake at the hairline,       

99
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,400
and you're a year closer        
to death.                       

100
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
            Thank you, Carla.   

101
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,700
        But, hey,               
if it makes you feel any better,

102
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,000
     Happy Valentine's Day!     

103
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,800
        Woody, a couple         
      of pitchers, please.      

104
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,900
        Sure, Dr. Crane.        

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,100
                Uh, if you're   
                     buying beer

106
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,600
                for your friends
            back there, Fras,   

107
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,300
                  you know, I'm,
            uh... I'm available.

108
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
            (laughs)            
            Well...             

109
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
        Actually,               
      they're not friends.      

110
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
  It's a therapy group I have   

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,500
    for men who have trouble    
    relating to women.          

112
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
                     (laughing):
                    Well, set   
                'em up, Wood.   

113
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,700
          Ah, Frasier.          

114
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Here you are.                   

115
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,000
            And where are the   
              dysfunctional men?

116
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,000
                Throw a rock.   

117
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
They're in the pool room.       

118
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
      Come along, ladies.       

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Why don't you go on ahead       
    into the poolroom and...    

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,600
 make yourselves as comfortable 
 as five women totally hostile  

121
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
  to their own bodies can be.   

122
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
                      After you.

123
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
            So, uh,             
  what's going on back there?   

124
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Well, Frasier and I are both    
treating same-sex groups        

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
with relationship disorders.    

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,000
And recent studies suggest      
that there are benefits         

127
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,400
to be gained by bringing        
these two groups together       

128
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
for interrelations              

129
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,100
under controlled                
social circumstance.            

130
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
        Say what?               

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,300
         Well, come on.         

132
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
         Surely you've all seen,
            uh, <i>Love Connection.</i>

133
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh!                             

134
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,600
G... Guys! Guys!                

135
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
  What are you doing out here?  

136
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
     Dr. Crane, there's...      
        there's...              

137
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,800
Yes, I know.                    

138
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,600
    There's girls in there.     

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,900
But you see,                    
you're missing the point.       

140
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,000
    This is exactly the type    
          of situation          

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
    we've been training for.    

142
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,700
 This time it's the real thing, 
     not just me in a wig.      

143
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,100
             Whoa!              
Man, those stairs are slippery. 

144
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
  Woody, I think we could use   
    a little salt out there.    

145
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,200
            These pretzels could
         use a little salt, too.

146
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,500
             My blood pressure's
            actually dipping.   

147
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,600
  Boy, those patients of mine   
      are really hopeless.      

148
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,100
                     Well, heck,

149
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,000
                      bring them
                    out here.   

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,900
                     This is the
                  hopeless room.

151
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,200
Yeah, I don't know, Dr. Crane.  
Haven't you ever thought        

152
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,000
that it's kind of tough on them,
doing all that counseling stuff?

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,200
I mean, I was raised to believe 
that if you have a problem,     

154
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,000
        you lock it away        
    in a secret place.          

155
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
     You keep it bottled up     
        good and tight.         

156
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
 And if it gets full in there,  

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
     you just keep forcing      
         the pain down          

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
      and clamping it in.       

159
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,700
      Good advice, Woody.       

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Tick, tick, tick.               

161
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,300
Well, guys, I'm all packed      
and ready to go.                

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,700
                            Hey.
Hey.                            
                Hey.            

163
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,500
                You sure you got
                everything, Sam?

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,800
        Yup.                    

165
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,200
         And then some.         

166
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,100
                    Oh! Oh,     
                    you dog!    

167
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
                            Hey!
                        You dog!

168
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,300
        Well, hey,              
        I'm out of here.        

169
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,700
No, no, no.                     

170
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,900
                  No, you don't,
                     Sam Malone!

171
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
SAM:                            
What?                           

172
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
                  You don't just
                      leave here

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
 on your 20th-anniversary date  
  with Lauren just like that.   

174
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,600
    We got something special    
cooked up for you. Carla,       

175
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
hit it.                         

176
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
        (fanfare plays)         

177
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,900
      Ah, look at him go.       

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
So proud,                       

179
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
so majestic,                    

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
        so regal.               

181
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
    (thudding, Sam grunting)    

182
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,100
                          CARLA:
                          Woody,

183
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,500
                you never salted
        those steps, did you?   

184
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Hey, I'll get to it.            

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
          Let me see.           

186
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,500
                 I don't believe
             there's a fracture,

187
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
        just a serious sprain   
      right around lumbar three.

188
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,300
                    Does it hurt
                 when I do this?

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
        (groaning)              

190
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,700
                    That's good.
                    That's good.

191
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,200
    Ooh. Why? Does that mean    
     I'm gonna get better?      

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,900
     No. Because it means I know
         what I'm talking about.

193
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,400
        You see, Lilith, I could
     <i>so</i> have been a real doctor.

194
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,900
Hey, give me a hand here,       
        will you, Woody?        

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, geez.                       

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Time's a-wastin',               
my friend.                      

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,700
             Oh, Sam, you're not
              seriously thinking

198
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
            of still going on   
             this date, are you?

199
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,400
         You bet I am.          
                        NORM:   
                      All right!

200
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
         (men cheering)         

201
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,200
Sam, I seriously                
urge you                        

202
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,900
to stay off your feet           
and in bed.                     

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
            Well, that's <i>part</i> of
          the plan, there, Fras.

204
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,900
Hey, Woody, can you do me       
     one tiny little favor?     

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,300
                      Sure, Sam.
                     What is it?

206
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,700
  Can you get me up to my car,  
then drive me to Vermont,       

207
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,300
          then get me           
        into the cabin?         

208
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,500
                    What's in   
                      it for me?

209
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,200
Well, you could use             
that new gas card of yours      

210
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
to fill the tank.               

211
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,900
        All right!              
     I'll feel so grown up!     

212
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
                 All right, Sam.

213
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,700
                 I'm gonna drive
                you up there,   

214
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,300
            and I don't want you
         to worry about a thing.

215
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,600
                      I'm a very
                    good driver.

216
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,900
Great. Great.                   

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,900
Just go, please.                

218
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,900
         Ding, ding, ding.     

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,600
What are you doing?             

220
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,600
    "The captain is requesting  

221
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,300
    that all passengers please  
fasten their safety belts."     

222
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
              Oh.               

223
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
(groans)                        

224
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,400
C-Can you get that              
for me, please?                 

225
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
                      Sure, Sam.

226
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
                Where is that   
                      seat belt?
        (grunts)                

227
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
                     Here it is.

228
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,900
                        Ow!     

229
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,400
                      That hurt!

230
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,600
        I'm sorry.              

231
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,800
      (clicking seat belt)      

232
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,900
                  Nice and snug.

233
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,100
                     Here we go.

234
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
      (car engine starts)       

235

236
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
                  parking brake,

237
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
                 mirror, signal.

238
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,600
     (turn signal clicking)     

239
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,800
                     Blind spot.

240
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,700
                        Vermont,

241
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,200
         here we come.          

242
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
        (brakes squeal)         
                Lord have mercy!

243
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
What? What happened? Aah!       

244
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,800
            Well, I didn't think

245
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,900
        that pigeon was gonna   
            fly away in time.   

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,300
         Why do they always wait
        till the last minute?   

247
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,600
             What, do they think
      that's funny or something?

248
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Aw, I don't know, Woody...      

249
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,500
                  All right. All
            right, Sam, hang on.

250
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
  We're gonna pull out again.   

251
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,200
  Mirror, signal, blind spot.   

252
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,700
     (turn signal clicking)     

253
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
                          There.

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,300
        "Exit 19.               

255
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,700
                Concord Street."

256
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,700
                      "Exit 20."

257
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,100
                    "Route 125."

258
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,800
    Woody...                    

259
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,100
                Hang on, Sam.   

260
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
                     "93 North."

261
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Oh, no, please,                 
don't read all the road signs.  

262
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,700
                  Oh, fine, Sam.

263
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
    Would you like me           
to ignore the speed limit, too? 

264
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,100
        I wouldn't mind         
     if you approached it.      

265
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
        Meow, Sam.              

266
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,300
        (rattling)              

267
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
Sam, I hear some rattling.      

268
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
                    Is your door
             closed all the way?

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
         No, it's not.          

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,300
    Here, I'll get it.          

271
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,800
                No, no, hang on.
                     I-I'm gonna

272
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,600
            pull over as soon as
            I make this turn.   

273
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,400
(sighs)                         
                  No, don't undo
                 your seat belt!

274
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,800
Give me a break.                

275
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,100
Will you lighten up?            

276
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Whoa!                           
(thudding)                      

277
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,200
    Now would that have happened

278
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
        if you'd been wearing   
            your safety belt?   

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,500
                    Now boys,   
                    girls,      

280
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,700
                I have an orange
                  under my chin.

281
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,600
        I am going to attempt to
pass it to this lovely woman,   

282
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,800
             whom I do not fear.

283
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,100
                    Now you see,
                 isn't that fun?

284
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
        Whoa!                   

285
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,800
              Now, why don't you
             have a crack at it?

286
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,100
     Edward, how about you?     

287
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,600
            Come on.            

288
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
          Here we are.          
         That's lovely.         

289
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
          Okay. Ready?          

290
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,000
        Yes. Good, good,        
        good, yes.              

291
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,100
I don't think I want            
to do this, Dr. Crane.          

292
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,000
                  Oh, all right!

293
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,600
              And what would you
             suggest that we do?

294
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
     Stare at one another?      

295
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,400
Lord knows you've all had       
    enough practice at that!    

296
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,900
            You're pressuring   
                them, Doctor.   

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh, you're right, darling. Uh...

298
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,300
You know, perhaps               
we should try                   

299
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,700
a different approach.           

300
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,500
              You know, there is

301
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,400
a technique pioneered           
in the early 60's,              

302
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,800
which is thought                
to be without peer              

303
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,500
in producing the social         
effect that we seek.            

304
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm referring,                  
of course, to...                

305
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,100
      Twister!                  

306
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,000
            LILITH:             
        Left foot blue.         

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,900
          (door opens)          

308
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
                Oh, yeah.       

309
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,100
 Ah, this place is going to see 
      some action tonight.      

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,100
        Oh, Sam, you've still   
             got a little gravel

311
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
            stuck to the back   
                of your neck.   

312
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah? Well, I like              
it like that.                   

313
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,500
Just get me                     
on the bed there.               

314
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
You can take off and come       
pick me up in the morning.      

315
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,300
    (car approaching)           

316
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,300
    Oh, hey, that's             
    Lauren's car there.         

317
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
Oh, great! I'm really looking   
         forward to meeting her.

318
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,200
No, no, man. You g...           
you got to get out of here.     

319
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,000
If she sees you, she's gonna    
think something's wrong.        

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
It'll ruin the mood.            
Just quick-- get out the window.

321
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,700
    Go on!                      
                Oh, sure.       

322
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
        "Quick, out the window."

323
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,000
    Not exactly the undying     
      thanks and gratitude      

324
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,400
  I might expect after driving  
  200 miles through the snow.   

325
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,100
     Would you just shut up     
      and move your butt?       

326
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,200
  Oh, that's much better, Sam.  

327
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
      That'll keep me warm      
    on the drive home.          

328
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,700
Sam, there's a door here.       

329
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Why'd I go                      
out the window?                 

330
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
  Would you get out of here?!   

331
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,200
             Go on!             

332
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,200
  Happy Valentine's Day, Sam.   

333
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,300
 Happy Valentine's Day, Lauren. 

334
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
          Aww... wait.          

335
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,100
  Why? Wh-what are you doing?   

336
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,300
 I want to get a running start. 
No-no!                          

337
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,600
        No! No! Lauren!         

338
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,400
            Nooooo!             

339
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,000
      Now you have to play      
         by the rules.          

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,700
     The bottle is clearly      
    pointing at Jill.           

341
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,900
                 Now, Jules, you
            have to kiss her.   

342
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,300
            I pass.             

343
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,500
         For the hundredth time,
                you cannot pass!

344
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,700
         Okay, I quit.          

345
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,900
            Perhaps it's time   
        we admit our failure.   

346
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,000
    It was a well-intentioned   
                     experiment,

347
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,800
              but we realize now
        that you're not ready   

348
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,700
                for this type of
             social interaction.

349
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,500
             I guess we can only
             conclude by saying,

350
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
                  "Oh, well."   

351
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
            FRASIER:            
              No!               

352
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
    I'm not giving up!          

353
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,000
            How difficult can it
             be to kiss a woman?

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
        Be a little assertive   
          for once in your life!

355
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
                 Now you see how
        easy that was? Again.   

356
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
                    Again!      

357
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
                Class dismissed.
                  Let's go, hon.

358
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,000
         (Lauren moans)         

359
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,700
        Sam, is something wrong?

360
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Mm-mm, why?                     

361
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,900
         You're biting your lip.
Mm.                             

362
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,600
    Usually, you bite my lip.   
    (chuckles)                  

363
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
        I'm sorry.              

364
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,000
I have an idea.                 
              Ow!               

365
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,800
      (sultry music plays)      

366
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,400
      Let's dance the way       
        we used to, Sam.        

367
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
        (chuckles)              

368
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,600
      You know something,       
        we always dance.        

369
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,200
W-Why don't we just, uh...      

370
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,700
     why don't we just sit      
        very still, huh?        

371
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah, i-it could become         
a new tradition for us.         

372
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,900
                Come on, Sam,   
            let's slow dance.   

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,700
        (grunts):               
              No!               

374
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,900
             You like that, huh?

375
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,600
Hey, I've got a great idea here.

376
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Let's, uh, tell you what.       

377
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,000
You want to learn that new dance
that's sweeping Boston?         

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,100
                    I'm game.   
                  What do we do?

379
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,100
The guy kind of stands          
like this, very still.          

380
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,400
     And sometimes              

381
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,600
he leans up against something.  

382
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,500
And pretty soon his legs        
start to tremble.               

383
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,100
                 Sort of the way
                  yours are now.

384
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,300
      Yeah, yeah.               

385
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
There, you like it?             
(snapping fingers)              

386
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,200
                 Well, what does
                    the girl do?

387
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,400
 Usually she runs for some ice. 

388
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,300
    You don't want to dance,    
          do you, Sam?          

389
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,600
  No, you know, the truth is,   
        I really don't.         

390
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,900
     Sam, what's going on?      

391
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,700
    What do you mean?           

392
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,600
                     Never mind.

393
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
        I think I know.         

394
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
         (music stops)          

395
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,600
     I mean, it's obvious.      

396
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
    I'm not exactly as young    
as I used to be and, um...      

397
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,200
 Oh, sweetheart, wait a minute. 

398
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,800
 Wait, is that what you think?  

399
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,300
        Well, it's okay.        
     You can level with me.     

400
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,600
  I've gotten too old for you.  

401
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, no. Listen, age has nothing 
         to do with it.         

402
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
      You-- you are still       
    as young and sexy           

403
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,200
as that first day               

404
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,000
and night and next morning      
          that we met.          

405
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,300
          Really, Sam?          

406
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
    Then why are you acting     
        so standoffish?         

407
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah... oh, honey, I've got     
to level with you here.         

408
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
      Sweetie, I fell down      
        the steps today.        

409
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,500
      I threw my back out.      
    I can barely move.          

410
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
                Oh...           

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,500
        Well, I'm not surprised,
                 a man your age.

412
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,300
        Hey, look!              

413
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,200
         That cute guy,         
    with the hairy knuckles,    

414
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,600
he just left me a five buck tip 
     inside this Valentine.     

415
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
                 How 'bout that?

416
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
            So what?            

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,200
      I thought that we...      

418
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,500
         didn't care...         

419
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
         about that...          

420
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
    stupid made-up...           

421
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
  Valentine corporate garbage.  

422
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,600
                     That's just
                 what losers say

423
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,800
        when they don't get any.

424
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,100
                  But I got one,
                and at 11:40.   

425
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
        Right under the wire.   

426
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,800
        Whoa, I almost pulled   
            a Rebecca that time.

427
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
  That's not very nice, Carla.  

428
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,100
                You're right.   

429
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,500
                      I'm sorry.

430
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,700
                I almost forgot.

431
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,000
            Guess who called you
             to wish you a Happy

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,900
                Valentine's Day?
              Who?              

433
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
                    Nobody!     

434
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,900
                 Well, don't you
        worry there, Rebecca.   

435
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,500
                Nobody's a loser
                    on this day.

436
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,700
        I'm not going to, uh,   

437
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,200
        let you leave the bar   
                empty-handed.   

438
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,700
What's this?                    

439
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,300
              It's a Valentine's
              card I got for Ma,

440
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,700
            but I, I think it   
            suits you better.   

441
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,400
      Gee, Cliff, thanks.       

442
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Hey! Carla!                     

443
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,900
         I did get one!         

444
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,300
        So, uh...               

445
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,700
  what am I gonna get for it?   

446
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
            What do you mean?   

447
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Eh, come on, baby,              
swing a little.                 

448
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,500
                     What?      

449
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,700
Well, according to Fras, uh,    

450
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
babes like guys                 
who are assertive.              

451
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,800
    Aw, come on,                

452
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Robin's not here,               

453
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,200
Sam's out of the picture.       

454
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,700
You've had the rest,            
now try the best.               

455
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,600
Happy Valentine's Day, Cliff.   

456
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,400
        Thank you.              

457
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,700
            Cliffie, uh, where--
                  where is ev...

458
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,900
                    Cliffie?    

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,700
                 (snaps fingers)

460
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
                    Cliffie!    

461
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,100
        Thank you.              

462
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,100
        I've had 20-20 vision   
                    all my life.

463
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
                Now when I go   
                to a restaurant,

464
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,100
          I have to have someone
            at the next table   

465
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,500
                hold the menu so
                  I can read it.

466
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
         (both chuckle)         

467
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,200
No, you know what the worst     
thing about old age is?         

468
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,100
It's when you get so old that   
the skin under your arms        

469
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,500
starts getting loose            
and hanging like turkey wattle. 

470
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,500
         I thought that         
    only happened to women.     

471
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,600
Yeah, that's what I meant.      

472
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,600
    I just, you know, I hate    
     to see it, that's all.     

473
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
             Has your doctor put
             you on a bran diet?

474
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Oh, yeah, God...                

475
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
        Oh, I tell you--        
    oh, thank you. Oh!          

476
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,700
    Last year was the worst.    

477
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,600
  You know, I went in for this  
        stomach problem.        

478
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,200
    Turned out I had a stone    
    the size of a golf ball.    

479
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,800
  Took me a month to pass it.   

480
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,100
Sam, has your hair              
started turning gray?           

481
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,600
    Hey, hey. You're getting    
    a little personal there.    

482
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
          Aren't you?           

483
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
                 Sam, look, it's
              getting light out.

484
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,200
                      We've been
              talking all night.

485
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
    Oh, hey, how about that?    

486
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
    Wow! You know, that's...    
        that's a first.         

487
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
      Kind of nice to know      
          that we have          

488
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
      something in common       
      besides our bodies.       

489
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
            Oh, yeah, we have   
            the deterioration   

490
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
                  of our bodies.
            Yeah.               

491
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,900
                  Well, I've got
             a long drive ahead.

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
     I better get started.      

493
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,500
      Oh, no. Wait, wait.       

494
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
  Wait a second here, listen.   

495
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,100
Honey, y-you can't go now.      

496
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,000
I mean, we barely spent         
the night together.             

497
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
W-Why can't you stay?           

498
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,900
    Oh, Sam, I would love to,   
    but you know how this works.

499
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,300
          Just one night a year.

500
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,900
        Yeah, but that's        
 a stupid rule, you know that?  

501
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
 I never have understood that.  

502
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
     W-Why can't you stay?      

503
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,900
    I have to get to Portland   
             by Presidents' Day.

504
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,400
            There's a linebacker
            I always meet there.

505
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,100
    You, you do this            
    with other guys?            

506
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,600
            Well, you have other
            women, don't you?   

507
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,700
Well, yeah, but not once a year.

508
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,900
    I mean, I thought I was     
        special to you.         

509
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,300
            Oh, Sam, you are.   

510
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,400
                You'll always be
                my Valentine.   

511
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,600
                     Next year. 

512
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,400
        Yeah, all right.        

513
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
            Bye-bye.            

514
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,800
Listen, I could start seeing you
    on Arbor Day, too.          

515
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,700
            Really?             
                         Mm-hmm.

516
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,000
        Oh, great!              

517
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,400
Don't you see another guy       
     on Arbor Day, though?      

518
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,500
             I did, but he died.

519
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
              How?              

520
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,700
                     Happy.     

521
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,200
          Okay, okay.           

522
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,900
          Yeah, yeah.           
     We'll do it next time.     

523
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,300
          Thank you...          

524
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:46,354
