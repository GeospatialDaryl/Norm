00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,799
TEACHER'S PET

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,269
Carla, might l have a word?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,989
l know how you always like
to poke fun at me and whatnot,

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,188
but l'd appreciate it if you stayed away
from one area l'm sensitive about.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,591
- That is my ears.
- l don't make jokes about your ears.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,675
Why would l make jokes about...
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,872
l never noticed
those satellite dishes before.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,113
l must have been distracted by the other
atrocities attached to your head.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,794
Just hear me out on this one, will you?

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,599
Last night
l went through my insurance policy

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,877
and l discovered that l'm eligible
for an ear tuck.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,874
lt's going to be hard enough to go
through without you razzing me.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,033
So all l want to ask is that you
please not make my life a living hell.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,637
- This really means a lot to you.
- lt's the most important thing in my life.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,917
Well, go ahead. Get it done. We'll see.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,873
One other thing, Carla. Would you
lay off about how l live with my mother?

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,033
Gee, you've got to give me something.
What am l going to tease you about?

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,714
l'm not the most tidy guy in the world.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,394
Oh, OK. l'll limit myself to that.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,836
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome. Your mother called.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,913
She said you left your earmuffs
in the driveway and no one can get out.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,550
That was a tidy tease.

23
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,356
Hey, everybody.

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,756
- What do you have there, Sam?
- Looks like books.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,232
Yeah, l guess you could call them books.
Something l've been meaning to read.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,997
Why don't you open one up so we can
see the little gingerbread house pop out?

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,350
You wasted your money on that one,
Sam.

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,193
You'll be disappointed with the ending.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,956
l'll be in my office.

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,630
- He locked his door.
- We're trapped out here with you.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,036
Sam never locks his door.

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,919
He's done that a few times this week.

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,834
He did it the other night, never made
a sound. Stayed till closing time.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,754
My God.
The thing l feared worst has happened.

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,037
Your living bra died of boredom.

36
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,914
This is no time for levity.

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,959
l think Sam might be drinking again.
l was afraid of this.

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,478
Day after day of watching
Frasier and me exulting in our joy

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,995
has driven him over the edge.

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,118
Come on, Diane.
l doubt seriously if he's drinking.

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,589
There's lots of things he could be doing.

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,910
Like what?

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,150
Maybe he's reading just like he said.

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,869
lt can't be that. l was once with Sam
when he was reading.

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,349
l'd recognise the sounds anywhere.

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,036
Well, there's one way
to ascertain whether he's drinking.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,031
l will smell his breath.

48
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,394
- Go away.
- Sam, it's Diane.

49
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,154
Go far away.

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,756
Sam, there's something important
l need to talk to you about.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,629
- All right, come in.
- The door is locked.

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,030
l wonder how that happened.

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,589
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello.

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,877
What are you doing?
Why are you sniffing like that?

55
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,994
- What's that?
- l told you, l had a book.

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,790
''The World And lts People.''
This is surprising, Sam.

57
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,034
The title doesn't contain the words
naughty, hot, or throbbing?

58
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,113
- l told you, it's just a book l'm reading.
- lt's not just a book. lt's a textbook.

59
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,876
- Are you back in school?
- Promise you won't tell anybody.

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,875
This is nothing to keep secret. This is
wonderful. Why are you concealing it?

61
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,589
lt's a little embarrassing.
A guy my age going back to school.

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,278
lt's not embarrassing! lt's noble and fine
and it's inspirational. Let's tell everyone!

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,796
No, come on.
You know how the guys make fun of me.

64
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,557
Sam, no one enjoys teasing you
more than l do and l refrained.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,552
That's true.
All right, what the hey, let's do it.

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,154
- l'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,551
- Unless...
- Unless what?

68
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,238
Sam, you're not doing this to impress me
and win me back, are you?

69
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,115
- No, l'm doing it for my diploma.
- l hope so.

70
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,717
lf this is part of some involved scheme
to get me back in bed with you,

71
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,996
you will be very disappointed.

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,720
Yeah, but you'll enjoy yourself.

73
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,837
Attention, everyone.
l have an announcement to make.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,518
Someone in Cheers is improving himself
and l want you all to know about it.

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,356
l knew it. Carla, you told Diane
about my ear job, didn't you?

76
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,913
Clifford, Carla didn't tell me anything.

77
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,435
Well, you were saying?

78
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,996
After a rather lengthy interruption,

79
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,597
Sam has decided to go back to school
and pursue his degree.

80
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,519
- You're getting your ears done, man?
- Where's your sense of humour.

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,956
- lt was a joke.
- Will you forget about that?

82
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,910
This is exciting news. Our Sammy is
going to attain his Bachelor of what?

83
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,389
- Art? Sciences?
- High school.

84
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,315
- His Bachelor... High school. What?
- l never graduated from high school.

85
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,549
ln my senior year l got a contract
to play Class A ball.

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,669
Spring training didn't start until February
and school didn't get out until June.

87
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,949
High school.

88
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,396
l always promised my parents
l'd go back and finish.

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,791
She was a lot happier
about this in the other room.

90
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,274
l spent a year of my life
being defiled by Dobie Gillis.

91
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,840
l'm terribly sorry.
l just assumed you meant college.

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,992
- l plan to go to college, too.
- Good.

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,029
Let me know when you get there so
l can leave the house without a veil.

94
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,597
Sam, why does a guy like you
want to go back to high school?

95
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,115
You got everything a man could want

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,829
and you dumped
the one thing no man wants.

97
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,797
l'm tired of being embarrassed
about being a dropout.

98
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,635
lt's nothing to be ashamed of.
A lot of famous people never graduated.

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,313
Name three.

100
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,516
According to ''The Book Of Lists'',

101
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,435
Thomas Edison, NoÃ«l Coward.
Cher never graduated.

102
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,509
- Cher?
- Absolutely. Never finished, Coach.

103
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,753
- l feel a lot better now.
- Why? You never finished either?

104
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,357
No, l was missing a couple
of those what-d'-you-ma-call-its?

105
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,637
- Units?
- No, years, Diane.

106
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,237
Do you think it would be a good idea
if l was going back to school?

107
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,436
l think it's a wonderful idea.

108
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,034
The two of you can go together.

109
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,078
Coach can make up classes he missed.
What do you think?

110
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,277
l'll have my hands full
getting me through.

111
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,273
lt'll be fun.
You'll have someone to study with.

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,231
Coach, l'm just taking geography.

113
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,756
lt's the last thing l have to complete
so l can get my diploma.

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,230
Sam, it would only be
a start for me, you know.

115
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,313
As a matter of fact, as l remember it now
l was very good in geography.

116
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,109
Or was it geometry?

118
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,748
Diane, give me a question in geometry.

119
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,357
What is the sum of the angles
in an isosceles triangle?

120
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,476
lt was geography.

121
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,436
- Hey, everybody.
- Clifford.

122
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,596
Diane. Well, take your last look
at a flawed Clifford.

123
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,671
Tomorrow l go under the knife.

124
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,479
Why don't you just go under the bus?

125
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,951
l'm talking about my operation, Carla.
l'm going to have my ears tucked back.

126
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,839
Save money
Put chewing gum behind them.

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,956
That doesn't work.

128
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,680
l mean that probably wouldn't work.

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,598
- Don't let me stop you. You're on a roll.
- Those are the only words l know.

130
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,194
You guys seem to be in a good mood.

131
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,876
You noticed?
We did great on our test tonight.

132
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,349
You both passed?

133
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,956
Passed? We both got A's again.

134
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,430
Once again we got
the two highest grades in the class.

135
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,436
Are we going
to study together tonight?

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,797
Listen, this exam's going to constitute
80% of our grades.

137
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,351
- What have l told you all semester?
- Oh, l know, l know.

138
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,476
Studying is for saps.

139
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,949
That's right. l'll be in my office.

140
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,237
- What was the test about, Sam?
- l don't know. l forget.

141
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,520
Wait a minute. You got an A on this test
and you don't know what it covered?

142
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,069
After a quiz, l like to empty out my head.

143
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,674
How? By blowing your nose?

144
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,956
l got an A, didn't l?

145
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,153
Coach, l am so impressed with you.

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,276
Thank you, Diane.

147
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,797
- Sam didn't retain much from the test.
- Yeah, but he does just great.

148
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,839
l never realised what a brain he is.
l study all the time.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,992
He sleeps in the classroom.
He never takes a note.

150
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,116
And still he gets the great grades.

151
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,829
No wonder he's Miss Purdy's favourite.

152
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,032
- Miss Purdy?
- Yeah, our beautiful school teacher.

153
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,996
And Sam is her favourite?

154
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,314
Well, l can't say that. But Sam's
the only one l ever saw her kiss.

155
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,838
- They kiss?
- Yeah, l saw them in the parking lot.

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,788
l was putting up a notice there
on the bulletin board.

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,554
With probing tongues?

158
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,437
No, Diane,
with a thumbtack and my thumb.

159
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,032
l can't believe he's sunk to these depths.
l curse the day l walked into this bar.

160
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,236
Then it's unanimous.

161
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,272
Sam Malone, this is absolutely...

162
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,513
- The worst thing l've ever done.
- The worst thing... Wait a minute.

163
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,309
You don't know what l'm going to say.
l found out you have been...

164
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,153
- Sleeping with my teacher.
- That's right.

165
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,357
That's not the worst part.
She also has been giving you...

166
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,479
- Good marks because of it.
- Yes.

167
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,758
Are you admitting
that you know it's wrong?

168
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,711
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah? Well, stop slouching.

169
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,955
Look what's happened to your posture.

170
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,270
- What?
- l needed something.

171
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,116
Gee...the whole thing
started so innocently.

172
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,070
l began dating her because she was
cute and because we hit it off.

173
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,630
l had no idea that l was going to get
better marks because of it.

174
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,954
l just was after some meaningless sex
and it's turned into something sleazy.

175
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,548
You know the old saying,
''The best laid plans of mice and scum...''

176
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,069
Yeah, boy, ain't that the truth?

177
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,994
l didn't realise anything was wrong
until l got these quizzes back.

178
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,756
lnstead of marking off wrong answers,
she'd say, ''Close enough. A plus.''

179
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,233
lt's a sad commentary
on our educational system

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,312
when a harlot
is allowed in the public schools.

181
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,634
lf l remember correctly, when we met
you were dating your professor.

182
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,316
For your information, l was a legitimate
A student in the classroom.

183
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,596
l never got good grades in the sack.

184
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,991
Don't worry.
l always gave you an E for effort.

185
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,510
l'm going to tell you what you have to do.

186
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,716
You won't like it, but you have to...

187
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,111
Call Miss Purdy
and tell her l want an honest grade.

188
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,794
Sit up straight!

189
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,080
l can't do that, Diane.
l'm not prepared to take the exam.

190
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,708
Well, Coach will help you.

191
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,749
Sam, you started out
with such noble intentions.

192
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,990
l hate to see you end up like this.

193
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,678
Yeah, l know you're right. Right after
l take the exam, then l'll call her.

194
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,196
Come on...

195
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,917
Maybe with Coach's help, l can get by.

196
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,917
Hello, Miss Purdy? lt's little
Sammy Malone from the third row.

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,792
Yeah, listen, Alana, about school,
l had this crazy thought.

198
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,269
l'm even embarrassed to mention it.

199
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,230
ls our relationship in any way
affecting the marks l've been getting?

200
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,949
Like making you
unconsciously change some of...

201
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,590
What? You are?

202
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,155
Well, that's nice, but...

203
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,713
Me? Yeah, l'm naked, too.

204
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,157
Sounds like we're ready
for the class photo.

205
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,234
No, there's no one here.
lt was an insect, but l killed it.

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,110
Listen, l'm serious about this.

207
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,115
l would like my grade to be based
on my knowledge of geography.

208
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,430
No, l mean it.

209
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,795
Did l say something funny?

210
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,554
When you see the results of my tests,

211
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,190
you're going to be laughing out
the other side of your hemisphere.

212
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
Excuse me, l've got studying to do.

213
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,709
ls there anything in particular
l should cram?

214
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,031
All right, but remember, l gave you
that one as a going-away present.

215
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,990
Boy, that lady has got a mean mouth
on her for a 73-year-old.

216
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,232
l was joking, l was joking! Hey, Coach!

217
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,995
- Where's Coach?
- He's in the back, Sam. What's wrong?

218
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,277
Nothing. l've got to study
for this exam. lt's important.

219
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,796
- l'd be happy to help you study, Sam.
- l'd be proud to assist.

220
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,873
Are you kidding me? You can't help me.
You know squat about geography.

221
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,113
Coach, could you help me study?
We've got to start studying now.

222
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,430
l thought you didn't need anybody.

223
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,593
He does now. While you were earning
your grades with hard work,

224
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,830
Sam earnt his by dating the teacher.

225
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,752
ls that true, Sam?

226
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,593
Yeah, but l've wiped
the slate clean, Coach.

227
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,435
Whatever l get now, l have to earn,
so please help me cram.

228
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,833
You mean all semester long,
l've been wearing my buns to the bone

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,356
while you've been polishing
the teacher's apple?

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,117
Come on, Coach.
l want to get my diploma.

231
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,955
You know that whatever l get in this
exam is my grade for the class.

232
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,759
Find yourself another sap to study with.

233
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,993
- Come on, Coach.
- No way. l'm going.

234
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,473
Oh, my God, l need help. Carla,
what do you know about geography?

235
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,154
l know what creek you're up.

236
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,949
Hey, guys,
would you help me study for this quiz?

237
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,272
Maybe you could just go over the facts
with me or something?

238
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,230
l'm sorry, Sam. l think we're too dumb
to help. Don't you, Norm?

239
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,190
l didn't even understand the question,
Cliffie. l want to go home, l think.

240
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,557
- l'll go home.
- Yeah, left.

241
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,716
Right. Left. Right. Left. Right.

242
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,997
- l can't even do that.
- Let's go home, Norm.

243
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,719
l guess that just leaves
you and me, huh?

244
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,793
Oh, dear, Sam. This is a problem.

245
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,114
Frasier and l have tickets for a piece
of experimental theatre tonight.

246
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,037
l feel obligated to go because the last
act takes place in Frasier's living room.

247
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,990
- l'd hate to have you miss that.
- lf you want me to cancel out, l will.

248
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,188
No, it's too late. You can't help me.
l'm going to fail this exam.

249
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,909
l wonder if Miss Purdy's still naked. No...

250
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,115
OK, Sam, l'll help you. You always
mess up and l always bail you out.

251
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,910
You mess it up and l bail you out.
lt's getting a little boring.

252
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,116
- l'm telling you.
- Thanks, Coach.

253
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,989
- Don't you think it's getting boring?
- Yes, Coach.

254
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,950
The only thing l can say is that Sam's
lucky to have such a forgiving friend.

255
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,475
- Thank you.
- Good night.

256
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,432
You can learn about anything in this
world if you just follow my little trick.

257
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,477
Got it?

258
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,995
Albania. Here, Albania.

259
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,713
Or...

260
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,069
- should we say Albania?
- Why did you say it like that?

261
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,712
We learn our facts by associating
countries with music.

262
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,677
Why?

263
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,508
- Do you want to study alone?
- No.

264
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,750
One, two, three...

265
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,040
Albania, Albania

266
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,513
You border on the Adriatic

267
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,834
Your land is mostly mountainous

268
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,755
And your chief export is chrome

269
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,549
You're a communist republic,
You're a red regime

270
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,553
Sing it, Sam. Ready?

271
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,475
Albania, Albania

272
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,078
You border on the Adriatic...

273
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,351
Cliffie, l thought you were getting
your ears done today.

274
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,795
l decided this is the way God made me.

275
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,394
Who am l to question His judgement?

276
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,870
You were wrong about the insurance
company covering it?

277
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,996
Mostly that.

278
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,713
Taiwan, Taiwan on the sea

279
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,030
That China Sea

280
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,912
Listen up, everybody! l got an A in the
tests and the best grades in the class.

281
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,839
- How did you do, Sam?
- l got nosed out by Coach. l got a D.

282
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,279
Ladies and gentlemen, Sam Malone
is now a high school graduate.

283
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,114
- Congratulations.
- For what?

284
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,636
- You passed.
- Yeah, a D as in dumb.

285
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,033
A D as in diploma.
An honest D is better than a tainted A.

286
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,517
Boy, l tell you, l may have my diploma,
but l sure feel dumber than ever.

287
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,674
l studied myself hoarse for that exam
and still l got a D.

288
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,796
Sam, you only had one night to study.

289
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,795
lt makes no difference. My brain doesn't
work like yours. l can't learn things.

290
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,389
Sam, some people may be better
students than others,

291
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,074
but you have street smart, savvy...

292
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,390
- Common sense.
- That's right.

293
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,792
Just because you can't remember
Pierre is the capital of North Dakota

294
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,110
doesn't mean that you should feel...

295
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,477
- Wait a minute. Say that again.
- What?

296
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,473
- The capital of North Dakota.
- Pierre.

297
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,154
No, it isn't. lt's Bismarck.

298
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,198
Pierre, South Da...
What difference does it make?

299
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,353
- The point is you have earned your...
- Pierre?

300
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,116
l can't believe this.
North Dakota, Pierre?

301
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,431
Hey, listen to this for a second.
Go on, tell them.

302
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,556
l was just making an illustration.

303
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,995
What's the capital of North Dakota?

304
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,152
- Easy. Bismarck.
- She thinks it's Pierre.

305
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,113
All right, l may have inadvertently
switched the two.

306
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,352
- Oregon. Give me the capital of Oregon.
- Portland.

307
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,637
- No, it isn't. lt's Eugene.
- l knew that.

308
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,509
- lt just slipped my mind.
- lt isn't Eugene. lt's Salem.

309
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,310
Do you believe this?

310
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,318
lgnorance is bliss. This is Eden.
