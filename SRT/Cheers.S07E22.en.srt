Good evening, Mr. Clavin.       

3
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,990
  How lovely to see you again.  

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:10,659
    It's a trick, isn't it?     

5
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,326
You're gonna hurt me.           

6
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:13,762
          Yeah, what's          
     the story here, Carla?     

7
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:15,429
    You've been acting          
very strange all evening.       

8
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,298
             Why? What did I do?

9
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,000
    Well, for example,          
  you've poured me three beers  

10
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:21,469
     without once flicking      
     the foam up my nose.       

11
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:24,372
You haven't even                
spit on anybody.                

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:25,874
              What is it, honey?

13
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,809
                Trouble at home?

14
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:30,678
        All right,              
    I'm gonna tell you guys.    

15
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:32,647
         I went to see          
Madam Lazora this morning.      

16
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:34,015
Your fortune teller?            

17

                Palmist.        

18
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,554
        Anyway, she told me that
my courtesy to others tonight   

19
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,691
                    could result
          in substantial wealth.

20
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,325
                  Ah.           
And I'm                         
telling you,                    

21
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,194
              tonight I'm taking
                     no chances.

22
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:47,863
     What, you're not even      
    going to insult anybody?    

23
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,265
        Well, not unless        
     I can do it so subtly      

24
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,200
      that he doesn't know      
      he's been insulted.       

25
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,803
     No, tonight the bigger     
    jackass a guy is,           

26
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,073
    the more courteous          
         I am gonna be.         

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,042
  I'll start with numero uno.   

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,313
 Now, I do hope you'll allow me 
    the incredible privilege    

29
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:08,116
                  of serving you
             a beer, Mr. Clavin.

32
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:22,663
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

33
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:27,602

        glad you came          

34
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:30,305
         You want to be        
      where you can see

You're in early                 
tonight, Frasier.               

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,814
        Yes, I'm meeting        
      a former colleague,       

40
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,283
    Dr. Lawrence Crandell,      
    for a pre-dinner drink.     

41
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,534
                    He's in town
                 on a book tour.

42
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,436
        Oh, yeah?               
      He's a writer, huh?       

43
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:03,355
        Ooh, I should say so.   

44
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:05,089
        He's written a raging   
                    best seller.

45
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:06,725
        You know, if I wasn't   
            so thoroughly happy 

46
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,326
         in my own life, I might
             even stoop to being

47
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,595
        just a bit envious of   
              a former colleague

48
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,797
             who's now so widely
                     successful.

49
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,532
                Well, that is if
             you measure success

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,101
        by dollars and cents,   
      popularity, personal fame.

51
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,237
              I'm happy for him.

52
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,538
     What's the book about?     

53
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:21,589
            Who gives a damn?   

54
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:25,176
            Sorry. It's, uh,    
              a marriage manual.

55
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,979
         It's entitled, the, uh,
             <i>The Forever Couple:</i>

      Ah, science-fiction.      

59
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,736
Those usually sell great.       

60
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,638
     But you know, success      
    does have its price tag.    

61
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:38,306
         He's been away         
    from his wife, Valerie,     

62
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,007
 for the better part of a year. 

63
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,509
        Jeez, you know,         
      I think I'd go crazy      

64
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:43,211
         if I was away          
from Lilith for that long.      

65
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,779
          I don't even          
    like to think about it.     

66
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,013
                 Yeah, I'll bet.

67
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,165
Well, I do think about it.      

68
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,068
    I don't enjoy it.           

69
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,069
                I'm sure not.   

70
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,837
  Well, I do enjoy it, but...   

71
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,073
I'm not proud of the fact.      

72

73
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,512
 Larry, good to see you again.  

74
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,747
        Good to see you.        

75
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,149
             Have I told you how
                thrilled I am   

76
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,316
            about the success   
                of your book?   

77
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,084
    Yes, you have.              

78
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,051
        It's a fabulous book.   

79
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,219
                    You know,   
             I was just thinking

80
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,587
                what a wonderful
             gift it would make.

81
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,822
Have you read it?               

82
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,024
          Well, no, I was hoping
    someone might give it to me.

83
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,292
                  Let me get you
                        a drink.

84
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,161
          Oh, thanks,           
     black and white, neat.

00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,929
FRASIER:                        
Ah, Lawrence,                   

86
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,847
this is Rebecca Howe.

Crandell.                       

88
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:21,983
How do you do?                  
        Pleased to meet you.    

89
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,117
And this                        
is Sam Malone.                  

90
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,853
    Oh, not <i>the</i> Sam Malone?     

91
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,621
          Oh, you were          
 a hell of a pitcher. I saw you 

92
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,307
                      strike out
                 Reggie Jackson.

93
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,941
                Made him look   
                like a fool.    

94
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,677
                 Oh, well...    
I can hardly                    
blame him                       

95
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,128
                for knocking you
                 off the mound  

96
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,130
        the next time up with   
                that line drive.

97
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:39,050
    So, uh, Frasier told me     
        that you've, uh,        

98
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,685
        been baching it         
    a long time here.           

99
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,453
 It must be pretty rough, huh?  

100
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,456
Say, why didn't you just        
bring Valerie with you?         

101
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:46,157
                 Well, you know,
            she hates to travel.

102
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,093
             Besides, we decided
             this was a perfect 

103
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,628
             opportunity to test
                     my theories

104
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,129
         about marital fidelity.

105
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,332
    And I'm glad to say after   
        ten months of celibacy, 

106
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:57,201
             I can now pronounce
             my principle sound.

107
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,870
                ( <i>Sam whistles</i> )

108
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,238
 After ten months of celibacy,  

109
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:01,940
        I couldn't              
    even pronounce my name.     

110
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:08,262
    I make it a point to tell my
     wife at least once a day,  

111
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,266
        "You're my world, you're
         my life, I love you."  

112
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,418
          I'll bet my wife would
    love to hear those words.   

113
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:17,055
                  Could you give
                her a call?     

114
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,843
So the book's doing             
pretty good, huh?               

115
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,228
            Yeah, it has been   
        received rather well.   

116
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,864
      In fact, this last review 
      is so embarrassingly good,

117
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,032
         I should just wad it up
              and throw it away.

118
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,601
              But I need several
        hundred copies first.   

119
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,005
            Is there a photocopy
            machine around here?

120
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,306
        Yeah, Rebecca's         
     got one in her office.     

121
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,374
You don't mind,                 
do you?                         

122
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,375
    No, help yourself.          

123
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,676
    That's very kind of you.    

124
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:39,677
Any special instructions?       

125
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,413
                 Yes, just push 
                the blue button.

126
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,548
It's right under the sign       
that says, "This machine        

127
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,584
 is for photocopying documents, 
        not your butt."         

128
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:56,076
All set?                        

129
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:57,011
         Thanks again.          

130
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:57,879
        You're welcome.         

131
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,534
Miss Howe, may I ask            
you something?                  

132
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,901
             Sure.              

133
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:06,337
        I hope you won't        
    take this the wrong way,    

134
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,340
          but my field          
is human sexual dynamics.       

135
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,660
    And just now I had          
the strangest impression--      

136
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:14,595
 please, tell me if I'm wrong-- 

137
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:16,764
    that something happened     

138
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,266
when you and I were introduced. 

139
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,034
      I sensed some spark,      

140
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:23,204
          some flicker          
of response on your part.       

141
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,339
          Very subtle,          

142
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,891
but unmistakable.               

143
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,076
     Was I imagining that?      

144
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,647
          I think so.           

145
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,332
    Well, my mistake.           

146
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,518
    I'm sure you understand.    

147
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:38,620
                     Of course. 

148
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,223
     You-You-You are aware      
I wasn't being judgmental?      

149
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,407
        Of course.              

150
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,576
    It's the response itself    
      that interested me.       

151
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,944
     Purely as a scientist.     

152
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,162
And you                         
are quite sure                  

153
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,764
 that on some very basic level, 

154
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,902
     you didn't experience      
an undeniable attraction?       

155
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,604
        Positive.               

156
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,307
         Well, I'm glad         
      we cleared that up.       

157
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,347
Still, I can't keep             
from wondering...               

158
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,733
  ...whether your subconscious  

159
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,952
    may not be trying           
     to tell us something.      

160
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:11,869
        I swear to you,         
        Dr. Crandell...         

161
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:13,004
I mean,                         
when I hear                     

162
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,388
      such facile denial,       

163
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,674
  it always sets off a little   
    alarm in my head.           

164
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:17,942
         Dr. Crandell.          

165
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,526
    Call me Lawrence.           

166
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,279
        Let me make this        
    as clear as I know how.     

167
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:26,183
    There was no attraction     
    when we met, or since.      

168
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,368
                 I felt nothing.

169
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,687
                 I feel nothing.

170
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:33,124
        Zero, <i>nada,</i> zip.        

171
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,193
              Zip.              

172
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,030
    Interesting unconscious     
        choice of word.         

173
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,403
      Try this word: out.       

174
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,138
    All right, sorry.           

175
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:49,808
              Man.              

176
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,944
          ( <i>knocking</i> )          

177
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:53,795
        I give up.              

178
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,813
 You make me crazy with desire. 

179
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,815
 I can't keep my hands off you! 

180
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,484
    What do you want?!          

181
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:06,524
      Sign these invoices,      
      and then be gentle.       

182
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,302
         Why don't you          
    sit over there, Walter?     

183
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,473
You suppose I might trouble you 
for two brandies, Miss Howe?    

184
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,175
              Ask the bartender.

185
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,678
Of course we can help you.      

186
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,880
  Woody, uh, pour Dr. Crandell  
  a couple of our house brand.  

187
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,883
Two house brands                

188
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,017
                on the house.   

189
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,319
That's very kind                
of you, Sam.                    

190
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:39,256
One seldom gets to sample       
    a good Nigerian Cognac.     

191
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,312
Weren't you kind of             
rude to Dr. Crandell?           

192
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,747
         Was I? Sorry.          

193
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:48,515
Well, what'd he ever do to you? 

194
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,285
                I don't know.   
            Nothing. Never mind.

195
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,887
                  Your hostility
            was unmistakable.   

196
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:56,257
                ( <i>sighs</i> )       

197
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,209
                All right.      

198
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,445
        The man came on to me   
                in my office.   

199
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,382
                    Dr. Crandell
                 came on to you?

200
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,849
    What'd he do?               

201
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,251
    Did he touch you?           

202
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,686
        No, he did not touch me.

203
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,055
Make an indecent proposal?      

204
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,123
                  Of course not.

205
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,224
Comment on your looks,          

206
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,260
ask you for a date,             
whistle, flash, what?           

207
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:21,198
                        He asked
              about my feelings.

208
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,801
The man should                  
be horse whipped!               

209
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,206
        Rebecca, of course he   
      asked about your feelings.

210
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,541
                         I mean,
                 it's his field.

211
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,009
                         The man
                  is an analyst.

212
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,145
        He's written volumes on 
        human sexual attraction.

213
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,247
Wait, wait, so, uh,             
then what happened?             

214
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,916
    I'll tell you what happened,
             Mr. Smarty Pantses.

215
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:45,823
                He... thanked me
        politely and he left.   

216
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,261
        Oh, that doesn't seem   
        so terrible, does it?   

217
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,462
     Rebecca, I assure you,     

218
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:52,930
         you must have          
 misunderstood his intentions.  

219
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:54,531
            I mean,             
  he's in love with his wife.   

220
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,567
    They're the most happily    
     married couple I know.     

221
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,902
        Gee, I guess I could    
        have been wrong.        

222
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,638
      What if he was just being 
     psychological or something?

223
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,408
              I should apologize
                    to him, huh?

224
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,343
      I guess you should.       

225
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,245
    We'll be in touch.          

226
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:11,649
Dr. Crandell, may I speak       
    with you a moment?          

227
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,684
        Of course.              

228
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:17,322
Oh, I want to apologize         
to you for having               

229
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,558
that conversation and then me   
getting a little bit upset.     

230
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,459
I hope you don't think me rude. 

231
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:23,494
              Oh, of course not.

232
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,262
                    You answered
        my questions honestly   

233
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,197
          in the spirit in which
                they were asked.

234
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,033
                    So that's   
                the end to that.

235
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,567
Oh, good. Thank you.            

236
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,802
            That's all right.   

237
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,071
          You meet someone, you 
          find him unattractive,

238
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,674
                 even repulsive,
                     it happens.

239
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,810
Well, I don't think             
you're repulsive.               

240
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,078
                 No, no, please.

241
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,547
        Don't think you have to 
        worry about my feelings.

242
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,650
I think you're                  
an attractive man.              

243
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:47,852
                 Really, that's 
                very flattering.

244
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:51,656
            As a matter of fact,

245
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:54,491
    I'm really quite awkward and
    uncomfortable around women. 

246
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,460
            As a matter of fact,
                the very idea

    Ordinarily I'd say yes,

but you see, I'm expecting      
    a colleague any minute.

00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,473
So you see,                     
it's really not convenient.     

347
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,475

    about something you said,

and clarify away.

an aspirin,

of my headache                  

358

you in peace.

00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,499
     I want you to leap out     

369
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,118
and catch him                   
in the act.                     

370
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:47,984
      And then we'll prove      

371
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,469
once and for all                

372
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:52,172
    that he is a lech           
      and I am not cuckoo.      

373
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,907
 One thing at a time, Rebecca.  

374
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:57,144
        CRANDELL:               
     Two aspirin coming up.     

375
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,615
     Two tablets, buffered.     

376
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:04,684
I hope they go down well.       

377
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:05,936
            Bye-bye.            

378
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,472
         Dr. Crandell,          

379
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:11,692
 it's not really why I'm here.  

380
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,626
        It's not?               

381
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,328
              No.               

382
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:18,799
                     Now, I know
            you came on to me   

383
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:21,101
          and you know          
    you came on to me.          

384
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:24,938
    But I'm not leaving here    
      until you admit it.       

385
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:29,042
     All right, I admit it,     
 I came on to you, good night.  

386
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,511
             Ah-ha.             

387
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,499
             Ah-ha?             

388
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,271
I didn't quite hear that.       

389
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,022
      Oh, for God's sake,       

390
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,240
good night.                     

391
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,644
    Um, please, if you could    
just say it a little bit louder 

392
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:47,945
      and a little clearer      

393
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,414
      so that I know that       
    there's no mistaking it.    

394
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,816
        All right,              
  if that will make you happy,  

395
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,852
    I came on to you,           
    I came on to you.           

396
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,654
    You know, I'm beginning     
         to regret it.          

397
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,122
             Ah-ha!             

398
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,123
     Good night, Miss Howe.     

399
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,959
          You... Sam!           

400
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:04,628
     Would you get the hell     
         out of there?          

401
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,430
              Sam?              

402
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,214
                      Whoa, boy.

403
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:11,001
             These luxury hotels
             have great closets.

404
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,475
Did you hear                    
what he just said?              

405
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,277
              Uh, no, I'm sorry,

406
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,679
         I sort of had something
                      in my ear.

407
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,621
    You had a woman in here!    

408
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:32,956
Uh, as long as we got that      
established,                    

409
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:33,790
if you need me again,           

410
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,292
I'll be back                    
by the shoe rack.               

411
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,960
    Sam!                        

412
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,062
Remember our mission?           

413
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,598
    Now listen to me.           

414
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,034
This proves that I am not crazy.

415
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:45,786
This proves that                
he is just a lech.              

416
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:46,887
         I can explain.         

417
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,856
          Miss Johnson          
is my executive secretary.      

418
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:52,243
We have a great deal            
of dictation together.          

419
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,811
    Now if you'll excuse us.    

420
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,313
You sent for a violinist?       

421
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,618
          A violinist           
     to do your dictation?      

422
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:04,454
                        Come on.
                Now at least,   

423
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,857
        for God's sakes,        
        have the decency        

424
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,726
         to come clean          
    and tell Sam the truth.     

425
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,429
                  Oh, all right.

426
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,031
     I admit it, it's true.     

427
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,367
  I've been a very lonely man.  

428
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,869
 I thought this trip would put  
  my convictions to the test,   

429
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,272
                  but I'm afraid
              I came up lacking.

430
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:26,259
    I'm sorry if I caused you   
            any pain, Miss Howe.

431
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,562
Well, at least                  
you finally admitted it.        

432
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,230
            Yes, I'm glad the   
                truth is out.   

433
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,165
                        At last,
                  no more lying.

434
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,934
                 No more deceit.

435
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,235
          ( <i>knocking )</i>

00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,538
WOMAN:                          
Lawrence?                       
Guess who?                      

437
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,658
                It's my wife!   
                        Hide!   

438
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,595
I'm not going                   
in a closet.                    

439
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:45,812
          Oh, come on.          

440
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,564
                You'll enjoy it.
        I'll show you around.   

441
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,868
    Please, please, you must.   

442
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:51,935
          My career is at stake.

443
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,303
              So is my marriage.

444
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,405
              I've been faithful
                to this woman   
                for 15 years.   

445
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,007
                  Mostly because
        she's the scariest bitch

446
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,375
          you ever want to meet.

447
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,796
          ( <i>knocking</i> )          
    Lawrence, you all right?    

448
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:06,050
I am doing this                 
for your wife, buster.          

449
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,035
Uh, Rebecca, I want you         
to meet Maria.                  

450
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,336
                      Hi, Maria,
            nice to meet you.   

451
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,238
What's your name?               
Zol...                          
            Hi, I'm Rebecca.    

452
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,274
Lawrence?                       

453
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,309
      Yes, coming, coming.      

454
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:19,280
                    Oh, Valerie.
                Darling, what an
              enormous surprise!

455
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,315
What took you so long           
to answer the door?             

456
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:22,499
                 Well, it's this
                  plush carpet. 

457
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,834
         I caught my little toe.

458
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:25,802
        What brings you here?   

459
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,237
Well, when I spoke              
to you on the phone             

460
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,673
and I heard the hunger          
in that voice,                  

461
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,876
I couldn't bear to              
be separated from you           
one more minute.                

462
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,730
Champagne, Larry?               

463
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:38,999
          Oh, yes, they bring it
                 up every night.

464
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,535
          It's a fabulous hotel.

465
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:42,369
                    Let's go get
            something to eat.   

466
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,653
      You're not dressed.       

467
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,189
Well, we'll go                  
someplace casual.               

468
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:46,390
              Well, at least put
                      on a coat.

469
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,291
                  It's cool out.

470
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,759
I'll buy one on the way.        
Shall we?                       

471
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,929
                    Lawrence,   
                  put on a coat.

472
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,196
    Right.                      

473
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:55,365
Yes, anything                   
you say, dear. I'll just        

474
00:18:55,433 --> 00:19:00,403
  ( <i>loud, sing-songy voice</i> ):   
go to the closet all by myself. 

475
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:06,276
Get my coat all by myself.      

476
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,495
      I've never seen you       
         in that coat.          

477
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,064
    I just bought it.           

478
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:12,299
     If you don't like it,      
         back it goes.          

479
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,518
    No, Lawrence, put it on.    

480
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,719
         Put it on now.         

481
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,493
        Oh, that tailor.        

482
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:26,696
 Well, I'm stopping the payment 
         on that check!         

483
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:33,103
            Oh, I'm famished.   
                    Let's go.   

484
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,739
      Whoever is in that closet,
          come out this instant!

485
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,892
        All right,              
     I want an explanation,     

486
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,994
and I want it right this minute.

487
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,395
     Otherwise, I am going      
        to divorce him.         

488
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,113
                      I am going
              to take his money,

489
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:03,133
  and I am going to take his    
  reputation, and his career.   

490
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,736
And after that I am going       
    to do the same for each     

491
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,554
        and every one of you.   

492
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:11,425
  And believe me, I can do it.  

493
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:15,579
 So who is going to come forth  
      with an explanation?      

494
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:25,872
Um, we, uh, we're all here      
to change the lightbulbs.       

495
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,260
Mrs. Crandell,                  
I'm going to tell               
you the truth.                  

496
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:33,296
    because I feel that this    
     has gone on too long.      

497
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:35,699
And as usual, I have to be      

498
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,001
      the voice of reason.      

499
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,806
Forgive me for saying this,     

500
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,509
but if I were in your shoes,    
I would want to know.           

501
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:50,114
Your husband came on to me      
in a local bar.                 

502
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,884
          Do you mean           
     he propositioned you?      

503
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:58,922
Well, he didn't exactly         
proposition me.                 

504
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:02,091
 Well, what exactly did he do?  

505
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,028
He asked me                     
about my feelings.              

506
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,632
  That is his field, you know.  

507
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,970
That isn't all he did.          

508
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:16,873
He rubbed my leg                
with his disgusting foot.       

509
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,026
She never gets tired            
of telling this part.           

510
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:25,231
     Yes, yes, I admit it.      

511
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,035
I accidentally brushed up       
 against her leg with my foot.  

512
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:29,870
    I apologized profusely.     

513
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,574
  He did not have his shoe on.  

514
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,360
      It was hot in there.      

515
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,062
    Would you believe           
    the humiliation?            

516
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,965
A hole in my $50 hosiery.       

517
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,585
            Why you filthy...   

518
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:46,253
    Okay, fine, fine.           

519
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,589
          There is a chambermaid
                    in the room.

520
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:49,556
                     Explain it.

521
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,792
A chambermaid in a hotel?       

522
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,127
Will wonders never cease.       

523
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,613
You know, actually, we're going 
to be running along here.       

524
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,815
No, we're not going             
to be running along.            

525
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,183
        All right.              

526
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:05,255
How about the fiddler, huh?     

527
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:06,790
         I was lonely.          

528
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,359
  I was going to have him play  
      our song all night.       

529
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,128
        All right, all right.   

530
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:14,431
                    So have your
          loving husband explain

531
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,600
             why the four of us 
            were in that closet.

532
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,837
        You were there.         
    You mean you don't know?    

533
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,707
Yes, I know.                    

534
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:25,609
Because you are                 
the scariest bitch              

535
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:27,276
we would ever want to meet.     

536
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:33,016
                     And you are
                 a little tramp.

537
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,785
    Tramp?                      

538
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,370
Why,  I ought to put you...     

539
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:38,939
I'm going                       
to kill your husband!           

540
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:41,441
     I'm going to kill him!     
     I'm going to kill you!     

541
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,176
He's stupid, he's a fraud!      

542
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:44,544
         He's a psycho!         
        He's a...!              

543
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:47,681
I'm going to hunt you down      
    and kill you like a dog!    

544
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,935
 And why don't you get yourself 
    some new socks, buster?!    

545
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,905
SAM:                            
Um...                           

546
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,974
    Uh, I can explain           
    everything here.            

547
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,843
 She just wanted to convince me 
     that she's not crazy.      

548
