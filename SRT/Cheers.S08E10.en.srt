00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,421
Yeah, normie,      
             watch my wallet,   
             will you?

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:08,773
I got to go see a man          
 about a horse.

4
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:10,509
Will you look at this!

5
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:13,478
Pumpkin seeds are up to     
    9 cents a pound!

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,096
This world is goin' crazy.

7
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:16,281
Yeah, i know           
         what you mean, wood.

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,700
The dollar ain't worth     
     what it used to be, is it?

9
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:21,553
I don't understand.            
 How can a dollar               
 be worth less than a dollar?

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,004
[Sighing]      
                 well,

11
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:26,641
perhaps i can illustrate   
     using one of cliff's bills 
     here.

12
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,742
Ah!

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,312
Think of this, woody,   
        as the 1975 dollar, ok?

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,883
Probably been in that wallet   
 since 1975.

15
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,853
Now, taking account of 
         inflation, ok,

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,721
the high cost of living,

17
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,106
increased dollars      
         in circulation,

18
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:45,193
increased buying power 
         of that pesky yen,

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,161
and all you have left is,

20
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:49,564
a little bit of                
 george washington's left eye.

21
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,633
Well, wait a minute, now.

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,969
Would the same thing       
     apply to, oh,

23
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,589
say, $20?

24
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,959
Ah, macroeconomics.

25
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,295
Uh, yeah. Perhaps, uh,     
     we'll just try it and see,

26
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:04,463
the same principles.

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,098
Ok.

28
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,799
Inflation.                 
                 Uh-huh.

29
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,934
Cost of living.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,831
i just don't get               
 this inflation stuff.

38
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,199
[Sighing]          
             all right, woody,

39
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:01,552
once again, think of this beer 
 as the 1975 dollar, ok?

40
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,175
Now, it's a 1980 dollar.

41
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:11,112
Fill it up, i'll take you  
     right through              
     the reagan years.

42
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,366
All right, you might as well   
 forget it, mr. Peterson.

43
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,168
I'm just not gettin' it.

44
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:20,338
Woody, i'm willing to sit here 
 all night, if that's what      
 it takes, buddy.

45
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,224
Sorry i'm late.

46
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,193
I just got back         
        from my stylist.

47
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,495
Oh, gee, sam, your hair        
 doesn't look any different.

48
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:30,665
Uh, no. This was, uh-- 
         this was just          
         for an estimate.

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,851
I'm thinking of doin'   
        a body wave,

50
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,854
and my insurance company   
     wants me to go to          
     3 different places.

51
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:41,142
Sam, you--                     
 you have hair insurance?

52
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,810
Yeah. What, i'm gonna just

53
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,646
walk around                
     with fire and theft?

54
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,772
Got to get some more           
 pretzels for the bar.

55
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,524
Well, i don't know         
     if my phone is working     
     right or not.

56
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:57,842
Have i had any calls?

57
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:58,993
Yeah, robin called.

58
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,227
He did?

59
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,748
Yeah, about 3 weeks ago.   
     Don't you remember?

60
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,050
Carla, do you think        
     robin's losing interest    
     in me?

61
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,235
No, but i am.

62
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:08,737
Wait.

63
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,239
Come here. Please, sit down.   
 This is important.

64
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,308
Now look, i know               
 my relationship with robin     
 got off to a flying start.

65
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,744
But recently,

66
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:18,246
i think that maybe             
 he's finding me boring.

67
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:19,997
Now how could that be?

68
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,683
You're dull.

69
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,870
I'm only dull on the outside.

70
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:29,207
On the inside, i'm a seething  
 cauldron of fun.

71
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,476
All i have to do is find--

72
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,812
find something                 
 that will make robin sit up    
 and take notice of me.

73
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,082
Something that will make him   
 realize what a special person  
 i really am.

74
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,417
Have you gone to bed       
     with him yet?

75
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:40,619
No.

76
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,704
Well, that's always been   
     a good icebreaker for me.

77
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,622
Wait. Wait.

78
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,357
Now look, i did not        
     go to bed with robin       
     on the first date

79
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:47,958
because i was out of practice.

80
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:50,495
And i thought i'd be rotten,   
 and then he would dump me.

81
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,396
And on the 2nd date,           
 i didn't go to bed with him

82
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:53,665
because i thought          
     he respected me

83
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,700
for not going to bed with him  
 on the first date.

84
00:03:55,768 --> 00:04:01,239
And then by the 3rd date,      
 it was already an old habit.

85
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:04,325
All right, now i'm going out   
 with him my 4th time,          
 and frankly,

86
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,160
i'm hot-to-trot.

87
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,413
So?

88
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,065
So, he's coming in town    
     tonight,

89
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,833
i haven't seen him         
     for a month,               
     and i don't know--

90
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,668
you know, i really need    
     some help here.

91
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,937
Now, you've got a reputation   
 of being uninhibited,

92
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,357
low-down, dirty, perverted.

93
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:22,610
You should have known me   
     when i was a real slut.

94
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,163
Let me ask you              
    a question now.

95
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,050
What is the wildest thing      
 you ever did

96
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:31,352
to really get           
        a guy's attention?

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,503
Well.

98
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,171
Now, let me see.

99
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,045
There was the time         
     i was makin' love to a guy 
     on a carousel.

100
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:42,663
Where?                     
     An amusement park?

101
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,532
No, laguardia airport.

102
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,604
Want to give it a try?      
        Well, i don't know.

103
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:51,823
What, are you gettin'          
 dull on me again?

104
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,111
Well, you know,                
 i've just been so darn dull,   
 for so darn long.

105
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,296
Wait a minute.             
     Whoa! What do you think    
     about this?

106
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,381
You're going               
     to like this one.

107
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,049
He comes in tonight,

108
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:03,951
i sneak into his apartment,

109
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,087
i put on               
         some nice soft music,

110
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:07,955
i chill some champagne,

111
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,024
he walks through the door,

112
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,759
and i greet him.

113
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:16,247
Whoa, what an idea.

114
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,032
Way to go, rebecca!

115
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,166
Thank you.

116
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,335
 Dull-de-dull, dull,  
         dull 

117
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,627
economics                      
 is so complicated.

118
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,663
Woody, i could 
                 sit here

119
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,532
and try to discuss          
    the principles of economics 
    with you

120
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,067
till i'm blue           
        in the face.

121
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,970
But i've always found      
     that nothing

122
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,973
will explain           
         the process quicker

123
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,841
than a simple game     
         of monopoly.

124
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,460
Anyone care to join me?

125
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,961
Monopoly, eh?   
                         (Norm) 
                         yeah!

126
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,929
I don't know, uh...

127
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,498
well, lilith's at home 
         with the baby,

128
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,233
they both seem rather  
         tired and cranky,

129
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,201
so i really ought to   
         get home by, uh,

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,770
umm, thursday.

131
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,040
All right,                     
 i'm the banker.

132
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,642
No, no, no, i'm trying 
         to explain this        
         to you, woody.

133
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,243
I have to be the banker,   
     all right?

134
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,511
I'm always the banker.

135
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,029
No, no, i'm always     
         the banker, ok?

136
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,431
Look here,                 
     if i can't be the banker,

137
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,215
i just won't play.     
         How's that?

138
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:10,017
Well, maybe i'll just go get   
 my own monopoly board

139
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,787
and play                
        with my real friends.

140
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:14,088
Now let's not           
        be childish.

141
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,056
If woody wants to           
    be the banker,

00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,188
That would have been       
     romantic.

283
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,589
What's he gonna do

284
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:15,392
when he comes back here     
    and he sees                 
    the two of us together?

285
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,094
Boy, honey, it's--

286
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,263
it's one of those       
        complicated situations.

287
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,899
I think what we oughtta do is, 
 go back into the bedroom,

288
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,086
take our clothes off,   
        and make hot,           
        passionate love.

289
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,804
That is not going to help.

290
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,639
It's not gonna hurt.

291
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,076
All right, fine.

292
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,412
I'll call the police.   
        They'll get us out.

293
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,814
We happen to be in         
     the apartment, illegally,

294
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:40,117
of one of the richest men      
 in the world.

295
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,585
Well, so he'll vouch for us.

296
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:42,853
[Scoffs]           
             yes.

297
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:45,056
He may vouch for me    
         after he dumps me,

298
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,758
laughs at me,      
             and never wants    
             to see me again.

299
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,860
You, he will leave     
         rotting in jail,

300
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,929
where you and              
     your pretty boy features

301
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:54,999
will be traded nightly  
        for a pack of menthols.

302
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,122
Well, uh, i hate to see you    
 get dumped.

303
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:07,077
There's just got to be     
     something around here      
     that either has a key,

304
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:09,813
or a--a combination    
         or-- oh, here it is.

305
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:10,698
Oh god,                
         here it is. Jackpot.

What do you got?       
         What do you got?

307
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,851
It's the alarm system manual.

308
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,285
Find out how to turn   
         the thing off.

00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:16,921

    What kind of system         
    are we talkin' about here?

    i just realized somethin'.

 any money in the bank,         
 you put it with your own.

383
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,990
I don't believe it.

384
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,893
I have sat here        
         for the last 5 hours   
         watching each of you

    his way to a small fortune,

             of uncle wiggly.

             whatsoever!

390
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:42,059
And what was               
     the purpose of this game,  
     after all? I mean...

391
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:45,613
i was just tryin'          
     to teach woody             
     the nature of economics.

392
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,515
Oh, well, then, bravo.

393
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,439
What am i gonna do, sam?

394
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,907
I have blown this.

395
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,894
I have blown                
    the entire relationship.

00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:01,878
Come on. Take it easy.

         until morning.

398

Yeah, yeah.

399
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,185
That just gives me more time   
 to think about it.

400
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,088
How humiliated i'm gonna be 
    when robin walks through    
    that door

401
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,290
and finds me in here    
        without permission,

lying on the floor     
         with a bartender

403
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,094
underneath a grid      
         of laser beams.

404
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,862
Oh, calm down.

405
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,647
Enjoy the light show.

You know what you do        
    to take your mind off,

407
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,387
is why don't               
     i crawl over there         
     and we could just talk?

408
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,993
You can crawl over here        
 if nothing on your body        
 touches anything on my body.

409
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,363
There is one good thing        
 about this whole deal.

410
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,549
Seeing you crawl               
 on your belly like a worm.

411
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:43,687
I'm secure enough           
    of my masculinity to accept 
    that as a compliment.

00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,894
this was going to be    
        the most fabulous night 
        of my entire life.

414
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:53,163
Oh, come on,           
         it's not that bad.

415
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:55,332
I'm kind of enjoying myself.

416
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,033
I can't remember       
         the last time that

417
00:18:57,101 --> 00:19:00,237
i laid awake at night,     
     just talking to somebody.

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,773
a kid

420
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,142
sharing a bunk bed     
         with my brother.

421
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,744
[Rasping]

422
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,648
you're trying to tell me that  
 with all those                 
 thousands of women

423
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:14,218
you supposedly slept with,     
 you never stayed up            
 and talked to one of 'em?

424
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,086
What's to talk about?

425
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,457
I mean, a guy does          
    all his talking beforehand.

426
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:23,594
[Chuckles]

427
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:27,147
so, like, what did     
         you and your brother   
         talk about?

428
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,649
Oh, you know,

429
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:32,586
usual things.          
         Comic books, movies,   
         records,

430
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:37,791
all the babes              
     we were gonna score with   
     once we got our own room.

431
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,693
Did you ever share a room  
     with your sister?

432
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,194
Oh, yeah.

433
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,296
But i'll tell you           
    one thing,

434
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:43,697
we didn't talk about           
 stupid stuff

435
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,265
like you and your brother      
 talked about.

436
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,850
All right,                 
     what did you talk about?

437
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,018
Dreams,

438
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,653
aspirations,

439
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,021
the meaning of life.

440
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:52,405
In other words, boys.

441
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,675
You betcha.

442
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:57,644
And then                   
     we'd do each other's hair  
     all different ways and,

443
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,181
and then we'd dream about  
     owning a ranch             
     and a bunch of horses.

444
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,766
Wh-what is it with horses?

445
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,202
Why do girls               
     get all goopy over horses?

446
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:09,823
Oh, yeah, and like guys        
 are real rational about cars?

447
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:13,360
Hey, listen, you take a--  
     you take                   
     a '57 chevy ragtop

448
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:16,363
and you park it         
        right next to some dumb 
        spotted horse,

449
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,616
now, you tell me       
         which one              
         you wanna make out in?

450
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,689
That's a good point.

451
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:29,726
You know what?              
    It's sort of interesting.

452
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:33,180
Here you and i are,

453
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:36,767
you know, talking              
 to each other like this,       
 intimately and,

454
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,953
and i mean, i--i mean,     
     i can see that             
     we have our differences.

455
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,555
But basically,

456
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:44,191
you know, besides the fact 
     that you're a man          
     and i'm a woman,

457
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,726
i--i don't think        
        we're that different.

458
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,061
What do you think?

459
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:49,346
[Snoring]

460
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,217
[huffs]

461
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,520
and i do like you better       
 like this.

462
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,325
Man,

463
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,261
not one split end.

464
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,598
What is this guy's secret?

465
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,655
Good night, sam.

466
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:26,950
[Beeping]

467
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,724
someone's coming.           
    Hide.

468
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,392
Huh? Well, who is it,  
         your husband?

469
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:38,128
No, sam, wake up.          
     Somebody's coming.         
     We have to hide.

470
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,930
[Elevator bell dings]      
                 what? Oh.

471
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,715
Here, here, here,      
         here, here.

472
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,475
Ok, let's get out of here      
 before she sees us.

473
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,676
Jeez!

474
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,349
No, no, no!                
                     Oh, right.

475
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,771
You look kind of sexy          
 when you first wake up.

476
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,524
Oh, thanks, sam.

477
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,927
Sam, you're not gonna      
     tell the guys at the bar

478
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,896
some wild tales        
         about what happened    
         last night, are you?

479
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,448
Oh, no, no.                 
    I'm gonna tell them         
    the absolute truth.

480
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:17,517
Walked in here, found you      
 buck-naked,

481
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,186
spent the night                
 on the floor with you

482
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,072
surrounded                     
 by colored lights.

483
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,841
All right.         
             At least tell them 
             i was good.

484
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:30,079
I think i could sell that.

485
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,832
You know, sam,             
     i--i do have to say that   
     i'm very proud of you.

486
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,002
Why?                   
     Because we spent           
     the whole night together,

487
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,753
and you didn't     
             lay a hand on me.

488
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,605
I want to thank you 
            for that.

489
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,807
I want to thank you    
         for being a gentleman.

490
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,842
Oh, you're welcome.

491
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,111
Uh, i want to thank you.

492
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:46,146
For what?              
    For being                   
    such a sound sleeper.

493
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:47,881
You're welcome. 
                Hey!
