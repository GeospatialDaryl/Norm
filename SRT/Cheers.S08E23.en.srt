Yeah, i'm sorry, sam.          
 All right,                     
 i'll tell miss howe.

00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,358
What's the matter with sammy?

4
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,793
Oh, he's not feelin' well.     
 He ain't gonna be in today.

5
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:15,396
Oh, a girl.

6
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:17,899
He probably won't be in        
 tomorrow, either.

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,584
2 girls.

8
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:23,088
He might not be in             
 the whole week.

9
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,057
The laker girls.

10
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:28,726
No, it's serious.

11
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,378
He thinks                      
 he might have chicken pox.

12
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,863
Chicken pox.

13
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,466
That's pretty painful       
    for an adult,               
    and highly contagious, too.

14
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,318
Ok, ladies,            
         now, remember,

 No, i'm not the kind of girl

 to some guy and say, "hi."

57
00:02:57,042 --> 00:03:00,445
Why, carla,                    
 what a refreshing thing        
 to hear from someone like you.

58
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,380
Well, why bother sayin' hi

59
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,667

         on your thigh?

60

     when i was in college?

62
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:17,161
Oh, darryl!                
     You remembered me.

63
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,730

64
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,632
You know,              
         i saw you last night.

You were sensational.

66
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:24,185
We didn't play a game          
 last night.

Well, you sure scored.

68
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:29,991
So, carla,                     
 are you still married?

69
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,926
No, i'm a widow now.

70
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:34,245
My husband passed away 
         several months ago.

71
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:36,214
Oh, gee, carla,                
 i'm so sorry.                  
                    Yeah.

72
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,682
I remember seein' eddie        
 play hockey.

73
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,116
He was the quickest            
 goalie on the ice.

74
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,585
I'm really sorry               
 about your loss.

75
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,203
Yeah, thanks.

76
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,273
It's been a few months,        
 but i'm still wearin' black.

77
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:46,725
No, you're not.

78
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,759
Darryl, trust me.

79
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,312
Beer?      
        Yeah.

80
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,747
All right.

81
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:54,449
Hey.                
 Yeah, look's like, uh,

82
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,851
cupid just shot his arrow      
 through carla's heart.

83
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,019
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:00,705
Hey, uh, when did carla 
        get a heart?

85
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,042
Well, kudos to carla.

86
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,711
It's healthy after a time  
     to curtail one's grieving

87
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,848
and recommence an interest 
     in the opposite sex.

88
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,050
I know if my frasier   
         were taken from me

89
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:13,251
in an unforeseen tragedy,

90
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,685
i would certainly  
             date again

91
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,322
after an acceptable period 
     of bereavement.

92
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,542
That gives me              
     a warm, fuzzy.

93
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,299
There'd be no sense in being   
 overly emotional, darling.

94
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,401
You'd be dead          
         and rotting in a box.

95
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,805
Woody, may i have      
         another beer, and, uh,

96
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:38,243
would you check on     
         the robot over there,  
         see if it's thirsty?

97
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,760
Hey, dr. Crane,                
 that's your wife.

98
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,796
Don't talk about her           
 like that.

99
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,414
What can i get you,        
     dr. Sternin-crane,

100
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,083

     stop it.

103
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,338
[In staccato]

106
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,544
I'm gonna be on television.

107
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,195
All right. What for?

108
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,014
Because i wrote a letter   
     to  <i>consumer patrol.</i>

109
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:03,317
Ho!  <i>Consumer patrol,</i>

110
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,003

         Don't you remember,

111
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,688
art stickler

     new electric blanket.

113
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,157

                No, no, no.

114
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:13,261

    when she found him under it 
    with his secretary.

They've been off the air

searching for a new host.

117
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,817
Whereas lilith would have      
 found one the next day.

118
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,356
So, what were you              
 complainin' about, miss howe?

119
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,258
Thank you for asking, woody.

120
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,910
Last month i purchased  
        a lady baldy.

121
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,129
A what?

122
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,030
It's this electronic   
         device for women,

123
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,700
and it's used to pull       
    leg hairs out by the roots.

124
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,136
I'm telling you, this monster  
 chewed my legs to bits.

125
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,154
Oh.

126
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:42,173
You know, and  <i>consumer patrol</i> 
<i> has had a lot of reports</i>

127

about the exact same thing,

128
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,976
but they chose me              
 to appear on television.

129
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,912
You must have written   
        a very eloquent letter.

130
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,213
Yes, i think i did.

131
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,915
Also, i took a piece           
 of stationery

132
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,917
and smacked it against         
 my bloody, mangled legs

133
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,585
and sent them that, too.

134
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,155

 believe this.

135

00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,193

     just asked me out again.   
     All right!

137

You and darryl mead.           
 That is h-o-t.

I know!

139
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,233
Boy, you know,     
             this feels weird.

140
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,668
What?

141
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:13,571
My first date          
         since eddie's death.

142
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:18,710
Carla, it's perfectly natural  
 to be reticent about           
 reentering the dating scene,

143
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,311
but you've--you've 
             mourned

144
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,246
a respectful amount 
            of time.

145
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,748
You know,              
         i know of some women

146
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,583
who would shimmy right out 
     of their black dress

147
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,318
and start flirting 
             with the embalmer.

148
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:31,188
And, now,

149
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,792
i think it's time for you  
     to take those first

150
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:36,928
tentative steps                
 back into social interaction,

151
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,363
and, dare i say it, uh,

152
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,499
romance.

153
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,333
You know, frase,           
     you're right.

154
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,687
Eddie's gone,          
         and i'm here.

155
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,506
Come on, darryl,       
         let's barrel.

156
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,141
Great. Let me just             
 settle up.

157
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,460
All right.      
                I'll get a cab.

158
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,830
[Shrieking]

159
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,567
carla, what is it?

160
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:03,020
Nothing.

161
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,827
Guess it was just the wind.

162
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,003
All right, lilith,

163
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,705
let's just have out with it,   
 once and for all.

164
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,273
Should i pass on,

165
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,510
just who is it you'd be 
        smacking your lips at   
        over my open casket?

166
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,978
For god's sake, frasier,       
 all right.

167
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,981
If you were to die,            
 i would weep for days on end,

168
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,083
wear black                     
 till the end of my life,

169
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,853
and never, ever, ever          
 let another man touch me

170
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,422
as long as i live.

171
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:40,958
This i would do in loving      
 remembrance of you. Ok?

172
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,695
Now, was that so hard?

173
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:48,833
Hey, you guys,

174
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,367
what do you think?

175
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,454
Is this dress all right    
     for  <i>consumer patrol?</i>

176
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,105
Why wouldn't it be?

177
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,557
Well, i'm just afraid that

178
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,426
the audience might be          
 so distracted by my dress

179
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,227
that they won't listen         
 to what i have to say.

180
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,330
No, that's ridiculous. 
         Just state your case.

181
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,864
All these people   
             care about is

182
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,800
the grievous, bodily damage

183
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:09,036
that this product has          
 inflicted on your sensitive...

184
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,872
firm...

185
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,758
milky white flesh.

186
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,068
I just hope i'm prepared.

187
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,871
I don't want this guy          
 to throw me any curve balls.

188
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,323
Well, you want me to ask you   
 some practice questions?

189
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,909
Oh, sure.                      
 If you don't mind.

190
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,494
No. No problem. 
                Let's see, uh,

191
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,029
ok, i got it.

192
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,064
Now, when you purchased 
        the lady baldy,

193
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:40,868
you knew full well that it     
 pulls hairs out by the root,   
 correct?

194
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:41,986
Yes, i did.

195
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,587
Then, wouldn't you          
    have to be a complete idiot

196
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,557
not to expect some irritation  
 or discomfort?

197
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,046
Come on,            
            what's your answer?

198
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,731
We're on television,   
         thousands of people    
         are watching.

199
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,433
Ok, ok, well, i guess--        
             oh, you guess?

200
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,685
Great, great, you guess!   
     Hey, this is a news show.

201
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,086
We're here for the facts.

202
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,488
All right,                     
 so the facts are--

203
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:02,523
[imitates buzzer sounding]  
    too late.                   
    They've gone to commercial.

204
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:03,791
You're what was.

205
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,665
Woody,

206
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:13,033
that was a mean,       
         vicious streak.

207
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,503
I've never seen        
         that side of you.

208
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,254
Where does that come from?

209
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:20,574
Well, our theater's doin'      
 a production of  <i>12 angry men.</i>

210
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,228
Yeah?

211
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,430
Yeah, we've only got 6,

212
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:28,633
so we have to be,              
 like, twice as furious.

213
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,806
Hi, guys.

214
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,610
Oh, back so soon from your     
 date with darryl mead?

215
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,279
Yeah. I left darryl    
         at the restaurant.

216
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,781
Feelin' kind of funny.

217
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:47,118
Uh-oh.                         
 You're not comin' down         
 with somethin', are you?

218
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,320
Are you comin' down            
 with sam's chicken pox?

219
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,708
No. I just keep seein'     
     my dead husband, eddie,    
     everywhere.

220
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,693
Is he covered with spots?

221
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,498
Carla, when you say    
         you keep seeing eddie,

222
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,283
wha-- just what do you mean?

223
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,185
Just what i said.

224
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:05,953
I was havin' dinner            
 with darryl.

225
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,922
All of a sudden, i look down,

226
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:11,375
and i start seein'             
 eddie's face everywhere.

227
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,410
It was so strange.

228
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,079
I looked at my steak,

229
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,148
i see eddie's face.

230
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,400
I look at my broccoli,     
     i see eddie's face.

231
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,469
Well, we've all seen that. 
     I mean,

232
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:25,406
let's face it.              
    Eddie looked like broccoli.

233
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:27,691
What a terrible                
 experience, carla.

234
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,594
Um, what do you suppose

235
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,429
triggered this                 
 bizarre apparition?

236
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,397
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

237
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:37,468
Eddie's spirit does not        
 want me to be on that date.

238
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,470
He's come back                 
 from beyond the grave

239
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,505
to tell me not to go out       
 with darryl mead.

240
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,141
Oh, carla, you can't   
         be serious. I mean,

241
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,443
ghouls do not rise         
     from their resting place

242
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,461
just to ruin       
             your dating life.

243
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:48,813
Well, vera did.

244
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,834
Now, why wouldn't eddie        
 want you to go out             
 with darryl?

245
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,637
I don't know,       
            but there must be   
            a good reason.

246
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:59,506
Anyway,                    
     i get the message, eddie.

247
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,775
You hear that?

248
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:03,210
I'm not goin' out  
             with darryl mead.

249
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,511
Ok?

250
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,464
Thanks for the warning.

251
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,549
Feel free                      
 to rest in peace now.

252
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,368
[Laughs]

253
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:15,489
well. Glad that's over with.

254
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:16,991
[Sighing]

255
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:19,410
so what'll it be?

256
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,078
[Shrieking]

257
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:23,547
[gasping]

258
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,652
[exclaiming]

259
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,887
[shrieking]

260
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:40,948
[glasses tinkling]         
         no! No!

261
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,516
Carla, it's all right.         
     He's over there!

262
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:44,551
He's over there!            
    He's over there!            
            Now, listen, carla.

263
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,353
Carla?                 
         Carla, listen to me.

264
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:47,588
No!                 
             Listen to me.

265
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,490
Open your eyes     
             and look around.

266
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:55,395
Now, you see?   
                Nobody's there.

267
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,950
Oh, the dead!

268
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,336
Oh, no, carla, carla,  
         that's lilith!

269
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,979
Granted, she could use 
         a little sun.

270
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,618
Now, carla.

271
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:18,986
Ca-carla,

272
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:21,021
um, here, carla,

273
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,860
i'm sorry.

274
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:29,230
I'm sorry, carla.              
 I--i should have warned you.

275
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,697
How's the toe, 
                 dr. Crane?

276
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,066
Oh, not so good, woody.        
 Thanks.

277
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,871
I should have warned you   
     about the--

278
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,473
the tricks the mind        
     can play on one

279
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,475
during periods             
     of emotional transition.

280
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,377
Oh, it wasn't a trick,         
 frasier. I saw him.

281
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:45,062
I saw eddie. He was--

282
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,329
he was everywhere.

283
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,465
I mean, this bar was lousy     
 with eddies.

284
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,767
(All)              
             ooh!

285
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,004
He's got somethin'     
         to tell me.

286
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,907
And, it's more than just me    
 going out with darryl.

287
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,409
I mean, he's got a message     
 from beyond the grave,

288
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:01,012
and he's not gonna rest        
 until he tells me what it is.

289
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,947
Carla, listen to me.

290
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,233
I think it's important         
 that you talk with someone.

291
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:07,802
Oh, yes.

292
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,637
Frasier, i gotta talk  
         to somebody.

293
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,272
I'd be glad to give you        
 a list of reputable doctors,

294
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,642
who'd be willing to give you   
 treatment on a sliding scale.

295
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,511
The important thing            
 is seeking the aid

296
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:17,978
of a competent professional.

297
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,246
Right.

298
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,982
Hello, madame lazora?

299
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,152
This is carla lebec.

300
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,820
I want to make     
             an appointment

301
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:29,673
to speak with the dead.

302
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,193
Speak with the dead?   
         You can't be serious.

303
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,496
I got to find out what     
     eddie's tryin' to tell me.

304
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:37,531
Oh, great.

305
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,765
Thank you.

306
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,334
Ok, i'll see you then.

307
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,238
Boy, she's good.

308
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:46,256
She knew               
         i was gonna call.

309
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:49,609
Carla,                 
         this psychic business

310
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,662
i-i-it's just a crutch     
     to avoid reality.

311
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,363
I mean, it's very easy         
 for people to get hooked

312
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,249
on this hocus-pocus,           
 and it--

313
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:57,818
well, before you know it,  
     this woman will be holding 
     your hand once a week,

314
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,253
charging you   
                 $100 an hour,

315
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,922
and filling your mind with     
 all sorts of confusing jargon.

316
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,308
And how is that            
     different from you?

317
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:09,730
Well, um...

318
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,933
i can prescribe drugs.

He's being way too easy 
        on her.

326
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,740
I'd have had her   
             in tears by now.

what do we have to 
             look forward to

356
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,578
when madame lazora arrives 
     this evening?

357
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,015
A group of us              
     holding hands in a circle  
     around 13 black candles

358
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,651
while the ghost of houdini 
     leads us in                
     a rousing rendition

00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,186

Frasier, if i might say so,

361
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,860
a good scientist               
 does not close his mind        
 to alternatives,

362
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:23,296
especially when it comes       
 to the welfare of a patient.

363
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,332
Oh, that's very        
         open-minded, lilith.

364
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,235
This, from a woman     
         who has left and right 
         sock drawers.

365
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,690
A person can have              
 different-sized feet.

366
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,860
We've had this discussion.

367
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,464
Carla.

368
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,132
Oh, madame lazora.

369
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,484
It's so good of you        
     to come on short notice.

370
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,219
My pleasure.

371
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:49,056
So, this is your workplace.

372
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,758
It's just as you               
 described it.

373
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:53,493
The faces of the dead          
 linger here.

374
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,429
Whoa! Boy, oh, boy.

375
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:58,165
You mean you're in,            
 uh, contact with the spirits   
 already?

376
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,185
No, i was talking about        
 lard butts like yourself.

377
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,889
Have a seat. I'm getting   
     things ready over there.   
     Thank you.

378
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,107
Madame lazora,

379
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,892
i'm dr. Frasier crane,

380
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,310
scientist,

381
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,913
and, a rational        
         human being.

382
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,448
I feel it's my duty    
         to warn you

383
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,651
that i'm going to be    
        watching you, madame,   
        with a jaundiced eye,

384
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:20,671
ready to expose you         
    at the sign                 
    of the first floating head.

385
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,556
Oh, i'm shaking.

386
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,076
Young man,

387
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,878
if you are not careful,    
     you are about to lose

388
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,647
a sum of money         
         in the near future.

389
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,650
That is amazing.           
     How'd she know that?

390
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,136
Maybe it's the wallet  
         hanging out            
         of your back pocket.

391
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,255
Wow.

392
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,491
Coincidence?

393
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:42,108
I think not.

394
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:47,698
Uh, madame lazora,

395
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,099
let's get this show    
         on the road.

396
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,634
Everything's ready over here.

397
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,852
Uh, madame lazora,

398
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,788
i'm dr. Lilith sternin-crane.

399
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,890
Would you permit me            
 to observe quietly?

400
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:57,557
I'm fascinated                 
 with the notion

401
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,260
of parapsychological           
 phenomena.

402
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,861
Well,                      
     if carla has no objection.

403
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,529
You see, for my purposes,

404
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:03,981
the psychic flow is stronger,

405
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,083
it's more condensed    
         surrounded by people

406
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,752
who have                   
     potent spiritual energy.

407
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,971
Yeah, well, you don't have     
 to ask me twice.

408
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:14,491
No way.

409
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,493
No, no, no, carla, 
             it's fine.

410
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,995
He will attract            
     the negative energy away   
     from the rest of us

411
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,798
like a lightning rod.

412
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,700
Glad to do my part.

413
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,518
You.

414
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:28,722
You have a nice pink aura.

415
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,674
Well, i, uh, eat right.

416
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,210
Good. Sit.

417
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,598
Now,

418
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,350
could you kindly           
     dim the lights a little,   
     please?

419
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,339
Now,

420
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,608
i want you all         
         to concentrate

421
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,092
on the deceased,

422
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,247
and i will attempt      
        to summon his spirit    
        into our midst.

423
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,249
I'm scared.                    
 Norm, hold my hand.

424
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,651
All right. You got it.

425
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,003
Woods, hold my hand.

426
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:07,811
Um, lilith, could you   
        please pass me a straw?

427
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,426
We call upon the spirit 
        of the deceased,

428
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:26,630
guy edward lebec.

429
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,599
Sweet spirits, we await you.

430
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:31,368
Eddie,

431
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,637
speak to carla.

432
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,275
[Slurping]

433
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,648
sorry.

434
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,235
Eddie.

435
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:51,555
Eddie lebec.

436
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,861
Why isn't he answering,        
 madame lazora?

437
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,398
Better you should ask      
     the wind why it blows,     
     or it does not blow.

438
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,465
Ok.

439
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,285
Cliff,                         
 why isn't he answering?

440
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,220
Uh, well, if you'll excuse     
 me, madame lazora,

441
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,705
the ectoplasmic membrane--

442
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,540
wait, wait, wait.

443
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,776
I sense something.

444
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,962
I--i feel a presence.

445
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,815
[Glasses tinkling]         
         oh, my god! It's ed!

446
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:18,932
Eddie's returned.

447
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,134
[Jingling]

448
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,386
made you look,     
             made you look!

449
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:33,280
Frasier, don't be such         
 an insensitive clod.

450
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,749
Oh, come on!               
     This is ridiculous!

451
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:37,984
You know, there is a reason    
 why she can't contact him.

452
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:41,872
You've all overlooked       
    one important thing.        
    The man is dead, people!

453
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:45,025
Was i the only one         
     at the funeral, hmm?

454
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,110
I mean, this is a sham.

455
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,112
This woman is a fake,   
        a charlatan,

456
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,964
a mountebank.

457
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:54,617
How dare you criticize 
         my spiritualist?

458
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,303
Do you think it's easy         
 to communicate with the dead?

459
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,973
Has it ever occurred to you    
 that maybe it isn't her fault?

460
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,475
Maybe eddie                
     doesn't want to be raised.

461
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,444
Maybe he doesn't have  
         anything to say to me.

462
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:07,831
Maybe he hasn't been   
         spooking me at all.

463
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:10,417
How do you know        
         that the problem       
         isn't all in my head?

464
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:13,236
Did you ever think of that, 
    mr. Big-time shrink?

465
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,605
Maybe i'm just conjuring up 
    all these images of eddie

466
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:18,925
because i'm afraid to go out   
 on my first date in 3 years.

467
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,210
Eddie.

468
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,262
Eddie is here.

469
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,064
Eddie says,                
     "you are right, carla."

470
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,534
Oh.

471
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:29,703
It's a miracle.

472
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,737
You're a genius.

473
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,989
Oh, for the love of god.

474
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,407
You saw it.

475
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,826
You just choose            
     not to believe.

476
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,197
Why do i come in here?

477
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,416
Perhaps for a little free      
 seance action?

478
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:44,902
I'm spent.

479
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:49,622
Eddie has passed over.

480
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,392
The spirits have left us.  
     May they rest in peace.

481
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,194
The seance is over.

482
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,068
Well, thank you.

483
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:02,769
That was really somethin',     
 huh, cliffie?

484
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:04,037
Oh, yeah, i'll say.

485
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,840
Boy, i--i--i seen fire, 
        and i seen rain.

486
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,944
Cliff, everyone's seen         
 fire and rain.

487
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:14,147
Oh. Well, then, i guess        
 i got nothin' to say.

488
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:19,819
I tell ya,                 
     tonight really made        
     a believer out of me.

489
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,021
Really?

490
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,857
Yep. From now on,          
     it's beer through a straw.

491
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,179
Here's your check,             
 madame lazora.

492
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,814
It's worth                     
 every penny of it.

493
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,348
Thank you.     
     Thank you.

494
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,034
You see, doctor?

495
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:38,238
15 minutes, $250,      
         and that's take-home.

496
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:41,274
I don't pay taxes. 
             I'm not a citizen.

497
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:43,644
If you'll excuse me,   
         i'm off to my jaguar.

498
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,145
I left it on a loading zone.

499
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:47,463
I would hate to lose it.   
     I paid cash.

500
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,184
A jaguar.

501
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:53,687
She's gonna have problems.

502
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:59,026
Well, i gotta be goin'.

503
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm gonna try to               
 catch up with darryl.

504
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,963
Carla, i'm glad to see 
         you've made your peace 
         with the great beyond.

505
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,265
(Carla)             
            yeah.

506
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,000
Now i'm gonna go       
         grab a piece

507
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09,035
of the great behind.

508
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:12,372
Go with grace,     
             sweet spirit.
