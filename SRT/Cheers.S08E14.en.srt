You really know            
     that's true

7
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:18,116
when you come back             
 to a place you haven't seen    
 in 20 years.

Yeah, you see              
     those stairs?

13
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,280
They used to go down           
 the other side of that wall.

00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,815
Hmm.    
    Hmm.

50
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,480
That's very weird.         
     She wanted to know         
     why i stood her up.

51
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:46,730
You missed a date?

No, i didn't make one. 
         But she said

53
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,368
she spent the afternoon    
     waiting for me             
     at the roller rink

     something like that.

56

             on my deathbed.

     the lights,

69
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,237
and whoever took           
     my little black book

70
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,905
will just put it           
     right back on the bar.

Oh. All right.             
     Here it is                 
     on my right hand.

76
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,525
I took it off          
         my left hand

77
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:50,795
so it wouldn't get wet  
        when i was washing      
        the bar glasses.

78
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,715
Wood, don't you use     
        both hands when         
        you wash the glasses?

79
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,499
Well, that's ok.           
     It's waterproof.

that may be it will be         
 good publicity for the bar

118
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,097
if you could come up

124
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,847

00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:15,039
cheers.

135
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:16,908
Annie.

136
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,160
As in annietime        
         he wants, huh?

137
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,995
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa,     
     no, wait a second.

138
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:23,948
I didn't-- i did not make  
     a date with you.           
     What are you talk--

139
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:25,383
hey. Hello?

140
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,303
I can't believe that.  
         Twice in one day.

141
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,189
What's that,       
             sam?

142
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,291
Annie said i made a date       
 to have breakfast with her.

143
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,727
Spent 2 hours      
             waiting for me     
             at the roller rink

144
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,063
in french-cut panties  
         and a miniskirt.

145
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,499
I don't even have          
     my black book,             
     so i can't call her back.

146
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,101
That's your answer, sam.       
 There's some guy out there     
 with your book

147
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,921
that's making these dates      
 in your name                   
 and then not showing up.

148
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,840
Which means that       
         at this very moment,

149
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,008
there could be             
     dozens of gorgeous women

150
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,944
in french-cut panties  
         and miniskirts

151
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,578
just hangin' around 
            the roller rink,

152
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:57,314
and there's not        
         one damn thing         
         we can do about it.

153
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,953
(Sam)                      
     can someone give me        
     a ride?

154
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,724
My car's in the shop,   
        i swear to god.

155
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:18,819
Hey, are you guys going to see 
 mr. Clavin play  <i>jeopardy!?</i>

156
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,505
I don't know, wood.    
         I really can't decide.

157
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,191
Assumed that you'd go.      
    Cheer him on, you know.

158
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,960
Help him                    
    to have a friendly face     
    in the audience.

159
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,929
So, are you going?

160
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:32,283
I promised lilith              
 i'd stay at home and, uh,      
 clean the dog's ears.

161
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,654
Well, i'm sure goin'.

162
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,772
Yeah?      
 I want to be there             
 and see when they say,

163
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,075
"this is  <i>jeopardy!"</i>           
<i> And that big ball comes out</i>

164
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:44,078
and breaks into             
    a million pieces            
    and swirls away.

165
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:47,531
You know, it's just like       
 the sunrise in my hometown.

166
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,883
Woody, uh,

167
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:53,153
is there a big chemical plant  
 near hanover?

168
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,442
Sure, it's right over          
 the landfill right next to     
 the reservoir.

169
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,794
How did you know?

170
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,229
Lucky guess.

171
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,018
Hi, guys.

172
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,604
Hey, sam, i got                
 a bunch of messages for you.

173
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,472
Mostly girls               
     screamin' at you.

174
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,308
Oh, man.               
         This is sick.

175
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,426
(Sam)                      
     the guy is goin' through   
     my list of babes.

176
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,478
I mean, first the a's,         
 then the b's.

177
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:19,280
He's worked his way            
 through the g's.

178
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:21,382
I mean, where's he going       
 to strike next?

179
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,583
The h's.

180
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,503
Hey, that's good work,         
 dr. Crane.

181
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,005
You know,                      
 think like a criminal.

182
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:31,442
Or like somebody acquainted    
 with our alphabet.

183
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,794
All right, all right,  
         all right, sammy.      
         Here's what we do.

184
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:36,948
We get to the girls            
 that he hasn't contacted yet,  
 and we set a trap.

185
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,716
Oh, yeah, good idea.   
         Wait a minute.

186
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,203
Yeah, all right,            
    girls' last names           
    that begin with "h."

187
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,205
Hi, miss howe.                 
                     Hi, woody.

188
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,807
Oh, yeah.

189
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,459
Say, um...

190
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,495
[clearing throat]              
 honey, i have                  
 a little favor to ask you.

191
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:54,631
See, somebody out there's      
 got my little black book.

192
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,183
So?

193
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,470
So some guy is callin'         
 all the girls in it            
 and sayin' he's sam.

194
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:01,072
Right, then he sets up 
         dates with them,

195
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,823
has them put on 
                sexy outfits,

196
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,958
and i guess        
             he spies on them.

197
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,627
Sounds like you, sam.

198
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,364
No, but it's not bad.

199
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:11,899
(Carla)                
         anyways,

200
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:15,336
we want to use you             
 to help us set a trap          
 for this fiend.

201
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:19,524
Why would i want to            
 help sam get back              
 his great, big book of bimbos?

202
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,610
Because you're                 
 the next great, big bimbo      
 he's gonna call.

203
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,279
What?

204
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,531
Why am i in the list of women  
 you've gone to bed with?

205
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,584
They're not all women          
 that i've gone to bed with.

206
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:32,336
Just the important women       
 in my life, you know?

207
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:35,723
I mean, the women              
 i've gone to bed with,         
 my cleaning lady,

208
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,292
um, my mother, and you.

209
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,695
Of course, now that            
 i've gone to bed               
 with my cleaning lady,

210
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,180
that just leaves them,         
 mom, and you.

211
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,850
Come on.                       
                 No. Forget it.

212
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,686
Why don't you give             
 the guy a break?

213
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,820
Why should i?

214
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,890
Because if you don't,          
 i might have to bring up

215
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,492
that thing                     
 i happen to know about.

216
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,663
What thing?

217
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,648
It's a very personal thing     
 i happened to overhear.

218
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,567
You know                       
 what i'm talkin' about.

219
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,103
That thing,                    
 that if it ever got out

220
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,622
you won't be able to           
 show your face                 
 around here again.

221
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,641
What is it             
         you want me to do?

222
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,010
Do you have                 
    a short skirt?

223
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:15,263
Carla, that's amazing.

224
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,597
What have you   
                got on her?

225
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:19,000
Nothin'. I bluffed,            
 she crumbled.

301
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,275

         cost you $2,900.

 take a look at your response.

         That too is wrong.

316
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,077
The correct response is,

317
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:10,181
what were the real names    
    of cary grant, tony curtis, 
    and joan crawford?

     they haven't,

321
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,254
but obviously that's not    
    what we were going for

322
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,522
when we wrote up       
         that clue.

     You don't have to worry.

        more than $21,600,

 "$22,000 big ones"?

329
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,606
Which takes you    
             down to 0.

330
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:38,308
You bet it all.         
        Cliff, why would you do 
        something like that?

331
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:41,345
Because i knew that those      
 people had never been          
 in my kitchen.

00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,342
Nothin' but a loser.

391
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,445
Oh, it's ok, cliff. 
            We understand.

392
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,148
I can't believe                
 i lost on  <i>jeopardy!</i>

393
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:16,216
Oh, you were       
             on  <i>jeopardy!?</i>

394
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:25,826
All these years,               
 you know,

395
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:27,928
comin' off like a big genius,  
 big know-it-all.

396
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:29,196
[Scoffs]

397
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,964
i mean that game has been  
     a big part of my life.

398
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,733
And because of my greed,   
     i went out and desecrated  
     that, uh,

399
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,787
glorious american tradition 
    known as  <i>jeopardy!</i>

400
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,505
I'm worthless.                 
 I'm no good.

401
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:39,890
Oh, cliff,                  
    it's a game show,           
    for god's sake.

402
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,641
Don't be ridiculous.   
 What are you talking about?

403
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:43,510
And you blew $22,000.

404
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:46,112
What a jonah.      
             Do you believe     
             this guy?

405
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,849
Pitiful.

406
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,650
When this depraved sicko   
     with your book             
     does come in,

407
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,219
how are we             
         gonna recognize him?

408
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:53,453
I don't know.              
     We'll--

409
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,922
stop it.

410
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:58,092
Hey, hey,                      
 mister? Mister?

411
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,411
Have you seen a girl           
 wearing a black                
 leather miniskirt?

412
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:01,912
[Chuckling]                
     check the roller rink.

413
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,331
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:07,584
You wouldn't happen to be  
     sam malone, would you?

415
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,837
Who wants to know?

416
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,322
[Chuckling]

417
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,089
[laughing]             
         as a matter of fact,

418
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,641
i do.

419
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,760
Wow, what a coincidence.       
 Well, see ya.

420
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,746
Whoa, whoa,            
         come here, come here,  
         sit down,

421
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:20,080
will you? Hey.

422
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,565
Fork it over.

423
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:25,335
You want to just slip that     
 right in there?

424
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:27,754
Thank you.

425
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:30,174
Excuse me a second.

426
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:33,326
I'm rebecca howe,              
 the one you called             
 on the phone.

427
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:36,213
Now, you seem like             
 a nice adolescent.

428
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,981
I have a question              
 for you.

429
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,516
Why do you                     
 call up these women

430
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,551
and make dates with them       
 and then not show up?

431
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,353
Well, i wanted      
            to date them,

432
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,255
but i'm just a kid.

433
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,706
And after all,

434
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:49,243
i was afraid they wouldn't  
    take me seriously.

435
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:51,061
Isn't he precious?

436
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,866
So how come                
     you showed up this time?

437
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,334
Well, i thought             
    it might be easier with her

438
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,369
since there's only         
     one star by her name.

439
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,306
What?

440
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,892
The first star's free.     
     You gotta earn the rest.

441
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,263
You know, what you just did    
 is very serious.               
 It's not funny.

442
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,697
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:12,065
It's just that,

444
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,501
well, i've always wanted   
     to be a sam malone.

445
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:15,919
Oh, yeah?

446
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,538
Well, you want to be   
         a--a ball player?

447
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,058
No, i want to be       
         a babe hound.

448
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,542
You play ball?

449
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,663
Y-you know,                
     you want to be             
     a babe hound,

450
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,264
you're goin' at this   
         all wrong.

451
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,800
I am?              
        Yeah.

452
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,586
You don't start out        
     a full-blown babe hound.

453
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,822
You gotta start out        
     as a babe pup.

454
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,373
Now,

455
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,943
there gotta be girls           
 your age runnin' around        
 that school

456
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:41,395
that you can call.

457
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:42,363
Huh?

458
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,264
Guess you're right,    
         mr. Malone.

459
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,499
And listen, i'm sorry

460
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:47,468
i didn't return your book   
    when i first found it, sir.

461
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:48,718
Oh, that's no problem.

462
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,989
Look, uh, tell you what        
 i'm gonna do here.

463
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,807
I'm gonna give you $25.

464
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,976
Why don't you go off           
 and get a decent haircut,      
 huh?

465
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:58,645
And don't forget,

466
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:00,947
tip the shampoo girl.  
        Hey, thanks.

467
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:03,316
Yeah, fine.            
         Get out of here now.

468
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,119
[Chuckling]

469
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:10,857
makes you feel kinda good to   
 turn a kid like that around.

470
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:14,694
Yep,               
             you're a regular   
             father flanagan.

471
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:16,279
Well, you know             
     what i always say,

472
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,450
"there are no bad boys,        
 just boys with bad haircuts."

473
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,605
Hey.

474
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:26,890
Alex trebek.       
         Hello.

475
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,110
Hi, i've seen you              
 on  <i>jeopardy!</i>                  
<i> You're even cuter in person.</i>

476
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:31,711
Well, thank you very much.

477
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,447
Hey, could i ask you   
         a question?            
        Sure.

478
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,834
Do all you popular     
         game show hosts        
         know each other?

479
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,318
Oh, i see what                 
 you're getting at.

480
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:42,155
The answer is, no.          
    I don't know vanna white    
    all that well.

481
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,058
Good. Then you'll  
             believe me

482
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,095
when i tell you    
             that i'm better    
             than her in bed.

483
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,665
Will you excuse me?

484
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:57,954
Hey, i can turn over letters   
 you've never seen before.

485
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:05,979
Mr. Trebek. 
        Hello, cliff.

486
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:07,514
Hey, listen,                   
 i'm very sorry

487
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,849
about what happened to you     
 on our program                 
 this afternoon.

488
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:13,854
So you'd admit             
     that you were out of line  
     by tellin' me i was wrong?

489
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,872
Well, i wouldn't go            
 quite that far.

490
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,307
The fact is that

491
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,559
a case could be made           
 for your point of view.

492
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:22,646
I think the problem for us     
 was in the way                 
 we phrased our answer.

493
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,698
It allowed for more than       
 one possible question.

494
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,933
Yeah, see, see.        
         So you got my $44,000?

495
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,152
No. No, i don't.           
                     Huh?

496
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,903
Uh, well then,         
         you're probably gonna  
         have me back

497
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,873
as a returning contestant, 
     then, right?

498
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,907
No, we're not gonna            
 do that, either.

499
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,343
I know, this isn't             
 what you want to hear,

500
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,611
but believe me,            
     we're as upset

501
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,513
about what happened            
 as you are.

502
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:40,848
You know,                   
    it's a funny thing.

503
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:43,183
You spend years                
 hosting a show,

504
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,751
and you get into the habit     
 of thinking

505
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,054
there's just                   
 one correct question           
 for every answer.

506
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:49,823
But life doesn't always        
 work out that way.

507
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,859
The world                      
 is much more complex.

508
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:54,495
And you discover that          
 there are many different ways

509
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,129
of looking at the universe.

510
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:59,016
Yeah, so, uh,          
         what are you gonna do?

511
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,668
I think i'm gonna quit my job  
 as host of  <i>jeopardy!</i>

512
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:06,906
Maybe spend a little time      
 in tibet.

513
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:09,543
Oh, no. Alex, look.    
         Alex, sit down here.

514
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,111
I mean, y-you gotta--  
         you don't know         
         what you're sayin'.

515
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,764
Well, now, wait a minute.      
 How can i go on                
 hosting the program

516
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,651
if i'm filled                  
 with all these doubts?

517
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,302
All right, alex.

518
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,689
Think about what  <i>jeopardy!</i> 
    <i>Means to america.</i>

519
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,277
Now, i-it's more        
        than just a game show.

520
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,813
I mean, it--    
                it's as much

521
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,481
a part of           
            the national fabric

522
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,119
as the postal uniform  
         that i wear with pride 
         every single day.

523
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:39,823
So you think i should stay     
 as the host of  <i>jeopardy!?</i>

524
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,458
Absolutely.

525
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:43,843
And you won't bear me          
 any ill-will if i do?

526
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:45,595
Oh, bite your tongue.

527
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,780
All right. It's settled.

528
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:49,549
I'm gonna stay on              
 as the host of  <i>jeopardy!</i>

529
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,317
Oh, thank goodness, alex.

530
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:54,021
Hey. Hey.

            everybody?

531
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:57,457
I saved  <i>jeopardy!</i>

532
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:58,759
I'm gonna--                
     i'm gonna go call ma.

533
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:00,627
She'll get a big kick   
        out of this.

534
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:03,363
Alex.

535
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,498
Yeah.                      
         That's all right.      
         You're a regular guy.

536
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,018
Comin' in here             
     to make cliff feel better. 
     That's great.

537
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,036
I just came in here            
 for a beer, but i saw cliff,

538
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:11,438
and i figured                  
 i'd better say something,

539
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,007
so i made up that story        
 about quitting.

540
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:15,542
He scares me.

541
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,847
You, too, huh?

542
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:27,308
