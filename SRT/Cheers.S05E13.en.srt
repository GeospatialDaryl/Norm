00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,121
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:07,957
Hey, fellas, do me a favor.

3
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,459
You guys have had a few drinks.

4
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:11,461
Sit down. Let me buy you some coffee.

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,462
Aw, th-thanks anyway, Sam,

6
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:14,214
but everything's under control.

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,049
Pete hasn't had a thing
to drink all night.

8
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:17,550
He's our designated driver.

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,053
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
That's a good idea, Pete.

10
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,438
I'm not the designated driver.

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,358
I thought you were.

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,862
No, no, I-I'm not
the designated driver.

13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,230
What about you, Mark?

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,699
I'm with Sam. I think we
ought to try it sometime.

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,703
Wait right here. I'm
gonna call you a cab.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,711
Speaking of driving someone home,

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,080
since you've been drinking,
I'd be happy to give you a lift.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,914
Oh, thanks, but, uh,

19
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,916
all I've been drinking is soda water.

20
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,418
Oh.

21
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,803
Well, in that case, Woody,
make me a double martini.

22
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:00,477
One of us is getting
driven home tonight.

How are you today, Mr. Peterson?

41
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:21,374
Never been better, Woody.

42
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,377
You know, just once
I'd like to be better.

43
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,880
What's the matter there, Normie?

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,882
You look a little, uh,
down in the mouth, huh?

45
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,383
I don't know, Cliff.

46
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,253
There's something missing
from my life, I think.

47
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,588
I mean, sure, I got, you know,

48
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,592
the nice wife, uh,
career, a house, but...

49
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,595
I guess I'm talking about
that spiritual something

50
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,398
that can kind of give
it all meaning, you know?

51
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,566
Enable me to be at peace

52
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,519

53
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,238

Well, it sure is, Miss Chambers.

59
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,625
Especially if you like
it cloudy and damp.

60
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,128
Woody, I'm not talking about

61
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,630
superficial things, like the weather.

62
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,133
I'm talking about the day.

63
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:25,138
Today is going to be the
most special day of my life.

64
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,140
Do you believe in intuition?

65
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,141
No.

66
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,144
But I have this strange
feeling that someday I will.

67
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,065
Hi, guys.

68
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,451
Hey, Sammy!

69
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,370
What's the matter?

70
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,372
You got a weird look on your face.

71
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:45,792
I don't know if I should tell you.

72
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,793
Well, let me help you out.

73
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,161
Don't.

74
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,632
Well, Sam,

75
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,634
this morning I woke up with

76
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,636
the most overwhelming feeling

77
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,138
that you would propose to me today.

78
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,642
Whew. Talk about fate.
Talk about coincidence.

79
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,143
You have the same feeling?

80
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,646
No, I just wish you'd talk
about fate or coincidence.

81
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,149
Anything but marriage.

82
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,152
Look, I am not gonna
propose to you, Diane.

83
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,021
I know this sounds crazy.

84
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,409
It's not like me to be
given to mystical nonsense,

85
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,663
but the feeling is so strong.

86
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,949
It's an absolute certainty.

87
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,451
Well, if it's fate, it's fate.

88
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:30,336
Diane,

89
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,671
will you do me the honor of

90
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,674
becoming my
w-w-waitress?

91
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,175
(laughs)

92
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,180
Pretty good, huh?

93
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,182
Sam, will you give me a Cutty rocks?

94
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,184
Did you hear that?

95
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,020
Diane said she woke up

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,439
with this feeling that
I'm gonna propose to her.

97
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,940
The stupidest thing I've ever heard.

98
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,941
(loud clank)

99
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,942
Don't ever

100
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,360
make fun of a woman when

101
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,896
she says she has a
feeling about something.

102
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,398
Sammy,

103
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,900
you're tampering with
the psychic world here,

104
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,285
and you're gonna be sorry.

105
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,069
Oh, come on.

106
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,571
No, no, no, I'm serious.

107
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,573
It has to do with a woman's cycle.

108
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,077
See, somehow it's plugged
into the supernatural.

109
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,331
Oh, you're being ridiculous.

110
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,133
No, no, Sammy, please.
Come here. Please.

111
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,135
What? Just promise me

112
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,636
you'll be careful.

113
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,139
Okay, I'll be careful.

114
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,140
Thank you.

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,142
Oh, oh, oh, my God!

116
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,643
What? Ooh!

117
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,644
What?

118
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:30,146
Something's happened to me here. What?

119
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,648
Carla, get Diane over here.

120
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,651
I'm gonna ask her to
marry me... buddy Norm!

121
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,021
(laughs) Oh!

122
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,405
That's twice, man.

123
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,912
Hey, there, Sammy! Today's my big day!

124
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:46,913
All right, Tom.

125
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,414
Will you marry me?

126
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,284
(laughs)

127
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,703
The results of the last
bar exam are due out,

128
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:54,704
and I'm feeling lucky.

129
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:58,207
Hey, you know what they say,
eleventh time's the charm.

130
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,595
Okay, okay, okay, I had a
few problems in the past.

131
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,597
But this time, I really nailed it.

132
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,600
Tell me, Tom, is the
7-11 still giving out

133
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,553
a free Big Gulp with
every, uh, law degree?

134
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:15,058
Hey, Tom, how come you're not downtown

135
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,060
waiting for the old results, huh?

136
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,562
I got a friend calling me
here when they're posted.

137
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:22,065
But I got a hunch I did
pretty well this time.

138
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,067
Yeah, like General
Custer had a hunch that

139
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,069
the Little Big Horn was a gift
shop and picnic grounds, huh?

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,704
Hey, hey, lay off.

141
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,206
The guy's worked hard.

142
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,707
Woody,

143
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,709
how about a beer for our
future barrister here? Okay?

144
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:34,911
Thank you, Norm. All right.

145
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:35,745
So what, uh, what kind of law

146
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,630
are you gonna specialize in there, Tom?

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,881
Specialize?

148
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,250
So a free Big Gulp, you say, huh?

149
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,141
Sam, it doesn't have
to be a formal proposal.

150
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,642
Excuse me?

151
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,145
Well, we've already gone
the traditional route,

152
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,148
and I know how you
loathe long sentences.

153
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,150
I know you think I'm
gonna propose to you.

154
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,152
But, trust me, it's not gonna happen.

155
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,654
Before I ask you to marry me, Diane,

156
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,157
there'll be snowflakes
in hell, pigs will fly,

157
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,525
Norm will hate beer...

158
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,412
Hey, everybody, I'm an attorney!

159
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,415
Nah.

160
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,916
(laughs)

161
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,839
TV ANNOUNCER: Thank you,
Barbara G. Bridleton,

162
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,340
Miss Teeny Bikini, South Dakota.

163
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,341
Well, that's it.

164
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,843
I think Miss Arkansas
has got it hands down.

165
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,844
(mutters)

166
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,846
In your hat, Miss Arkansas.

167
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,848
Miss Nebraska's the class of this field.

168
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,349
Oh, yeah, Miss Nebraska.

169
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,852
I was particularly impressed
by her life's ambition

170
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,354
to work for world peace and
open an aerobics dance studio.

171
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,857
Now, wait a minute.
Look at this one here.

172
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,858
Ooh, yeah.

173
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,360
Not that often you see an
impression of Edward G. Robinson

00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,464
Gee, I'd love to propose to you, Diane,

181
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:04,467
but I'm tied up kind of
for the rest of my life.

182
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,638
Deep down inside,

183
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:10,389
you know this is going to happen.

184
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,177
You're going to propose to me.

185
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:16,812
You say that every day.

186
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,098
But I don't say this every day.

187
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,101
It's today.

188
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:27,523
That is one scary woman.

189
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:33,079
Sammy, come on. It's
late. It's time to go home.

190
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,580
It's my turn to lock up.

191
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,083
Besides, you look tired.
You need your rest.

192
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,584
And you might do something
stupid that you'll regret

193
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,086
for the rest of your life. Go on.

194
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,587
Would you relax, please?

195
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,090
Do I look like a guy who's
about to do something stupid?

196
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,092
Always.

197
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,094
That's not the point, Sam.

198
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,096
Leave me alone, will ya?

199
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,598
Guys, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna lock up now.

200
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,100
Yeah, all right, Sammy.

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,601
We can watch the rest of this meat show

202
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,602
over at Normie's house.

203
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,104
No, no, no. No, no, no.

204
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,606
Vera won't let me watch those,
uh, beauty contests, Cliffie.

205
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,607
Yeah? How come?

206
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,110
Well, she...she's says
they're degrading to women

207
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,112
and they make me randy as a jackrabbit.

208
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,949
Woody,

209
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,901
you go on home. I'll finish up here.

210
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,286
I want to be alone with Sam.

211
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,987
Run, Sam, run!

212
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,376
Diane, don't you think...

213
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,878
You know, on second thought,
guys, why don't you take off?

214
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,380
I'd like to have

215
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,882
a little private moment here with Diane.

216
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,387
That's it! It is all over!

217
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,256
Now...

218
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,007
I don't have the
strength to fight anymore.

219
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,010
All chance of victory is gone.

220
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,514
The only thing for me now is to go home,

221
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,016
pick up the pieces of my shattered life,

222
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,019
and try to go on.

223
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,523
Good night, Miss Chambers.

224
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,024
And, uh, good luck.

225
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,025
Oh, thanks, Woody.

226
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,027
But since Sam and I are
destined to be married,

227
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,530
luck is the one thing we don't need.

228
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,531
Oh.

229
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,032
Well, how about a salad bowl?

230
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,871
Yes, that would be nice.

231
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,257
Great. You saved me
some shopping. (chuckles)

232
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,258
Good night, Woody.

233
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,260
Good night, Sammy.

234
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,261
Good night, Woody.

235
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:15,131
Well, Sam, you clever boy.

236
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,134
Since you've arranged
for us to be alone,

237
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,635
I'm all ears.

238
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,638
But you better hurry. Almost midnight.

239
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,141
I wanted to talk to you alone

240
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,642
'cause I didn't want
to embarrass you in...

241
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,645
in front of the other people.

242
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,647
Sit down, will you, please?

243
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,535
Look, Diane...

244
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:41,791
I want you to stop this nonsense
about me proposing to you.

245
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,243
About us being married.

246
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,746
About us getting... about us period.

247
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,214
I've had it. That's it.

248
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,716
I don't want to hear any more.

249
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,502
Yes, Sam, fine, fine,

250
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:55,004
but you really should get at it, okay?

251
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,505
Would you stop it, please?

252
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,007
Man, you're making me nuts!

253
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,392
This is exactly what I'm talking about!

254
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,763
You know, all right,
it was fun for a while,

255
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,765
like a little game, but
it's not cute anymore.

256
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,266
It's serious, Diane.

257
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,235
You know, I-I was really

258
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,238
ticked off at first
when you turned me down.

259
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,241
But now I see how smart you were.

260
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,195
I am never gonna ask
you to marry me again.

261
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,196
Can I be any more clear than this?

262
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:24,700
I'm never gonna ask
you to marry me again.

263
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,202
Oh, no, oh, no, no, come on, Oh, no, no!

264
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,204
No, no, no, no, stop that!

265
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,088
Listen, you know how much

266
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,923
I hate it when you cry.

267
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,426
But I know you know, so it's
not gonna work. Forget it.

268
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,879
This really hadn't occurred to me...

269
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,467
...but I guess it's
actually a possibility.

270
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,853
I'm not listening. Uh-uh.

271
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,107
(humming)

272
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:53,979
Maybe you don't love me.

273
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,982
(sobbing): God in
heaven, it's not possible!

274
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,983
(laughs)

275
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,485
(continues sobbing)

276
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,986
Nothing! That's it!

277
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,488
It's not affecting me at all.

278
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,372
I'm immune to this stuff.

279
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,242
Yeah, you're not gonna soften me up.

280
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,243
No way. That's it.

281
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,245
(sobbing)

282
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,247
You know, it's not gonna
make me feel sorry for you.

283
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,249
In fact, I'll tell you
what it's gonna make me do.

284
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,750
You want to know what
it's gonna make me do?

285
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,252
I'm gonna tell you what
it's gonna make me do.

286
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,754
It's gonna make me propose
to you, is what it's gonna do.

287
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:22,141
Oh, come on, don't...don't cry.

288
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,095
Oh, Diane,

289
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,980
will you marry me?

290
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,764
No, Sam.

291
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:31,650
(steel bars slamming)

292
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,104
PRIEST: The Lord is my
Shepherd; I shall not want.

293
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,106
In verdant pastures, He gives me repose.

294
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,608
Beside restful waters, He leads me.

295
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,610
He refreshes my soul...

296
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,581
Oh, Warden, have you heard
from the governor yet?

297
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,584
I'm sorry, Sam.

298
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,586
Oh, well.

299
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:52,087
He maketh me lie down in green pastures;

300
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,590
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

301
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,091
He restoreth my soul;

302
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:58,093
He leadeth me in the paths of ri...

303
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,597
Father, do you really
believe in the afterlife?

304
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:05,718
Yes, my son, I do.

305
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,219
Well, good.

306
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:13,225
Maybe I can find her
there, and... get her again!

307
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,611
(creaking)

308
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:16,312
(groans)

309
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,198
Mmm-mmm! Ooh!

310
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,200
What's wrong?

311
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,702
Mmm. Oh...

312
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,703
I just had a flash

313
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,706
that I got the electric
chair for killing you.

314
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,213
Well, that's silly.

315
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,217
Massachusetts doesn't
have the death penalty.

316
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,586
What?

317
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,926
Uh...

318
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,846
Nothing. Nothing at all.

319
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:53,349
No death penalty, huh?

320
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,850
No, not at present,

321
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,355
but I'm-I'm sure they're...
going to reinstate it.

322
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,861
In fact, I'm on my way to...

323
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,863
campaign for it at this very moment.

324
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:08,864
Excuse me.

325
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:10,366
(squeals)

326
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,826
Hey, everybody, you're
not going to believe this.

327
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,827
Well, you passed the bar.

328
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,212
I'll believe anything.

329
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:27,082
Yeah? Well, Sam's in jail, smarty pants.

330
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,083
What? Yeah.

331
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,553
Diane had him arrested
for assault and battery.

332
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:34,056
My hero.

333
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,592
Is Diane all right?

334
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:37,593
I think she's fine.

335
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,595
I just don't have all the details.

336
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:40,596
Well, how do you know all this stuff?

337
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,597
Sam called me

338
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:43,098
to retain my services.

339
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:46,602
Oh, to do what, prune his trees?

340
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,103
Has he been arraigned yet?

341
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:49,104
No, 2:00.

342
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,105
CARLA: Well, maybe

343
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,607
we ought to go down to the courthouse

344
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,609
in case Sammy needs character witnesses.

345
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,611
No, they don't do that
until the trial, Carla.

346
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,079
Well, what sort of
defense you plan on using?

347
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,081
I'm thinking about pleading insanity.

348
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,083
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

349
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,084
What about Sammy?

350
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,128
Bail is set at $2,500.

351
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:14,630
Next case.

352
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,640
Your Honor, I swear I never touched her.

353
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,525
Take a seat.

354
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,896
Case number one five
seven eight six--

355
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,398
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

356
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,399
versus Sam Malone.

357
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:34,900
Defendant is charged

358
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,402
with willful assault...

359
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,404
(clattering thud)

360
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:40,906
Oh, what is this?

361
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,908
I swear I never laid a
hand on her, Your Honor.

362
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,410
Mr. Malone...

363
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,412
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Just take a seat, Miss...

364
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,414
Chambers. Thank you.

365
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,416
JUDGE: The defendant is charged

366
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,418
with willful assault and battery

367
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,919
against the person
of one Diane Chambers.

368
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,304
How does the defendant plead?

369
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:56,722
Not guilty.

370
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,724
Motions, gentlemen.

371
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,225
Your Honor,

372
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,645
due to the violent
circumstances of this crime,

373
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,146
and in order to protect the victim

374
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,648
from a reoccurrence of
the events of evening last,

375
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:08,651
the State recommends that
bail be set at an amount

376
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,403
commensurate with the serious
nature of this offense.

377
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,187
Motion denied.

378
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:13,188
Hey! I'm the one that's

379
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,573
supposed to say that.

380
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,361
Right, right.

381
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,613
Sorry, Your Honor,
uh, it's my first case.

382
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,915
You're kidding!

383
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,337
Your Honor, my client, uh,

384
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,339
has no prior convictions or arrests.

385
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,340
A well-known businessman

386
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,342
and respected member of this community.

387
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,344
I therefore move that bail be waived

388
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:36,845
and he be released on
his own recognizance.

389
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,347
I don't think Mr. Malone poses

390
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,349
any general threat to
the community; so moved.

391
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,216
All right!

392
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,802
Sorry, Your Honor.

393
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,308
Trial is set for two months
from this date at 10:00 a.m.

394
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,277
All right, everybody,
it's been a long day.

395
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,279
This court will reconvene
tomorrow morning.

396
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,781
Your Honor?

397
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,784
Yes, Miss, uh... Chambers?

398
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,285
Would it be all right

399
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,788
if I said something at this time?

400
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,791
I don't think that's really necessary.

401
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,161
I think it might help
to expedite matters.

402
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,914
Well, if you must, but please be brief.

403
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:14,333
Oh, geez...!

404
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,339
Your Honor, I just want you to know...

405
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,224
Should I come up there?

406
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,510
Why not?

407
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,398
Your Honor, I, I just want you to know

408
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,899
that I understand
why the accused--

409
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,402
and, by the way, the
man I intend to marry--

410
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,270
was, uh,

411
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,239
was upset last night.

412
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,241
After all, I did just turn down

413
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:41,243
his proposal of marriage.

414
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,245
I see. But if you intend to marry him,

415
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,247
why did you say no to his proposal?

416
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:48,250
It's a long story.

417
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,251
Make it a short one,

418
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,254
and maybe we can save the
good people of Massachusetts

419
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,622
the cost of a trial.

420
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,874
Well, let's see.

421
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,875
Um, the accused and I

422
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,877
have been going together

423
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,879
on and off for about four years.

424
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,383
I guess you could
describe our relationship

425
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,884
as a bit stormy,

426
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,387
but that's also part of its excitement.

427
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,391
Earlier this year,

428
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,892
the accused proposed to me.

429
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,778
I said no

430
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,029
because I thought

431
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,031
he was on the rebound
from another relationship.

432
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,532
I was wrong,

433
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,818
so I changed my mind.

434
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,370
But he wouldn't propose to
me again, the little dickens.

435
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,791
Until last night, that is,

436
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,326
but this time I fear...

437
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:34,329
he was only asking me to marry him

438
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,832
because I was crying and upset...

439
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,834
albeit unintentional.

440
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,837
It was emotional blackmail on my part.

441
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,305
I couldn't say yes

442
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,808
under those circumstances.

443
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:46,809
You do understand,

444
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,811
don't you, Your Honor?

445
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:51,313
I'm sorry, I was just trying to imagine

446
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,182
the long version of the story.

447
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,942
Although... gallant,

448
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,160
his proposal

449
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,195
couldn't have been sincere.

450
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,696
The accused was merely respons...

451
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:10,833
Hey, will you say my
na... Sam, my name is Sam.

452
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,334
Make her say my name, will you please?

453
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,336
Calm down, Mr. Malone.

454
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,338
Go on, Miss Chambers.

455
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:19,341
Well, the next thing I know, the acc...

456
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,844
Sam is chasing me
down the street--

457
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,846
for six blocks,
to be exact--

458
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,347
until I tripped and fell...

459
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,183
...thus sustaining my injuries,

460
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,102
a bruised thigh and a wrenched neck.

461
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,104
Did he hit you or push you in any way?

462
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,607
Well, no.

463
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,608
Not exactly.

464
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,609
JUDGE: Look, Miss Chambers,

465
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,611
it doesn't appear that Mr. Malone

466
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,613
is directly responsible
for your injuries.

467
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,615
Now, is there any way
I could persuade you

468
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,117
to drop the charges against him?

469
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,321
I have a solution, if
it pleases the court.

470
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,824
If you can get us out of this,
it absolutely thrills the court.

471
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,827
What if my client proposes to her again?

472
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,828
Yes, I could alwa...

473
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,330
Are you crazy?!

474
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,333
(bangs gavel)

475
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,334
I like the idea.

476
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,753
Does the State have any
objections to his proposing?

477
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:06,255
None, Your Honor.

478
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,256
How about it, Miss Chambers?

479
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,257
This all right with you?

480
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:15,731
I suppose it would be all right
if it were a sincere proposal.

481
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,735
Well, I guess it's
your move, Mr. Malone.

482
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:21,236
You mean, I have to propose to her

483
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,237
to keep from going to jail

484
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,239
where I wouldn't be
going in the first place

485
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,241
if she'd said yes to any
one of my three proposals?

486
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,194
That's a very ironic way of putting it.

487
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,615
Now, which is it going to
be, a wedding or a trial?

488
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,120
How long would I have to be in jail?

489
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,628
Diane, will you marry me?

490
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:50,465
That didn't sound very sincere.

491
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:55,971
I ask the court, did that sound sincere?

492
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:56,972
No, it didn't.

493
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:00,475
Try again.

494
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:04,980
Y-You, you have no idea
what you're sentencing me to.

495
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,984
Mr. Malone, come up here
and let's get this over with.

496
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,082
Diane...

497
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,002
will you marry me?

498
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,647
Okay.

499
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:39,648
JUDGE: Case dismissed.

500
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:40,515
(pounds gavel)

501
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:41,483
Congratulations.

502
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:42,985
BAILIFF: All rise.

503
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,987
What do you know?

504
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,488
I got you off!

505
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,991
Thank you, Tom. Yeah,

506
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,993
Yeah, all in a day's
work, Sammy, my boy.

507
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:54,496
You're looking at
Thomas Babson, Esquire...

508
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:55,998
undefeated.

509
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:58,500
Oh, Tom?

510
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,502
Uh, if you got any time next week,

511
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:01,503
my trees need pruning.

512
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:03,505
How about Saturday? Be fine; thanks.

513
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:08,710
Well,

514
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,179
guess I don't need this for a while.

515
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:27,279
Sam... I'm sorry.

516
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,234
I guess I got a little carried away.

517
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,735
(sighing)

518
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:37,239
I wanted to expose our relationship

519
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,741
to the scrutiny of the court.

520
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,162
God knows I've tried to figure it out.

521
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,164
I'm at a complete loss.

522
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,166
Oh, it makes perfect sense to me.

523
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:53,171
You want me to propose
to you. I propose to you.

524
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,175
You say no, I say fine, I
never want to see you again.

525
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,560
You drive me nuts

526
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,929
telling me you want me to propose again.

527
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,431
I do, you turn me down.

528
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,434
Next thing I know, I'm in a court of law

529
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:08,937
where I've got to propose
to you or I'll go to jail.

530
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,440
It's the classic American love story.

531
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,197
That's pretty absurd.

532
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,534
Well, don't worry.

533
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,538
I'm not going to hold
you to that proposal.

534
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,507
I know it was made

535
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,041
under duress.

536
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:33,845
(sighing)

537
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,847
Bye, Sam.

538
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,850
Where are you going?

539
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,354
You know, you're not
going to get off that easy.

540
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:46,358
No, you're going to pay
for what you put me through.

541
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,859
What do you mean?

542
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,362
I proposed to you, you said yes.

543
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,864
Now, they can stop me from killing you,

544
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,367
but they can't stop
me from marrying you.

545
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,205
Oh, Sam!
