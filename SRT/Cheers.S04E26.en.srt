1
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:06,310
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:09,425
You sending another recorded
message home to the folks, Wood?

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,550
Oh, yeah. lt's a lot cheaper
than a phone call.

4
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:16,512
Hi, folks. This is your son, Woody...

5
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,230
...Boyd.

6
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:21,628
But enough about me.

7
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,750
You know, things have been getting
really crazy around Cheers lately.

8
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:26,584
Remember l told you that
Sam was going out

9
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:30,267
with this real pretty politician lady
named Janet Eldridge?

10
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:32,787
Well, things are still going
hot and heavy.

11
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,344
Oh, Miss Chambers quit.

12
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:39,831
Yeah, l think this stuff between Sam
and Miss Eldridge finally got to her.

13
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:43,621
Anyway, she says she's never
coming back in here again.

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,066
Gee, l'm gonna miss her.

15
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:48,151
Well, that's it. Bye.

16
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,584
Let's hear how it sounds.

17
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:57,064
We shall fight on the seas
and the oceans.

18
00:00:57,232 --> 00:01:02,465
We shall fight in growing confidence
and growing strength in the air.

19
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:04,581
You know, l guess it's true.

20
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:08,267
You listen to the sound of your own
voice, it always sounds different.

21
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:21,661
Afternoon, everybody.

22
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:23,191
Norm!

23
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,865
How you feeling today,
Mr Peterson?

24
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,188
- Poor.
- Oh, l'm sorry to hear that.

25
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,661
No, l meant, pour.

26
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:36,662
- Trouble in paradise, Norm?
- No, at home, Cliffie.

27
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:39,300
l just put Vera on the train
to Springfield.

28
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,545
l have to spend the next few days
at home alone with her oversexed,

29
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,624
exhibitionist sister, Donna.

30
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,991
Maybe she's an innocent kid, and
you misinterpret her friendliness.

31
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,545
Maybe you're right.

32
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:55,307
You tell me, is it normal for a girl
to get dressed on the front lawn?

33
00:02:57,432 --> 00:03:00,390
Hey, hey.
Didn't you see the sign outside?

34
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:04,261
We reserve the right to refuse service
to skinny ex-waitresses

35
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,992
with bad dye jobs.

36
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:11,141
Oh, Carla, couldn't we make
an exception just this once?

37
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,265
Thanks, Woody.

38
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:15,343
But l'm not here for the potables.

39
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,230
l'm here to see Sam.

40
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:21,381
He should be down in a few minutes.
He's at Melville's with Miss Eldridge.

41
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,508
She's telling him what to say
and what not to say

42
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:24,946
at the press conference today.

43
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,270
Oh, there's a press conference?

44
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:29,667
Yeah, and it's gonna be right here
in the bar.

45
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:32,263
Oh, that's quite unorthodox.

46
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,589
No, l think it's open to all faiths.

47
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,352
l'll have a seltzer, please.

48
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:42,582
Hey, whitey.

49
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:47,065
About that dye job crack...

50
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,143
...l'm sorry.

51
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:54,145
You're sorry? l don't think l've heard
you say that before. Thanks, Woody.

52
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:56,190
Yeah, l know.

53
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,546
But...

54
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,748
...l figure it's about time.

55
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:03,700
l mean, now that you're
Boston's number-one loser,

56
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:07,182
l'm feeling kind of different
about you.

57
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:09,263
l'm flattered.

58
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:11,863
ln fact...

59
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:15,345
...l wanna apologize for all
the crummy things

60
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:18,026
l've said to you over the years.

61
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:22,181
Why, thank you, Carla.

62
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:27,064
Except for that one
about your lizard lips.

63
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:31,227
- l like that one.
- Exception noted.

64
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:32,507
And...

65
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:37,382
...you know, the one about you having
a personality you could store meat in.

66
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:40,191
l'd like to keep that one alive too.

67
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,951
This is so like you.

68
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:49,869
Covering up what are obviously
some very fine, warm feelings.

69
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:55,186
But l happen to know what you're
really saying is you like me.

70
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,942
You're touching me.

71
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:05,467
- lt's called communication.
- No, it's called a death wish.

72
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,071
Hey, Diane, l understand
you're hitting the bricks

73
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:11,109
in Unemployment City
there along with Normie.

74
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,746
Oh, actually,
l've found other employment.

75
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:16,864
Oh, yeah? See that, Norm?
What's the job that you landed there?

76
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:19,185
Well...

77
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,469
...it's only temporary until l hear about
this other job.

78
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:25,192
ln fact, it's so temporary l don't even
bother to take my coat off

79
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:28,150
when l'm there, if you get my point.

80
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:31,304
l'm a checkout clerk
at Hurley's Market.

81
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,944
What?

82
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:36,785
A checkout clerk at Hurley's Market.
Are you deaf?

83
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,908
Hey, Diane, that's where l shop.

84
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,824
Next time l come in, l'll say hi.

85
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:43,751
lf you don't, l'll be angry.

86
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,067
Well, excuse me, l have to make a call
about that other job.

87
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:51,622
l'm sure Sam won't mind me
using his office.

88
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,823
Cheers.

89
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,903
Oh, just a minute, please.

90
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:59,467
lt's for you, Mr Peterson.

91
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,906
Hello.

92
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:04,382
- Oh, hi, Donna.
- Hey. Donna.

93
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:06,469
Yeah.

94
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:10,310
Yeah, l don't know.
Usual time, l guess.

95
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:12,110
Fine, yeah. No, it sounds great.

96
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,103
Okay.

97
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:18,345
- What did she want, Norm?
- ''What did she want, Norm?''

98
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,582
What she wanted was, she wanted
me to come home early.

99
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:23,266
She's making a turkey dinner,
all right?

100
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:27,266
And then she paused
and said there'd be no dressing.

101
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:29,944
Do you...

102
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:33,345
...suppose she meant the bird or us?

103
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:38,824
Either way, there's gonna be some
plump, succulent thighs at that table.

104
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:51,351
- Hi, Miss Chambers.
- Hi, Woody.

105
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,106
- l thought you left.
- No, no, l'm waiting for Sam.

106
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:55,546
l have a call to make.

107
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:58,141
Well, he's up in the restaurant.
l can go get him if you want.

108
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,780
l mean, he's probably just eating
or something.

109
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,349
No, that's okay. Thank you.

110
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,622
l have calls to make.

111
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:11,231
Actually, Woody, l'm not really
in here to make phone calls.

112
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:15,067
l came back to apologize to Sam.

113
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:17,792
l loathe to admit that l...

114
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:21,228
...eavesdropped on a conversation
he had with Janet the other day,

115
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:23,587
and that's inexcusable.

116
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:28,102
My conscience was bothering me,
so l came back to confess.

117
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:33,226
Thus allowing me to close
this chapter in my life.

118
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,190
Okey-dokey.

119
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:39,302
Woody? Woody?

120
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:40,947
May l ask you a question?

121
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:45,221
Sure, if you're not fussy
about the answer.

122
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:51,950
Has Sam ever talked to you about
his feelings toward Miss Eldridge?

123
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,824
Well...

124
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:56,665
...l heard him say that he kind
of likes her.

125
00:07:56,832 --> 00:08:00,507
But in my opinion, you and Sam
make a much better couple.

126
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,867
- Really?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,862
You're my two favourite people
in the whole world.

128
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:13,748
Oh, Woody.

129
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:17,790
Thank you.

130
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,908
Except for my parents.

131
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,746
- l know.
- And my teachers at school.

132
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:27,665
Oh, wait a minute. l can put you
ahead of my 8th grade teacher,

133
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:29,185
Mr Thorndike.

134
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:33,630
He always had chalk on his suit
and he smelled kind of funny.

135
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,067
But, you know, l don't wanna hurt
Mr Thorndike's feelings,

136
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,587
so let's just forget this conversation.

137
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,822
l was planning to, Woody.

138
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:42,867
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Woody.

139
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:48,425
Could we go into your office? l need
to talk to you about a personal matter.

140
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,150
Sam, this is serious.

141
00:08:58,352 --> 00:08:59,910
So is this.

142
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:03,865
We have this press conference
today, and l just want you to know

143
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,671
that it's becoming increasingly difficult
for me to answer questions

144
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:09,392
- about what our future plans are.
- Why?

145
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:12,112
Because l don't know
what our future plans are.

146
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,511
Wait, wait, what are you saying?

147
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,503
Well, this may sound
a little old-fashioned,

148
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,311
but l guess l'm asking
what your intentions are toward me.

149
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,307
lntentions?

150
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:29,462
Well, l mean, haven't you ever thought
about you and me tying the knot?

151
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,630
Oh, now, you told me you didn't
go in for that kinky stuff.

152
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:39,871
Okay. All right, all right.

153
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:42,063
Well, do you...?

154
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:44,661
You see, you see...

155
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:50,031
You and l really have never even
talked about, you know--

156
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,989
- The word is marriage, Sam.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:53,380
lt won't bite you.

158
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,146
Reporters are bound to ask about us
at the press conference today.

159
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:58,143
l don't know what we're
gonna tell them. Do you?

160
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,143
Well...

161
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,427
...gee, l-- l don't--

162
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:04,385
- l don't know that--
- Oh, take it easy, Sam.

163
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,383
- What?
- l'm not trying to trap you.

164
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:09,112
Oh, are you kidding?
l don't feel trapped.

165
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,906
Excuse me. Let me, let me just...

166
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,063
l'm not putting any pressure
on you, darling.

167
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,740
l know a man like you hates
that kind of thing from a woman.

168
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,227
lt's just in my profession,
l have to take things seriously

169
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:22,189
because l'm in the public eye.

170
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,912
lt'd be different if l worked
in a supermarket or something.

171
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:31,141
All l'm saying is that it's something
we have to think about.

172
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:34,230
We can't go on indefinitely
like we have been.

173
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:37,981
Not that l have any complaints
about what we have been.

174
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,188
Okay, l'll give it some thought.
l will. l promise.

175
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,383
Good. l'll see you later.

176
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,184
Okay.

177
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:48,950
- Sam?
- Yeah, what?

178
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:51,182
l just wanted to remind you again.

179
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:53,104
When are you gonna replace
Miss Chambers?

180
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,701
- You haven't put an ad in the paper.
- l'll get to it, Woody.

181
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,430
Well, you keep saying that.

182
00:10:57,632 --> 00:11:02,148
- Would you stop bugging me, please?
- Okay, Sam. Sorry.

183
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,710
By the way...

184
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:10,102
...where is Miss Chambers?

185
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:12,661
Hey, how should l know
where she is, Wood?

186
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:14,185
Give me a break, will you?

187
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,149
She came in here to wait.

188
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:18,587
- She what?
- Yeah.

189
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:25,220
Wait on...

190
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:29,829
...tables here at Cheers,
and you fired her.

191
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:32,028
And you know the rest.

192
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,425
Thank you for the recap, Woody.

193
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,466
Miss Chambers?

194
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:48,592
l covered for your eavesdropping
this time, but you know,

195
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,470
l think you have a real problem.

196
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:56,864
l think you ought to get some help.

197
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:01,110
l will, Woody. l promise.

198
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:03,103
Do me one favour, will you?

199
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:06,582
Please, just tell me when Sam steps
into the men's room.

200
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,632
Oh, God, it's worse than l imagined.

201
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,551
l can't believe this.

202
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:31,349
Cameras, reporters,
government officials.

203
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:35,388
And to think, only a few short months
ago, l was back in lndiana

204
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,622
pumping suds for a bunch of bozos.

205
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:39,788
Hey, goober, how about pouring us
another round?

206
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,948
Coming right up.

207
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,901
Hey, Woody, give us a couple of beers,
will you?

208
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,626
- Hey, where you guys been?
- Normie took me to meet Donna,

209
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,145
the alleged Lolita.

210
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:52,543
Yeah, maybe she's not quite as bad
as l made her out to be.

211
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:54,668
Are you kidding?
She's the sweetest, most innocent

212
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:57,062
freckle-faced youngster
l ever wanted to meet.

213
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,348
And for you to imply she was
unwholesome and behaved

214
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,868
in a salacious manner towards
you is unbelievable.

215
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,308
Well, maybe my imagination's
a little overactive, l guess.

216
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:09,902
Especially if you think that
that young lady is coming on to you.

217
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,984
She's coming on to me
like gangbusters.

218
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:17,747
Cliffie, you know, you're really kind of
a handy guy to have around.

219
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,062
Just when l think l've gone
completely off the deep end,

220
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:25,181
l look over at you, and there you are
diving off the cliffs at Acapulco.

221
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:30,026
Yeah, but looking mucho primo
in my bikini briefs, eh?

222
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:34,826
Excuse me.

223
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:40,030
Well, if it isn't Rebecca
of Skinnybrook Farm.

224
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:43,465
Shouldn't you be out collecting
shopping carts?

225
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:50,670
Well, l was in the neighbourhood,
and l thought l'd drop by and unwind.

226
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:53,869
Sure. lt just happens to be

227
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:57,263
five minutes before Sam and Janet's
press conference.

228
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:00,631
Oh, is that today?

229
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,101
Mercy. Well, l'm a concerned citizen.

230
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,422
Perhaps l'll just stick around
and see what happens.

231
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:08,021
Okay, l think we're ready now.

232
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:12,991
- Well, Sam, we're on.
- Wait a-- Wait a minute.

233
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:14,860
l don't know about this tie.

234
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:17,102
Come on. When have you ever
not looked fabulous?

235
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,467
Oh, yeah, right. Right.

236
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,270
Shows you how nervous l am, huh?

237
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,662
- You'll be just fine.
- Yeah. Thanks.

238
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,385
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:29,824
We hold so many of our press
conferences in my stuffy old office,

240
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:31,903
l thought it would be nice to show
you reporters

241
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,664
what the inside of a bar
looks like.

242
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:37,384
There won't be any opening statement
today. l'll just take your questions.

243
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:41,707
Councillor Eldridge, what's your priority
in your next two years of office?

244
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,391
You must be new in town.

245
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,101
Mass transit.

246
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:49,590
l'll see to it that Boston has the finest
system in this country or die trying.

247
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,750
Councillor, in view of your re-election
to city council,

248
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:56,541
l'd like to pose a question that l'm sure
is on everybody's mind here today.

249
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,389
How do you think the Red Sox
are gonna do this season?

250
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:03,868
Why don't l turn this over to my
special consultant on this issue,

251
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:05,226
Mayday Malone.

252
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:17,068
Whether the Red Sox
do well or not is not the point.

253
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:20,702
l think they're gonna bring a lot
of money into this city,

254
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:26,902
and that can do nothing but help
the tax base of our fair city.

255
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:30,951
ln layman's terms, the Sox are gonna
clean up this year.

256
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,829
- l have a question.
- What? What are you--?

257
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:38,341
Excuse me.
What paper do you represent?

258
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:42,264
Hurley's Market Shopper's Guide.

259
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:48,826
l'm afraid this is for
newspaper reporters only.

260
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,229
Oh, l'm sorry.
l thought this was America.

261
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,390
No, no, Phil, it's okay.

262
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:58,510
- Hello again, Miss Chambers.
- Hello, and thank you.

263
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:00,867
Councillor, on the less political side,

264
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:03,148
there seems to be a lot of interest
in the two of you.

265
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:07,908
Mr Malone, would you care to
comment on your plans for the future?

266
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,347
l thought we'd grab a pizza,
then try to catch a movie

267
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,503
on the tube later on.

268
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,911
How delightful.
But let me be a little more specific.

269
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:21,111
The hottest topic in town is whether
or not there are wedding bells

270
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:22,950
in Sam and Janet's future.

271
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:26,542
Can you confirm or deny these
rumours? Give us a scoop.

272
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,902
l'm sure there are more important
issues to be discussed

273
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,551
in this forum than that,
Miss Chambers.

274
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:33,630
What do you have to say
about this marriage business, Sam?

275
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:38,664
Oh, well, gee, l-- l don't know if--

276
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,624
l don't think this is the time
or the place--

277
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,501
No, wait, wait.
Actually, l'll-- l will handle this.

278
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,230
Sweetheart.

279
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,507
Fellas, l think we're jumping
the gun a little bit here.

280
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:52,789
l mean, we've only known each other
about four months, so--

281
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,586
Really? By my calculations,
it's only six weeks.

282
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,191
Whatever.

283
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,949
Perhaps it just seems longer.

284
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,221
Next question, please.

285
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:04,788
Councillor, do you agree
with Mr Malone that the relationship

286
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,783
seems to be dragging on?

287
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,387
Yeah, l-- l know what
you're trying to do here, Diane.

288
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:12,826
How dumb do you think l am?

289
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,909
l believe we're supposed to ask
the questions.

290
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:17,222
Janet, how dumb do you think
Sam is?

291
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:24,308
Could we please confine our questions
to matters of public interest, please?

292
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:28,784
Councillor, how do you plan to alleviate
the overnight parking problem?

293
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,141
The overnight parking problem,

294
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:32,826
unfortunately, cannot be solved
overnight.

295
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:36,223
l have, however, persuaded the city
council to hasten the formation

296
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,548
of a fact-finding committee
for the purpose

297
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,947
of looking into selecting sites.

298
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:43,302
Of course, there are problems
to contend with, such as

299
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,662
environmental-impact studies
and reports. Stop it!

300
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,060
All right, that's it!

301
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:48,705
You see that?
She just squirted me!

302
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,107
- She has a little yellow squirt--
- Will you stop this?

303
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:53,143
Yeah, all right. l'll stop it. l'm all right.

304
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:56,384
Yeah, l'm gonna escort this woman
out of my bar forever.

305
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,264
Very well.

306
00:17:58,432 --> 00:17:59,626
l'll leave.

307
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,545
And l never want to see
your fat, ugly face again.

308
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:07,667
- You're about to see my fat, ugly fist.
- l'm shaking in my boots.

309
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,823
- My tie.
- Going up.

310
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:23,867
l believe the gentleman from
The Globe had a question.

311
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:32,189
Well, l certainly have to hand it
to you, Sammy.

312
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:34,468
You throw one helluva
press conference.

313
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:37,265
l haven't seen
such an ugly scene

314
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:40,344
since my kids' school picture.

315
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:43,628
l just got off the phone
with the last newspaper.

316
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,748
l'm not sure how much damage
was done.

317
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:46,901
What'd you say?

318
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:49,222
l told them you took some
sinus medication

319
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:50,905
and had an allergic reaction.

320
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:53,063
- They buy it?
- Not unless there's something else

321
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,984
you can put in a crock.

322
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:59,067
Oh, come on. l know it was a bit
unpleasant earlier tonight,

323
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:02,383
but, l mean, when you look back on it,
you can't help but laugh.

324
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:06,345
Unless you try really hard.

325
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,941
Oh, come on.
Now, there's a grin in there.

326
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,830
Come on.
Now, that'll turn into a smile.

327
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,592
All right, there you go.
Come on, l'm sorry.

328
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,186
How the hell did l ever
get into this mess?

329
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,064
l'm crazy about a guy who's
the worst thing in the world for me.

330
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:22,783
We can't go on like this, Sam.

331
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:24,705
You have no regard for my career.

332
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,703
And what's worse,
you have no regard for me.

333
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,988
You lied when you said
you had no feelings for Diane.

334
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:32,628
- You obviously have strong feelings.
- No, no, come on, please. That--

335
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:35,027
No, Sam, face it.

336
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:39,105
You're trying to leave every option
open, and you just can't do that.

337
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:43,424
You have to make some choices
and some commitments.

338
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:46,231
lt's called growing up.

339
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:12,149
Boy, looks like Sammy
got his walking papers.

340
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,950
l know how he feels.

341
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:15,710
l think we've all been there before.

342
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:20,986
Well, it's never happened to me, so l
guess l'll just have to imagine it, huh?

343
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:26,703
Cliffie, l think you actually have to go
with someone before you get dumped.

344
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:35,061
Good night. Good night.

345
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,790
See you guys later. Drive carefully.

346
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,425
Why don't we do this tomorrow, huh?
Let's go home.

347
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:44,351
No argument here. l'm beat.

348
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:50,387
Boy, Sam, you had a rough day today.
You lost two great gals in one day.

349
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,151
Two?

350
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:54,951
Well, yeah, you know, l always thought
that someday Miss Chambers

351
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:58,229
would be Mrs Malone.
That's crazy, huh?

352
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,781
Well, Woody, there are more
where they came from.

353
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,428
You know, l'm glad you said that

354
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:08,028
because there's this girl in my building
l wish you could meet.

355
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:11,861
She's really cute.
She's got a great personality.

356
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:16,628
She's really fun to be with,
and she has got a gorgeous figure.

357
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:21,183
And if l were a young single guy
in this town...

358
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,422
See you tomorrow, Sam.

359
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,070
- You okay?
- l don't know, Carla.

360
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:40,349
l think l screwed up my life here.

361
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:44,630
l mean, look at me. l'm pushing 40,
and what have l got to show for it?

362
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,903
Maybe it's time l settle down, huh?

363
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:54,031
Maybe the time's right
for Mayday to get married.

364
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,542
The answer is yes.

365
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:00,904
You didn't ask a question, did you?

366
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:05,429
Listen, Sam, when the right dame
comes along, you'll know it.

367
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:08,351
Well, that's what l'm afraid of.
l think she did, and l let her go.

368
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:13,580
No. She didn't come along yet.
Casabas are your destiny, Sam.

369
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:15,310
Hold out.

370
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:19,062
- Good night.
- Good night.

371
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,027
Hi, it's-- lt's me.

372
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,591
Look...

373
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:04,701
...l've been thinking about you.

374
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,942
Oh, what the hell.
Will you marry me?
