1
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,626
I'LL BE SEEING YOU (PART 1 )

2
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:14,508
OK, everybody, Iisten up. It's time once
again for the third annuaI Cheers picnic.

3
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:18,971
I'II need voIunteers for
the committees. First, food.

4
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:21,974
Who'II voIunteer
to take care of the grub?

5
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,025
WeII, what the heck. I can do this.
Ernie Pantusso.

6
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:36,822
I did a pretty good job Iast year.
At Ieast no one compIained.

7
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:43,454
The entertainment committee.
Who wants to chair it?

8
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:51,962
WeII, entertainment goes
with food. Ernie Pantusso.

9
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:59,053
We'II need two captains for the softbaII
teams. Two. Come on. A show of hands.

10
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:07,353
WeII, I can handIe one team.
Ernie Pantusso.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,149
OK, so who wants the other? One more.

12
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:21,826
WeII, I'm going to be out there on
the fieId anyway, so... Ernie Pantusso.

13
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:26,205
Last but not Ieast, I need somebody
to head up transportation.

14
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:29,083
I got it. Ernie Pantusso.

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,756
The meeting of the committee chairmen
is at my house tonight at eight o'cIock.

16
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:39,468
PIease, everybody, try to be on time.

17
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:01,842
- Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm Iate.
- Where have you been?

18
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:07,639
I had to run a few errands. A funny
thing happened to me this afternoon.

19
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:12,394
On my way to ''Boston Magazine'' as one
of the city's 20 most eIigibIe bacheIors,

20
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,605
I saw a man waIking a dog.

21
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:20,652
The dog was not waIking Iike a dog. He
was waIking Iike a man, on his hind Iegs.

22
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,868
Where's a camera when you need one?
OK, enough jokes. Back to work.

23
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,956
20 most eIigibIe bacheIors?

24
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:36,877
- What's that?
- ''Boston Magazine''?

25
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,297
And you Iet them Iist you?

26
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:44,593
If I hadn't I wouId have missed
that funny dog.

27
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,554
You'II dine out on that story.

28
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:55,062
Why did you want them to Iist you? It's
for men seeking femaIe companionship.

29
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,276
No. Not entireIy.
Just good pubIicity for the bar, that's aII.

30
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:05,864
And it gave me a chance
to air my views on poIiticaI issues.

31
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:13,372
What poIiticaI issues
did you air views on?

32
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:17,751
I toId them I thought
nucIear war wouId be bad news.

33
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:25,092
Sam,
you've stirred up a hornet's nest there.

34
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,722
ReaIIy?
I can aIways say I was misquoted.

35
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:37,688
I see. ''EIigibIe bacheIors''
means eIigibIe for a brain transpIant.

36
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:42,568
I knew it. I knew you'd make
a big deaI out of this. Come on.

37
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:48,031
It was a nice IittIe articIe on my Iife,
my interests and a picture of me.

38
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:53,829
- It wasn't Iike it was cheesecake.
- No, Sam. With men, it's beefcake.

39
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,791
If I posed, it wouId be cheesecake.

40
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,878
If you posed, it wouId be crumb cake.

41
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:05,716
Sam, I'm very hurt by this.

42
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:10,596
Don't be. I'II teII you something
now to make you feeI better.

43
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:16,226
It was a surprise, but when I taIked to
my reporter, I said ''I may be a bacheIor,

44
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:22,608
''but it so happens I aIready found the
woman of my dreams: Diane Chambers.''

45
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:26,153
ReaIIy, Sam?

46
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:29,615
- That's very sweet.
- CaII and check.

47
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:35,787
- Her name's HeIen CasteIIa. Go on.
- I don't have to caII. I beIieve you.

48
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:40,417
I trust you.
I think that was a wonderfuI thing to do.

49
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,628
Me, too.

50
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,052
She bought that?

51
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:56,016
I'd Iike to seII her the oId North Church.

52
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,226
Good Iuck.

53
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,437
I owned that once.

54
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:06,902
It took me forever to unIoad it.

55
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,365
Boy, did I take a bath on that.

56
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:15,202
- I did it this time.
- What are you worried about?

57
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:22,209
She bought it. When it hits the stands,
teII her the reporter didn't mention it.

58
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,879
- FooIproof.
- At best, I'm just buying time.

59
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:32,344
She said she wouIdn't caII, but she'II caII.
There's a time when she wouIdn't have.

60
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:41,311
- Sam, you don't trust Diane much?
- I can't trust a thing that woman says.

61
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:47,818
Once trust goes out of a reIationship,
it's reaIIy no fun Iying to them any more.

62
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:57,744
It's not my fauIt.
She aIways starts things.

63
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:01,706
TeIIing me how to waIk,
how to act, how to think.

64
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:06,503
You've been doing those things
since you were what, 1 4?

65
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:15,387
I start doing things I don't want to do,
but knowing it'II tick her off, I do them.

66
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:20,183
The more it drives her crazy,
the happier I get. Is that weird?

67
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,394
No. We know the woman.

68
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,440
Sammy,
I think it's time for a romantic gesture.

69
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,695
- A trinket to smooth the water.
- I've done aII that.

70
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:37,284
It'II take more than music and a candIeIit
dinner to shut her up this time.

71
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,038
Sam, Iisten.
It's time for you to take a big step.

72
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:47,002
I wouIdn't say this ordinariIy
to anyone in a miIIion years.

73
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,339
But you know what might heIp?

74
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:56,011
If you actuaIIy
had physicaI reIations with her.

75
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:04,269
I don't think so. We'II wait untiI we're
sure how we feeI about each other.

76
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,941
You're a good oId-fashioned guy, Sam.

77
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:17,490
AII right. You wanna hear the most
romantic thing I heard a guy do?

78
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:21,328
WeII, I heard that SaIIy got mad at Burt

79
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:25,707
because she heard he was doing
another movie with Loni.

80
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:31,087
So Burt, to make up for it,
had someone paint a portrait of SaIIy.

81
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:35,884
Thank you very much
for that enIightenment.

82
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:39,763
We can knock it off
with the fan magazine driveI.

83
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:43,308
I read Burt and SaIIy
are headed for the aItar.

84
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:50,774
That's not a bad idea,
having a portrait done. She'd Iike that.

85
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,195
- RefiII, Sam.
- It shows some thinking. It's sensitive.

86
00:08:55,362 --> 00:09:02,452
The aItar? How can Burt do that, with the
terribIe secret he and Dinah stiII share?

87
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:09,542
Hey. Do you mind here? What kind of
artist shouId I get to paint Diane?

88
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,713
Get a bad one.
You don't want it to Iook Iike her.

89
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,593
Your wisecracks aII the time
don't make things any easier.

90
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,350
You know my phiIosophy. If you can't
say something nice, say it about Diane.

91
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:33,066
HeIp me out. Where do you go to find
an artist? Do you go to a store?

92
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:38,446
We're not taIking about TV dinners.
We're taIking about artists.

93
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:42,992
You gotta go where the artists are.
To an artist's pIace.

94
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,371
What's that secret
Burt and Dinah share?

95
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:52,335
I can't teII you. In a readers' poII,
I voted they shouId have more privacy.

96
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:58,174
Can I put this in check for a minute?

97
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:04,347
I happen to be a wonderfuI artist
and I'd just Iove to do a picture of Diane.

98
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:08,935
- I'd consider it a chaIIenge.
- You never toId me about this.

99
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:11,146
Sure. Let me show you.

100
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,567
Norm, just hoId it Iike that, pIease.

101
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:29,455
- Stinks.
- Yeah, it does.

102
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:34,836
I just remembered. It was my brother
that had the artistic taIent.

103
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:39,841
Now I remember. My taIent
is eating things that aren't food.

104
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,013
- Can we get back to artists?
- I deIiver maiI to one.

105
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,434
He's very successfuI
and I'II teII you how successfuI.

106
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:56,774
Yesterday he received a cheque for
$25,853 from a guy named Sweeney.

107
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,985
How do you know that?

108
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:03,948
When I put it in the sIot,
it passed in front of a 300-watt buIb.

109
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:06,826
Do you want me to get him in here?

110
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:10,914
I couId taIk to him.
Do you think he'd come down?

111
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,753
I'II give it a shot. I hesitate to use the
power vested in me by the Post Office

112
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,966
and the AImighty, but I'II make
an exception. You got a dime?

113
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:26,804
Wait a second. Maybe this whoIe thing's
about to bIow over.

114
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:36,356
- We've been very chiIdish in the past.
- We have?

115
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:39,817
Over things Iike this magazine articIe.

116
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:45,198
I was about to caII that reporter to check
your story, but I'm proud I didn't.

117
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:48,034
Me, too.

118
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:53,414
I know we're not perfect and we're going
through a difficuIt time,

119
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:58,419
but I just decided this is the perfect time
to start fresh.

120
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,839
Let's cIeanse our reIationship.

121
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:09,263
From this moment on, no more pettiness,
no more suspicion, no more dishonesty.

122
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,104
- You reaIIy mean this, don't you?
- I reaIIy do.

123
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:24,612
OK, Diane. I'm going to start being
honest with you right now.

124
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:30,785
You know I toId you I toId that reporter
about you? I didn't teII her anything.

125
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,331
- I see.
- I wish I had.

126
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:41,212
Thank you for respecting me enough
to teII the truth.

127
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:47,301
I'm gIad I didn't teII her. It wouId
have made me Iooked whipped.

128
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:52,056
If you want me to get on that teIephone
and teII her, I won't.

129
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:55,476
I was about to say I wouId, but I won't.

130
00:12:55,643 --> 00:13:01,023
The truth is that I Iike having
miIIions of women Iooking at my picture

131
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,234
and dreaming, ''I want him''.

132
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:06,195
This is me being honest with you here.

133
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,825
That's exactIy what I wanted.

134
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,454
This is great.
Why didn't we do this sooner?

135
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,333
- I don't know.
- You see, if you start teIIing the truth...

136
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:26,424
Sammy, I'II make that phone caII.

137
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:31,804
You kids just carry on
with what you're doing.

138
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:44,588
Someone put their names
on your picnic sheet.

139
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,673
No kidding. How many?

140
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,470
Three. We got Ziggy Stardust,
the Mad Hatter and CIark Kent.

141
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:55,390
Looks Iike I got myseIf an in-fieId.

142
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,936
Evening, everybody.

143
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:04,191
- How are you feeIing?
- Naked without my beer.

144
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:08,111
WaIked over here,
dragging my thirst behind me.

145
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,823
- So how was dinner?
- Listen up, everybody.

146
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:15,785
Stay away
from that Hungry Heifer pIace.

147
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:18,705
They've been advertising. No good?

148
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:24,878
AwfuI. They served a terribIe piece of
meat, tough potatoes, soggy vegetabIes.

149
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:28,673
- Why didn't you send it back?
- The service stinks.

150
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,553
By the time the waiter asked me
if it was OK, I was through.

151
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:45,232
- Can I help you?
- I have come to pander to the tastes of a tasteless.

152
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:51,029
You want to head the food committee.
A chairman for the food committee!

153
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:57,744
- ahh look ah, my buffaIo sunny-side up there, Chief.
- You referring to my appareI?

154
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:04,960
No offence there, LittIe Beaver,
but it is a tad out of the mundane.

155
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:08,046
Excuse me, but what is that outfit?

156
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:15,303
An Arapaho ceremoniaI tunic worn by the
viIIage eIders when they hoId counciI.

157
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,267
I earned it by Ietting them pierce
my fIesh with wiId turkey quiIIs.

158
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:25,689
This is a JC Penney wash and wear,
tapered taiIs.

159
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:30,568
The saIesman was nasty,
but I didn't have to go through that.

160
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:38,994
I'm Iooking for Sam MaIone. He's
interested in buying some of my work.

161
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,791
You must be PhiIIip Semenko.
I'm CIiff CIavin, your maiIman.

162
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,629
- We finaIIy meet face to face.
- I can die now.

163
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:56,136
Yeah. You've got a great wit about you.
Thanks for stopping by.

164
00:15:56,302 --> 00:16:00,306
- I don't Iike to be touched.
- I can grok that.

165
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:03,143
I don't Iike to be touched either.

166
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,939
I bet neither one of you
has to teII that to a Iot of peopIe.

167
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:15,071
Here's the connoisseur. Sam,
our artist friend Mr Semenko is here.

168
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:23,204
Hi, I'm Sam MaIone, Mr Cementma...
Samakama...

169
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:28,084
That waIking fire hydrant toId me
you were a man of inteIIigence.

170
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:33,798
- I see no evidence of that.
- Maybe he's exaggerating a IittIe bit.

171
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:38,136
I'm new to this art thing,
but I've heard good things about you.

172
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:43,433
You couId get me out of the dog house
by painting a picture of my girIfriend.

173
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:49,397
I don't care how you do this. Make it Iook
Iike her and have it here by tomorrow.

174
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:54,986
I got some snapshots I took
in the mountains.

175
00:16:55,153 --> 00:17:01,993
That's her on the Ieft. These were taken
in New Hampshire. We got a IittIe cabin.

176
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,166
I'm wearing the funny hat there
in that one. This one's pretty good.

177
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,337
It's shot up in the cabin.
You ever get up that way?

178
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:16,174
I guess not.

179
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,594
It is OK if you hoId these by the edges.

180
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,350
- Is there a probIem here?
- Your existence.

181
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,355
I was toId I was to meet a weaIthy
art investor who couId fiII my coffers.

182
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:33,358
No, I'm not above that yet.

183
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:39,239
Instead, I find myseIf facing
a nightmarish product

184
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:42,867
of our fIoundering educationaI system.

185
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:46,663
Hey, I don't have to take that. Do I?

186
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:55,004
- Let's just caII this whoIe thing off.
- You are an ignorant man. You aII are.

187
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:58,258
You are aII stuff to fiII graves.

188
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:02,637
Don't forget to teII your friends
about Cheers?

189
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:06,182
Don't feeI too bad.
I feeI I'm partIy to bIame.

190
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,393
Let's taIk, CIiff.

191
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:14,482
HeIIo, everyone. I'm back.

192
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,195
I'm sorry I stormed off Iike that.

193
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:27,954
I've cooIed off. Coach, CarIa,
everybody, Iet's just continue.

194
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,543
It's important you know
I wasn't reaIIy trying to kiII Sam

195
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,587
when I wrapped the teIephone cord...

196
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:42,969
- May I heIp you?
- That's the face I've been Iooking for.

197
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:45,513
Sorry, I'm stiII using it.

198
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:51,269
I couId Iet you visit it on weekends.

199
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,692
- Two draughts, Coach.
- Coming up.

200
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,053
What?

201
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,183
- What do you want from me?
- I'm PhiIIip Semenko.

202
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:33,144
I want to paint you.

203
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,732
PhiIIip Semenko, the genius?

204
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:41,235
That's redundant.

205
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:45,573
I've seen your work and you're briIIiant.

206
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,953
And I Iove this Arapaho ceremoniaI tunic.

207
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,542
What are you doing here?

208
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,963
Up to now, fondIy remembering
my bout with jaundice.

209
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,801
Then I saw you.
I want you to be my next subject.

210
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:09,639
You're kidding. Me? Why?

211
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:19,440
You have an ancient souI and it's
suffering more than it ever has before.

212
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:23,069
Suffering?

213
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:29,742
Your spirit is imprisoned, trapped.
Stretched on a rack.

214
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:37,416
Your eyes have the Iook
of a strangIing sparrow.

215
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:46,217
WeII, that's in this year.
Last year it was bangs.

216
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,054
Hey, Tonto. I toId you to beat it.

217
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:56,018
- Something important is happening.
- You're Ieaving. The deaI's off. Beat it.

218
00:20:56,185 --> 00:21:03,025
You have nothing to do with this! How
dare you interrupt the artistic process?

219
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:06,362
That's how I get my kicks.
Now, vamoose.

220
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:11,993
Stop. This is PhiIIip Semenko,
the genius. He wants to paint me.

221
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,162
I've never been so excited in my Iife.

222
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,457
- You heard of this cIown?
- Of course.

223
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:24,630
He's the country's most promising young
artists. Some day he couId be great.

224
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:29,051
Come on. If he's a great artist,
what's he doing aIive?

225
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,266
Sam, wiII you stop?
This is the chance of a Iifetime.

226
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:38,936
Can't you see
how fascinated he is by me?

227
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:42,690
I must start our sessions tomorrow.
Maybe now.

228
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:46,277
Wait a minute.
Don't you see what's going on?

229
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:49,822
He'II invite you to his pIace,
get you nuded up.

230
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,450
That happens to be my territory.

231
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:58,664
Sam, don't be siIIy.
Of course he wouIdn't want me nude.

232
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:05,254
Even if he did, I'd do it. He is briIIiant.
You don't want me in the nude, do you?

233
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:11,761
I'm open-minded about that sort of thing.
It's just there are so many coIds around.

234
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:16,766
I paint the souI, not the body.
To me, every souI is naked.

235
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:19,393
The weirdo waIks.

236
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,692
Sam, I want him to paint me.
I can't Iet an opportunity Iike this pass.

237
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:30,112
Honey, I don't Iike him.

238
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,535
You do anything with him, go anywhere,
share a bus with him and we're through.

239
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,788
I have spoken.

240
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:44,335
- Fine.
- What?

241
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:50,549
I said fine. Whatever you want. I see
how strongIy you feeI about it, so fine.

242
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:54,845
Yeah? In that case,
I got something eIse to teII you.

243
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:58,015
And as soon as I think of it, I wiII.

244
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,069
I can onIy imagine
the heII you've endured.

245
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:14,490
- It hasn't been easy.
- WeII, goodbye.

246
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:21,288
Wait. I reaIIy want you to paint me.

247
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:24,875
What about that maIignant growth
you caII a boyfriend?

248
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,383
Give him time to cooI down. Once he
sees the finished work, he'II forgive me.

249
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:38,889
- He'II forgive you and forgive everything.
- He'II hate it and hate you for doing it.

250
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:42,768
If you pose for me, it'II drive a wedge
between you and him.

251
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:47,106
So you won't do it?

252
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:49,650
I'II do it for free.

253
00:23:54,989 --> 00:24:00,494
Hey, Iisten up, everybody. I'm sorry
about coming on strong Iike that.

254
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:05,374
It seems unprofessionaI,
but roughhouse is the onIy Ianguage

255
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,211
some peopIe understand
and I know how to speak it.

256
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,092
Thanks for your attention. Go back and
have some fun there. Where's Diane?

257
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,262
TO BE CONTINUED...
