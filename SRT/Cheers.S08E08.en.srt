00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,838
Hey, everybody!

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,307
My grandmother                 
 cleaned out her attic.         
 Guess what she found?

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,759
Your grandfather?

5
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:14,295
No. He doesn't go              
 in the attic.

6
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:18,683
It's a memory quilt         
    that all the women

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,686
in my family made for me    
    when i graduated from       
    high school.

8
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:23,270
Yeah, i've heard about         
 these things.

9
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:24,806
Lots of women get together

10
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:26,541
and embroider patches          
 that illustrate                
 the happy memories

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,326
of a young man's life.

12
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:30,745
So these women were, what, 
     authentic folk artists     
     then, huh?

13
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,514
No, just bored housewives.

14
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,282
Hey, check this out.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,618
See this soft little           
 square here?                   
             Yeah.

16
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:40,538
This is a piece of             
 my very first baby blanket.

17
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:43,274
Now, uh, what do those 
         little dots signify?

18
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:46,845
Well, that represents       
    my very first childhood     
    disease, smallpox.

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,447
I almost died.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,735
Well, what's that, uh,      
    long green thing there?

21
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:57,338
Oh, uh, this is                
 the beanstalk from             
 my first high school play.

22
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,957
I fell off of it               
 in the first act,

23
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,409
cracked 2 ribs                 
 and punctured a lung.

24
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,612
I almost died.

25
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,983
Oh, this red patch here    
     represents the big fire

26
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,302
that burned down my house      
 when i was 6.

27
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,205
And what, you almost died?

28
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,225
No, i got out.

29
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:19,527
But while i was running away,  
 i fell in this well,

30
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:21,963
right here and i almost...

31
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:24,549

 i'm very particular

00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,727
Right about here, you say?

55
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,563
Uh, not that i'm questioning   
 you, or anything sweetheart,

56
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,981
but what are we    
             signing here?

57
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:05,149
Well, you now,              
    when eddie passed away, uh,

58
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,351
i wanted to do something    
    special for him so

59
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,321
i started this petition     
    to get the bruins           
    to retire his number,

60
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,257
kind of like a memorial.

61
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,843
Yeah, that will show him   
     that people of boston      
     won't forget old--

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,879
old-- what the hell's  
         his number?

63
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,014
38.                
             38. Oh, no, no.

64
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,150
No, no, 38 will not work.

65
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:24,785
That's like the most popular   
 guy on the team, one of        
 the top scorers.

66
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,620
Is he dead?

67
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,723
All right, eddie's got him 
     there, i guess.

68
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,124
Don't you forget it.

69
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,961
All right i got to get 
         more names, everybody!

70
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,413
You guys over here,         
    you want to sign a petition

71
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,915
to commemorate eddie lebec?

72
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,215
Oh, sure.

73
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,685
Well deserved, 
                 too.           
             Thank you.

74
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,954
At least somebody around here  
 has some respect.

75
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,657
Who's eddie lebec?             
                You remember.

76
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,692
He's that cartoon skunk.

77
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:52,664
Who always--always 
             fell in love       
             with black cats

78
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,166
that had crawled under  
        freshly painted fences.

79
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,468
Oh, yeah.

80
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:57,969
Is he dead?

81
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,438
Yeah, just sign.

82
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,011
[Mumbling]

83
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,013
why...

84
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,266
why me?

85
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,285
You want to talk about it,     
 or do you want to whine?

86
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:16,621
I guess i want to  
             talk about it.

87
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,591
No, no. We can't do both.

88
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:23,060
Corporate wants me to      
     throw some idiotic, stupid 
     retirement party

89
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,897
for some insignificant         
 middle-management nobody.

90
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,749
You're retiring?   
             Congratulations!

91
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:32,554
I wish. You know,              
 i thought i was through        
 with this sort of crap.

92
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,505
Corporate hasn't               
 bothered me for months now.

93
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:38,743
In fact, i haven't even    
     heard from those people    
     in i don't know how long.

94
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,578
Hey.

95
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,780
Wait a minute.

96
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,950
You don't think             
    they have somebody else     
    doing this stuff, do you?

97
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:50,120
[Gasps]                     
    who's moving in on my turf?

98
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:52,239
I'm gonna make         
         a few calls.

99
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,593
Hello, everyone.

100
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,662
It's cranes  <i>a trois.</i>

101
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,166
Look who's making              
 his first trip to the big bar.

102
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,634
Ooh, show everybody            
 his little fake i.D., Hon.

103
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,370
Frasier, please.

104
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,439
Oh, i'm just having            
 a little fun.

105
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,892
You know, i've tapped          
 into a whole new vein of       
 humor with this baby thing.

106
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,512
For example, how many babies   
 does it take to change         
 a light bulb?

107
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,563
Answer: none!

108
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:20,134
Babies don't have the motor    
 skills or the depth perception 
 to change a light bulb.

109
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,137
That one does get me.

110
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:28,426
He looks so different          
 than he did in the hospital.

111
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:31,178
Yes, i know. You know          
 the days flee so quickly.

112
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:34,248
If only we had had             
 the foresight to capture those 
 early days of innocence,

113
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,750
but now, they're gone forever.

114
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,886
How old is he now?             
                 About a week.

115
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:43,190
Say, did his bellybutton   
     fall off yet?

116
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,777
Any day now.

117
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:47,812
What, what do you mean?

118
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,480
Well, you see,                 
 when the umbilical cord        
 is severed,

119
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,901
the remaining umbilicus        
 stays attached to the naval    
 for several days,

120
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,886
during which time              
 it, uh, comes to resemble

121
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:58,322
a sort of shriveled,           
 week-old banana.

122
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:01,675
Hey, you know, it's very funny 
 you use that analogy           
 because the, uh,

123
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:05,913
human umbilical cord        
    if memory serves            
    is 90% potassium.

124
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,254
Stay away from the baby,       
 will you, cliff?

125
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:23,848
You got a name          
        for him yet?

126
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,567
Frederick.     
 Hey, all right!

127
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,953
Fred freddy,           
         the fredder man!

128
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,422
Frederick.

129
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:36,277
That, uh,           
            that's quite a rig  
            you got there.

130
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:38,263
Isn't it marvelous?

131
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,632
This is a native  <i>rebozo</i>   
    <i> used by the peasant women</i>  
    <i> of mexico</i>

132
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,936
to keep the baby close         
 and warm and enable it to feel 
 the mother's heartbeat.

133
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,021
How much does something    
     like that run you?

134
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:49,523
Oh, just a few paltry  
         pesos in mexico.

135
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:52,459
Or $144 at saks.

136
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,363
Well, daddy, we should run     
 if we want to pick up

137
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,449
those deli platters            
 before the party.              
        Right.

138
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,835
You are all coming          
    to the  <i>bris</i>                
    <i>this afternoon, aren't you?</i>

139
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:03,471
Oh, you bet, we wouldn't       
 miss that  <i>bris</i> deal           
 for anything.

140
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,473
You know, i can't tell you     
 how much it means to us.

141
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,209
As you all know, i was raised  
 without a religious tradition,

142
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,095
and i'm determined my son      
 shall not be                   
 similarly deprived.

143
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:12,964
I'm so grateful to lilith      
 and her jewish faith

144
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,701
for providing frederick        
 a heritage of spirituality.

145
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,436
You know,                      
 and the ceremony promises      
 to be quite enlightening, too.

146
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:22,339
I mean, after all              
 it's not everyday              
 you're ritually circumcised.

147
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,774
What?

148
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,692
Well, that's what      
         a  <i>bris</i> is.

149
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,896
Yes. It's the religious        
 ceremony where the--the        
 baby is circumcised.

150
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:30,464
Oh, the baby!

151
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:46,314
Look, eddie wasn't just        
 any hockey player.             
 He was a legend.

152
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,733
He represents              
     the little people.

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,801
It's the least you can do!

154
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,203
Ok, fine!

155
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,307
Boy, one of these days         
 i'm gonna kill my mother.

156
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,728
Hey, are those losers      
     from corporate here yet?

157
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:01,995
Just you.

158
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,232
What is that?

159
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,035
Oh, i needed some              
 refreshments for               
 the retirement party, so,

160
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,821
i got this day-old platter     
 of seafood from melville's.

161
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,425
Oh, the shrimp     
             is slithering off  
             the toothpicks.

162
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:17,211
[Groans]    
 well, don't just stand there.  
 Get me a hot glue gun.

163
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:23,117
Sam, what are you doing        
 back? I thought you were going 
 to the baby's  <i>bris.</i>

164
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:24,852
Well, i wanted to.

165
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,989
You ever try to find a date    
 for one of those things?

166
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:32,543
Don't you think that frasier   
 and lilith are gonna be        
 insulted if you're not there?

167
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,196
Oh, you know what a mob scene  
 those circumcisions are.

168
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,685
They're not gonna miss     
     one little person.

169
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:44,421
Hey, wait a minute, man.   
     What are you doing here?

170
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,057
I was gonna go,

171
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,826
but i didn't-- you know,   
     the thought of renting     
     a tuxedo and everything...

172
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:52,263
it wasn't formal. You didn't   
 need to rent a tuxedo.         
                 No?

173
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,932
Great, then i can afford   
     a few more rounds.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,285
You know, you guys,            
 this is a very                 
 important occasion

175
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,388
for the cranes.                
 Somebody should go there       
 from cheers.

176
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,689
Why aren't you there?

177
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,290
I have a perfect excuse.

178
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,476
I have to entertain            
 a bunch of deadheads.

179
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,579
Well, we're here.      
         Start, uh, juggling.

180
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,302
Uh, we're here for     
         my retirement party.

181
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,105
Oh, yes, yes, yes,             
 everything's set up            
 in the back.

182
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,958
Come on.

183
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,209
Come on.                   
     Shake 'em, don't dawdle.

184
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,530
I don't see why                
 i have to retire, i'm only 65.

185
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,067
I've got 10 or 15 more         
 good years in me.

186
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,569
The seafood will               
 take care of that.

187
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:38,092
Hey. Sam and mr. Peterson  
     are here.

188
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,478
[Exclaims]                 
     you didn't go either?

189
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,713
Well, it's not our fault.      
 I mean...

190
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:46,918
we looked and looked           
 for a place to park.           
 Just couldn't find one.

191
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,636
Maybe we should have    
        looked near their house

192
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,439
instead of just around 
         the ball park.

193
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,124
So you guys all                
 chickened out, huh?

194
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,626
Carla, you're a woman. 
         You couldn't           
         possibly understand.

195
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:58,395
What, you're a bunch of        
 wussy wimps

196
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,531
who couldn't even              
 go to a religious ceremony

197
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:03,100
that involved a little pain    
 that wasn't even your own?

198
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,169
Oh, then you    
                do understand.

199
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:08,306
Uh, yeah,                      
 this is nothing anyway.

200
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,441
The original rites             
 of passage, uh, started

201
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,960
with the jungle tribes         
 down in borneo.

202
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,246
Yeah?          
 When young jungle              
 tribal lad

203
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:18,449
was, uh, on the brink          
 of puberty, they'd bring him   
 forward and, uh,

204
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,419
take out this large,           
 sharpened clamshell--

205
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,970
oh, no, no. Don't tell me.

206
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:26,307
They would, uh, fill it        
 with dip, pass it around       
 with the hors d'oeuvres.

207
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:29,744
Oh.                
 Then they'd take               
 these 2 big jagged rocks...

208
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:31,645
no, cliff, cliff,      
         cliff, cliff.

209
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:33,931
...bang them together          
 to call the tribes             
 out of the hills.

210
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,434
You know, then the, uh,        
 witchdoctor stepped up

211
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,870
with this long,                
 sharpened bamboo staff...

212
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:41,305
oh, here it comes.

213
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,574
...shoved it into the ground   
 and hung a flag on it.

214
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:47,361
Then they danced around it     
 pretty much till               
 they dropped really.

215
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:50,598
Wait. W-w-when do they     
     circumcise the kid?

216
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,116
What do you mean,           
    circumcise?

217
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,885
There are no jews              
 in borneo, you  <i>mulyak.</i>

218
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,599
I don't know       
             about you guys...

219
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,835
i feel ashamed.                
 I mean, lilith and frasier     
 are our friends, you know?

220
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,420
We should be there.

221
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:14,788
Sammy's right.

222
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:17,291
There are times            
     when a man has to stand up 
     and be counted.

223
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:20,561
Now, they will have        
     those really big pickles,  
     won't they?

224
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,380
Yeah, you're right.        
     I'm with you, sammy.

225
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:24,415
Besides, you know,             
 frasier's our pal.

226
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,784
You know, if he's man          
 enough to do this,             
 then we should be.

227
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,135
There you go.               
 Come on.

228
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,856
The  <i>bris</i> is off.              
 I've kidnapped my son.

229
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,920
You kidnapped him?     
         What about the  <i>bris?</i>

230
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,539
Sam, i just couldn't        
    go through with it.

231
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,076
I mean, i-- you know,          
 i tried to. Tradition          
 and lilith and all that,

232
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,812
but, my god, i'm the--         
 i'm the boy's father.          
 And that guy was

233
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,281
about to give my son           
 one hell of a boo-boo.

234
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,304
I assure you, frederick,

235
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:07,457
this won't happen          
     every time we have         
     people over to the house.

236
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,026
What, uh,

237
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,629
so what did the little woman   
 have to say about all this?

238
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,613
Oh, my god, lilith.

239
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:17,318
You know, i never looked back  
 after i elbowed her into       
 the chopped liver.

240
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:20,654
Frasier, as a married man, 
     i think i can give you     
     some advice.

241
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,674
You go back, you talk to her,  
 you iron this out.

242
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,311
What's the worst            
    that could happen?          
    I mean, she can't kill you.

243
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,464
You were dead          
         the moment you said,   
         "i do."

244
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,216
You're right.              
     I should go back.

245
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,067
But i'd be so embarrassed.

246
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:35,769
I mean, how can you go back    
 to a roomful of people

247
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,956
that think you're           
    a total idiot? I mean,      
    how do you do it, cliff?

248
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:43,911
Well, i don't really           
 like to divulge...

249
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:46,180
hey!

250
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,584
Come here, come here,          
 listen, listen,                
 i know what you'd tell me

251
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:53,270
in a situation like this.  
     First you'd say            
     lots of gobbledygook

252
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,272
that no one could understand   
 but then you'd

253
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,658
get me to go back there 
        and face the music.

254
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:59,410
Admit the truth.

255
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,145
Well, you're right, sam.

256
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,814
Confronting one's fears        
 is 1 of 5 ways                 
 to resolve an inner conflict.

257
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:07,435
Of course                      
 the other 4 being--            
 god, aren't i pompous ass?

258
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,486
No, you're not pompous.

259
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:12,423
Listen,                
         i'll tell you what,

260
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,191
we're all gonna go back 
        there with you.

261
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,376
All right.  
     Really?

262
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,510
You're gonna go with me?

263
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,613
You bet.                
 Oh, great. You know,

264
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,215
you're right, guys.            
 I was kind of panicked there   
 for a few minutes,

265
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:25,286
but i'm ready to atone now,    
 and start behaving like        
 a rational and good parent.

266
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,487
Oops.

267
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,589
I guess we're gonna need you.

268
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,848
Carla, how's your              
 petition coming?

269
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,284
Well, it was            
        a little slow at first,

270
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,038
but since i started            
 forging people's signatures,   
 it's gone a lot faster.

271
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,675
That's nice. You know,         
 i never did sign that.

272
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:48,909
Oh, yeah, you did.

273
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,428
Really?

274
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,364
I worked you in right here 
     between tom cruise         
     and mel gibson.

275
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,450
Ooh, forge me again.

276
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,889
How's it going, larry?

277
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:05,743
Have you ever been roasted     
 by 7 people you don't know?

278
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,145
All those funny,   
             insulting toasts.

279
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,648
I came out to prepare  
         my hilarious rebuttal.

280
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:13,450
So far, all i can  
             think of is,

281
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,470
"shut up. You're hurting   
     my feelings."

282
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,055
[Laughing]

283
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,426
i got a grange reunion 
         coming up.

284
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,611
Can i steal that?

285
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,048
Maybe i ought to           
     just--just moon them all

286
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,983
and be done with it.

287
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,318
No, i'd better not.

288
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:34,455
25 years of sitting 
            behind a desk       
            for that company,

289
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,158
i have a pretty            
     sorry excuse for a butt.

290
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,147
Well, you know, if you need    
 anything else, just holler.

291
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,450
What a loser.

292
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:50,521
He's not kidding               
 about that butt, either.

293
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:54,642
Well, i feel sorry             
 for that guy.

294
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,944
This is probably one of        
 the last parties               
 he'll ever have,

295
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:59,964
and he doesn't look like       
 he's having a very good time.

296
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,448
You know, maybe we should      
 liven it up.

297
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,050
I'm great at parties.

298
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,320
Back in hanover,               
 i invented the game            
 "hide bob's pants."

299
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:11,092
Boy, everyone               
    loved that game.

300
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,843
Well, except for bob.

301
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,817
Hello, everyone.

302
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,737
Hi, frasier.                
    You through with the  <i>bris?</i>

303
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,438
Yes, yes, yes.

304
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:28,008
My son is happy, healthy,      
 and nowhere in the vicinity    
 of this bar.

305
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,509
Ouch!

306
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:32,045
Say, uh, just out of        
    curiosity, you know,

307
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,814
is anybody in the bar      
     happen to be lactating

308
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,634
and in need of some        
     quick cash?

309
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,819
Well, if so, just, uh, meet me 
 in the office.

310
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,654
Ouch! Damn it, frederick,

311
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,990
give it up.                    
 It's just not gonna happen.

312
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,844
You know what?

313
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,747
I think he's got the baby  
     under that coat.

314
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:56,970
How did you know that,         
 woody?

315
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,157
Oh, it's the same   
            basic premise as    
            "hide bob's pants."

316
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,450
Oh, my god,                    
 it's mr. Sheridan.

317
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,518
What is he doing here?

318
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:12,986
Who's he,          
             another deadhead?

319
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:14,888
No. He's the executive         
 vice president

320
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:18,259
in charge of east coast     
    marketing, research,        
    and sales.

321
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,793
He's the what?

322
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,712
He's the head deadhead.

323
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,350
Mr. Sheridan,              
     what a surprise!

324
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,018
Miss howe,                     
 you're looking very well.

325
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:30,203
Thank you and to what do i 
     owe this honor?

326
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:32,389
Well, i'm here                 
 for larry's party.

327
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,257
You know larry?

328
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,694
Oh, yes, he's                  
 a dear old friend              
 and my wife's younger brother.

329
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,429
Is your wife coming?

330
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,865
No. I'm afraid                 
 she's passed away.

331
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,233
Oh, then you're stag?

332
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:49,823
Uh, i--i didn't expect to      
 see you at this party, sir.

333
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,742
Oh, i remember what            
 wonderful shindigs             
 you throw.

334
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,547
As a matter of fact,           
 i recommended you              
 for larry's farewell.

335
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,650
I can't wait to see            
 what fun and excitement        
 you've planned.

336
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:02,519
You know, actually, uh,        
 the real surprises             
 haven't come yet.

337
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,104
Oh, good, then i haven't   
     missed anything.

338
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,989
That's safe to say.

339
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,909
Now those pants            
     i could hide.

340
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,148
Now i have to plan something   
 exciting for these people!

341
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,067
Frasier?

342
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,734
Frasier?                
             Wh-where is he?

343
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,470
Where's my husband?        
     Where's my baby?

344
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,205
Where's my beer?

345
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,857
They're in the office.

346
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,459
Dr. Levinson, friends,

347
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,194
please, just have a seat.

348
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:30,063
I'll just be a minute      
     while i reason with him.

349
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:33,834
Wife to husband.           
     Scientist to scientist.

350
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,837
Frasier, have you gone     
     completely  <i>meshugana?</i>

351
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,091
Sam, this is terrible.

352
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:42,659
What?

353
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,445
Mr. Sheridan,                  
 the vice president is here and 
 he expects a terrific party.

354
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:48,382
Now i've got to think          
 of something,                  
 think of something fantastic.

355
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:49,683
What do you think?

356
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:51,886
It's your party.           
     Y-you think of something.

357
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,521
Yeah, right.                   
 What do you want me to do?

358
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,857
Go back there, strip naked,    
 and gyrate to                  
  <i>funky cold medina?</i>

359
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,128
We could help you rehearse  
    if you want.

360
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:04,297
I'm being nuts. I gotta think  
 of something classy.

361
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:08,035
Yeah, i'll tell you what       
 the sox did at our reunion     
 we had once.

362
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:09,787
Didn't hurt a bit.             
     What was that?

363
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,089
Wet t-shirt contest.       
         Excuse me?

364
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,210
All right, it wasn't           
 a contest, it was fixed,       
 but we still had a lot of fun.

365
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,795
You know, you don't    
         just rustle up         
         a wet t-shirt contest

366
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,330
at the drop of a hat.

367
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,549
Sure you do. It's just like    
 ordering a pizza.

368
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:25,118
As a matter of fact,           
 i think i have                 
 the 800 number here.

369
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,488
Here you go.

370
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:30,624
"Fulfilling your   
             wet t-shirt needs  
             since 1988."

371
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,295
No, sam, i'm not gonna 
         let you call

372
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:35,862
and arrange            
         a wet t-shirt contest.

373
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,298
It exploits women.

374
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,999
What, you got a better idea?

375
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,035
I'll call.

376
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:42,836
What about                  
    exploiting women?

377
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,172
Well, you know,        
         when a man does it,    
         it's exploitation.

378
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,741
When a woman does it,  
         it's good business.

379
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:48,775
Hi!

380
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:50,977
Is this jiggly party queens?

381
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:02,155
Well, frasier,                 
 you've been in there quite     
 a while. How's it going?

382
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,924
Well, it shouldn't be  
         much longer.

383
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:06,177
It's almost        
             my turn to talk.

384
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,197
So how do you think            
 the party's going?

385
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,881
It's terrific.

386
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:14,501
You know, if those kittens 
     with their cropped tops    
     and seltzer bottles

387
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:16,603
can't liven things up, 
         then darn it,

388
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,574
men aren't just as depraved 
    as i thought they were.

389
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,892
How's it going? Are the girls  
 cheering him up?

390
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,712
Well, no. Actually, the girls  
 are depressed now, too.

391
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,867
Boy, i'll tell you,            
 nothing can bring down         
 a party faster

392
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:33,003
than a wet girl                
 telling sad stories.

393
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,039
Great. My career is over.

394
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:39,443
Yeah, i wanted to              
 put my arm around her          
 and comfort her,

395
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,179
but she told me                
 it would me cost $10.

396
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,215
It made me ashamed             
 to be a man.

397
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,383
Anybody, uh, got change        
 for a $50?

398
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:50,804
All right, let's get this   
     <i>bris</i> show on the road.     
    Chop, chop.

399
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:54,424
Ooh, sorry.                
     Wrong choice of words.

400
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,428
Rebecca, would you object  
     if we used your poolroom?

401
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,595
Why not?

402
00:19:58,663 --> 00:19:59,830
The party's dead.

403
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,531
My career is dead.

404
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,134
I'm thinking of letting woody  
 hide my pants.

405
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,104
Thank you.

406
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,974
You can, uh, you can actually  
 do a  <i>bris</i> in a bar?

407
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:14,144
Oh, yes, i've performed        
 the ceremony in many places.

408
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,113
Granted, a bar's    
            a little irregular,

409
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,382
but, uh, i must say,       
     it's a lot cheerier than   
     the bernsteins' rec room.

410
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,219
May i ask what, uh, changed 
    your mind?

411
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,238
Well, frasier and i 
            had a long talk,

412
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,974
and we both agree that 
         frederick would have   
         the same experience

413
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:30,377
even if the circumcision    
    took place in the hospital,

414
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,412
the only difference being  
     we wouldn't have to

415
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,214
go through the trauma  
         of seeing it happen.

416
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:37,050
Now we realize  
                that's selfish.

417
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:38,618
It'll be much easier   
         on frederick

418
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,321
if we're here to           
     comfort and support him.

419
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,757
Therefore, we've decided to    
 go through with the ceremony.

420
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,493
Don't touch my baby!

421
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,879
Got that out of my system.     
 Now we can proceed.

422
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,370
Great. I did it!

423
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,571
Eddie's gonna be honored       
 after all.

424
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:01,641
Oh, terrific. So the bruins 
    are retiring his number?

425
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,077
No, no, the bruins             
 convinced me that

426
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:07,381
eddie wasn't                   
 a good enough player           
 for that kind of an honor.

427
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:10,283
But they offered me            
 season tickets

428
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:15,155
if i leave them alone,         
 which was pretty much what i   
 was after in the first place.

429
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,689
Yeah, wait till             
    i tell the kids.

430
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,758
Maybe now                      
 they'll respect him.

431
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:24,330
Miss howe,             
         may i see you, please?

432
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,465
Yes.

433
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,335
Miss howe,

434
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,438
that was the strangest         
 get-together

435
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,306
i've ever attended.

436
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:36,376
I am so sorry, sir.

437
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:39,012
Ordinarily,                    
 i'd be very upset, but it--

438
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,948
it all seems to have           
 worked out fairly well.

439
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,617
It did?     
         Yes.

440
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,385
My brother-in-law, larry,

441
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:47,404
is finally                     
 going to leave my house.

442
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,973
I'm going to have      
         a hot pink wedding.

443
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,593
Boy, it'll be good not having  
 that sorry butt                
 around the house anymore.

444
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,633
Norm, i'm glad              
    we went to the ceremony.

445
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,102
Me, too, cliffie.              
 I'm kind of proud of myself,   
 you know?

446
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,071
Figure if i could      
         eat through that,

447
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,473
i could eat        
             through anything.

448
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,710
It's ok, baby.

449
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,978
[Baby whimpering]       
 everything will be fine.

450
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:13,997
(Frasier)              
         it's ok, baby.

451
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:16,116
Everything will be fine.

452
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:17,618
Say, you know,

453
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,986
[whimpering]       
 what do you say next time      
 we have a girl?

454
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:26,743
