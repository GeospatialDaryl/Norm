00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:07,304
So, what's this, uh, play       
    you tried out for?          

127
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,805
     Well, it's a brand-new one.

128
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,406
    It's called <i>Authors in Hell.</i>

129
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,408
              I'm hoping to play
              either Mark Twain,

130
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:15,045
        one of the guys from the
        Algonquin Round Table   

131
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,479
                or Satan.       

132
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:19,716
                But heck, I'd   
                be just as happy

133
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,218
              playing a fire-   
              breathing incubus.

134
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:23,320
        They get to stay onstage
        the whole four hours.   

135
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,592
 Hey, hey, that's my director,  
          Grif Palmer.          

136
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:31,161
                 This must mean 
                 I got the part.

137
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:32,896
        Or that he's thirsty.   

138
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:35,665
        Hi, Mr. Palmer.         

139
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,968
          Can I get you a drink?

140
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,035
    No, thanks.                 

141
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,170
                 I got the part!

142
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:45,308
Woody, you're                   
a multitalented young man.      

143
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,910
          I didn't get the part?

144
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,466
        Well, you know, I've    
        tried out so many times,

145
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,068
                  and I've never
                  gotten a part.

146
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,604
         Maybe I'm just wasting 
         my time in the theater.

147
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,806
Come on, Woody,                 
don't give up so easily.        

148
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,975
Once upon a time,               
there was a young man           

149
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,645
named Grif Palmer               
who also auditioned             

150
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:07,114
for many a role                 
that he didn't get.             

151
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,448
                  As many as me?

152
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,283
    Well, no.                   

153
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,687
Wait, wait,                     
I've got a thought.             

154
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,989
What would you say              
if I told you                   

155
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:18,191
I've selected                   
a fresh, new face               

156
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:20,861
to understudy the role          
of Mark Twain?                  

157
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:23,329
I think                         
you'll be hearing his name      

158
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:27,134
quite a bit from now on...      
Mr. Woody Boyd.                 

159
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:28,135
                 Hey, that's me!

160
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,302
        Hey, everybody,         

161
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,603
I'm going                       
to be an understudy!            

162
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:31,805
                 Hey, all right.

163
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,839
                NORM:           
                All right, Wood.

164
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:34,173
    That's good.                

165
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,308
Woody, this isn't going         
to interfere                    

166
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,509
with your job, is it?           

167
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:39,146
     Gee, I don't think so.     

168
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,549
    Well... yeah.               

169
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,919
I'm sorry, Woody,               
I need you here nights.         

170
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,488
        Miss Howe,              
this is my golden chance.       

171
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:49,823
    I have to do this.          

172
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,191
     Don't you understand,      
      I just gotta do it!       

173
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:54,728
         I just gotta!          

174
00:06:59,033 --> 00:06:59,816
      That was really good, man.

175
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,917
             Can I talk to you  
             just a second here?

176
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:04,387
                  Let him do it.

177
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:06,423
I would love to,                
but I need him here.            

178
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:07,557
            Well, he'll be here.

179
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:08,991
    You saw that performance.   

180
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:10,993
            They're not going   
            to let him go on.   

181
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:14,597
Break a leg, Woody.             

182
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,666
        All right!              

183
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,368
Welcome to the theater,         
Woody.

and the Oliviers.               

185
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:22,605
To a profession

To a calling                    
I only hope                     

188
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:30,213
will bring you as much joy      
as it has brought me.

190
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:36,252
     You know Grif Palmer?      

191
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,322
     Yeah. He's the janitor     
      at my kids' school.       

192
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:51,535

                    Woody,

                  you have been 
                  coming in here

199
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:08,418
                dressed in that 
                ridiculous getup
                for three weeks.

200
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,753
         Now, when are you going
         to stop this nonsense? 

201
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:13,323

203
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,861
Putting on makeup like this     
can take hours.                 

204
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,897
But I wouldn't expect you       
to understand.                  

205
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,500

             in the <i>theater?</i>    

206
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,201
No, because                     
you don't wear makeup.

run upstairs

Isn't it enough the cabdriver   
already took a swing at you?

    You guys look like          
      you had a good time.      

371

We had oodles of fun.           

372
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:32,077
And we lost a combined          
11 pounds to boot.              

373
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,613

             weight on a cruise?

00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:35,548
             I heard there were 
             wall-to-wall meals.

375
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,684
             There were also    
             wall-to-wall waves.

376
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,752
    Yes.

little, uh, ear patches.

They seemed to do the trick.    

382
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:52,131
      And put us to sleep       
for the rest of the trip.

                 more refreshed.

a glass or something.

                    Please, Sam,

492

                 I can't do     
                 this by myself.

493
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:58,777
          You've got to help me.

494
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,012
All right, all right.           

495
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,947
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.           
                    Thank you.  

496
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,250
          You believe           
    I'm just an understudy?     

497
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,107
                Um, Mary,       
        Yes.                    

498

         you something.         

499

          Well, um...           

500
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,565
        Mary, you see...        

501
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,466
             Uh...              

502
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,153
I mean, you know,               
uh, how...                      

503
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:26,222
    I don't suppose there's     
any chance you understand       

504
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,923
  what I'm talking about yet.   

505
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:30,075
                 Actually, I do.

506
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,046
        Let me explain something
        to you, Woody.          

507
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,451
        I'm a very lonely woman 
        since I lost my husband.

508
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,686
                 My family lives
                 out of state.  

509
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,772
                  I never see my
                  grandchildren,

510
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,440
          and most of my friends

511
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:46,375
                have moved or   
                passed away.    

512
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,712
            Seems my days are   
            so hard to fill.    

513
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,714
                  I swear, there
                  are mornings  

514
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:54,483
             when it didn't     
             seem worthwhile    
             getting out of bed.

515
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:57,086
         A-And then I met you...
Stop. Stop.                     

516
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,620
Will you marry me?              

517
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:04,977
                    Heavens, no.

518
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,313
    I'm three times your age.   

519
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,548
You know that I'm young?        

520
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,801
Well, Woody, I may be old,      
      but I'm not stupid.       

521
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,823
      Well, why didn't you      
    ever tell me this?          

522
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:19,741
                Well, I enjoyed 
                your company so.

523
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:22,144
              And besides, every
              time I wanted to, 

524
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,014
            you started quoting 
            "The Jumping Frog   
            of Calaveras County"

525
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,769
  Now, I hope you're not upset  
            with me.            

526
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:30,870
      Oh, are you kidding?      

527
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:32,938
         I'm just glad          
I didn't have to dump you.

529
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,874
      And besides, you had      
such fun playing the part,      

530
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:37,576
 and you were quite excellent.  

531
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:39,762
    You sure you don't          
    want to marry me?           

532

                  ( <i>laughing</i> ): 
                  Ah, no, Woody.

533
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:42,548
Well, will you be               
my grandma?                     

534
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:45,884

It's a deal.                    

536

My birthday is July 23rd.

      I just gave you the watch.

         Well, I guess          
     in a really weird way,     

544
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:15,631
     it kind of worked out,     
        didn't it?              

545
