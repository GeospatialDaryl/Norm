00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,535
<i>(Sam)</i>                      
    <i>cheers </i> <i>is filmed before</i>    
     <i>a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,989
Well, not only is skin 
         the, uh, largest organ 
         in the body,

3
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,191
but another interesting    
     little tidbit about skin

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,795
is that the, uh, human body    
 sheds about 3 pounds of it

5
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:15,496
over the course                
 of a year.

6
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:18,933
Ew. Some of mine   
             just crawled away.

7
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,635
I don't understand.     
        Where does it go?

8
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:22,403
Into the atmosphere.       
     Dust.

9
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,872
What?      
         Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,309
About 75% of all dust       
    is, uh, human skin.

11
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:31,178
That is really             
     interesting, mr. Clavin.

12
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:33,114
Yeesh!

13
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,449
Cliff, dust is not skin.   
     That's ridiculous.

14
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:38,152
Well, ok. Normie. Well,        
 you--you think i'm making      
 this stuff up?

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,188
It was 2 whole chapters     
    in  <i>the big book of skin.</i>

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,291
Frasier, straighten 
            him out, ok?

17
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,528
What happens       
             to old, dead skin?

18
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,497
Apparently,                    
 it sits on bar stools          
 and drinks beer all day.

(carla)         
                sam, i've been  
                fiddlin' around

35
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,078
with the computer           
    in there,

36
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,847
and i just can't               
 seem to enter                  
 rebecca's system.

37
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,733
Take a number.

38
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,936
Well, exactly why      
         do you wanna use       
         rebecca's computer?

39
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,837
Because i--i just have 
         this great idea

40
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,157
that i think would really  
     improve things in the bar.

41
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,458
Yeah? Like what?

42
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,610
Well, i wanna tap  
             into the corporate 
             payroll system

43
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,695
and give myself 
                a big raise.

44
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,631
Well, how would that           
 improve the bar?

45
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:32,533
Come on.           
             I'd be a much      
             happier employee

46
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:36,037
and less likely to do  
         things like this       
         to customers.

47
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,140
Well, best of luck, then.

48
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,544
You can't get into         
     the main computer

49
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,046
without rebecca's          
     secret password.           
     You know that.

50
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:47,231
Yeah, well, i'm trying         
 to figure out what             
 the password is.

51
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,067
Well, it's usually  
            something personal.

52
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,551
How about "loser"?

53
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,303
Tried it.

54
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,038
Uh, "flunky"?  
    Tried it.

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,740
How about                      
 "hard-working                  
 young woman

56
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,025
who never gets                 
 the recognition                
 she deserves"?

57
00:02:58,093 --> 00:02:59,360
It's too many letters, man.

58
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,031
Then how about                 
 "screw-up"?

59
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,866
Worth a try. All right.    
 (Sam)                          
 go for it.

60
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,600
Yeah.

61
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,836
I tell you, you know,          
 if i ever ran this bar again,  
 if it was mine,

62
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:10,271
there'd be a lot of            
 changes around here.

63
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,140
I would have raises            
 right across the board.

64
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:13,941
Woody, how much                
 you make an hour?

65
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,243
$7.

66
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,294
You're kidding me.

67
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,212
I only make $6.80.

68
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,382
Hey, carla,             
        try "skinflint"!

69
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,568
What are you                   
 readin' there, wood?

70
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,938
Oh, well, my landlord  
         raised my rent,

71
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,175
and, you know,         
         i like my neighborhood 
         and all but...

72
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,976
well, i lived there 
            for a long time.

73
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,978
I guess                
         it's time to move on.

74
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:36,581
'Cause if you're not           
 lookin' at the sports, uh...

75
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,338
hey, check this out.

76
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,907
"High-security building,       
 large units, back bay area."

77
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,542
They only want  
                $250 a month.

78
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,760
No way.

79
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,363
Well, just out                 
 of curiosity, woody, uh,

80
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,131
what's this place called?

81
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,699
"Acme self-storage."

82
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:59,236
It sounds pretty           
     swanky, huh?

83
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:00,821
Woody, i have                  
 a feeling you--

84
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,642
you really wouldn't            
 like to live there.

85
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,126
Well, why not, dr. Crane?

86
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,378
Is it because you live     
     in the back bay?

87
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,914
Is it because you'd be         
 embarrassed to have me         
 as your neighbor?

88
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:13,251
Well, this is a free country.  
 I can live anywhere i want.

89
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,103
Ok, but no loud parties.

90
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:19,107
[Sighing]

91
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:20,674
no luck, sammy.

92
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:23,310
I guess, uh, i don't know. 
     I can't get                
     into that computer.

93
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:25,479
I'm just gonna keep on     
     workin' for peanuts.

94
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,281
Hey, how about peanuts?

95
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,150
Well, that would be    
         a stupid password.

96
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:32,686
No, i mean pass the peanuts.   
 Cliff sneezed                  
 all over the pretzels.

97
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:34,956
Oh, yeah, sure.             
    Like i was the only one.

98
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,946
You know, i've had         
     a password lock            
     on my computer for years.

99
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:45,049
See, after every session,      
 i transcribe my notes          
 into my p.C.

100
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,635
We're talking about some,      
 you know,                      
 very sensitive, intimate,

101
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:50,938
sometimes shocking             
 information nobody             
 should be privy to.

102
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,840
For example,               
     take a look at this guy.

103
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,310
And this lunatic's 
             a judge.

104
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,516
My whole world is a void.

105
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,318
Empty and without meaning.

106
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,987
There's no point to anything,  
 and there's nothing left to do

107
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,556
but just count the minutes     
 until i die.

108
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,942
Oh, hear that, gang?        
    Our hive has found a queen.

109
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,078
(All)                  
         hail, queen.

110
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,363
What's wrong?

111
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,498
My life is garbage.

112
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,266
Ah, rebecca, cheer up.         
 Have some pretzels.

113
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:20,668
No, no, no, no!

114
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,439
What's the trouble             
 this time?

115
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:29,143
I just found out that  
         robin bought a house   
         on the left bank

116
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:30,945
for his babe,      
             jean-marie.

117
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:32,680
Bought her a house?            
 Jeez, that's tough.

118
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,448
Ah, big deal.      
             Him buying a house

119
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,618
is like anyone else    
         buying a dozen roses.

120
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:38,753
Yeah, or a box of candy.

121
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:39,987
Or an engagement ring.

122
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,358
Thanks, woody.

123
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,093
I just like                    
 to participate.

124
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:51,732
Frasier,

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,569
you're possibly 5% smarter     
 than anyone else here.

126
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,003
What do you think?

127
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:57,572
Do you think that              
 he bought her a house

128
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,508
for, you know, maybe just      
 the heck of it?

129
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,493
You know, i've seen        
     this sort of thing a lot.

130
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,461
What, people buying houses     
 for no good reason?

131
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,265
No. Desperate women 
            like you            
            grabbing at straws.

132
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,734
Pathetic, isn't it?

133
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,004
I've got to quit       
         fooling myself here.

134
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,440
Robin called           
         from the airplane

135
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,074
and left a message         
     on my answering machine

136
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,609
and said that he needed 
        to talk to me.

137
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,278
And we all know             
    what that means.            
    You know, break up with me.

138
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,247
Well, now,                     
 i have a question.

139
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,966
When he left that message      
 he was flying                  
 on the concorde, right?

140
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,601
Sure, but what does        
     that have to do with it?

141
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,270
Well, it doesn't               
 make sense.

142
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,073
I mean, if mr. Colcord         
 was flying faster              
 than the speed of sound

143
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,874
when he left                   
 a break-up message             
 for you,

144
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,377
wouldn't he get here           
 before you got the message?

145
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:40,231
You--you see that, uh,

146
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,367
that telephone sound   
         is being carried       
         by radio waves

147
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,619
which are much faster      
     than normal sound waves.

148
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,056
All right, look, let's say,    
 you and i both are gonna       
 break up with rebecca,

149
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,557

            a megaphone, right,

            over the radio.

151
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,260
Now, how far away is she?

152
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:53,511
Like a mile.

153
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,631
By the time            
         she gets my message,

154
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:59,083
she's already cryin'   
         from being dumped      
         by you.

155
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,020

     that's amazing, wood,

Isn't it dangerous  
            to have a baby      
            on a rocket ship?

162
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,741
What should i do, frasier?

163
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:24,875
Well,

164
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:27,111
are you certain that        
    robin intends to leave you?

165
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,596
Well, what else             
    could it be?

166
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:30,832
And the bad part is,           
 all i can do is                
 stand here like a sap

167
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,266
and wait for it                
 to happen.

168
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,968
Well, rather than playing  
     your usual passive role,

169
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,838
why don't you take         
     an active stance           
     and beat him to the punch?

170
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,306
You mean break up              
 with him first?

171
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:41,425
Exactly. Preserve       
        your pride and dignity.

172
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,311
I guess that's                 
 what i needed to hear.

You know,

         there are some people

175
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,700
who actually feel  
             a moral obligation

176
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,319
to pay for             
         this sort of advice.

         get my message?

Yes, i got                     
 your message, robin.

183
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,241

you bought a house for          
your little  <i>charge d'affaires,</i>

 treated like one.

It's about time i stood up     
 and told you what i really     
 think of you.

Rebecca,

189
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:27,855
i was wondering if you might   
 consider moving in with me.

190
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,258
Ok.

00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:42,983
Yeah, but you set me up.       
 You gave me a fudgesicle.      
 It's all over it.

260
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,052
Wait a minute,             
     wait a minute,             
     wait a minute, you guys.

261
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,788
Let's not jump to any      
     wild conclusions here.

262
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:49,590
Let's just look        
         at the facts.

263
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,826
Now all we                 
     really know is that

264
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:55,329
robin is using             
     my--my secret password

265
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:58,666
to break into my corporation's 
 confidential files.

266
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,286
And from the date on these,    
 well, it looks like he's been  
 doing it since...

267
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,973
well, since the day after  
     we first slept together.

268
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,042
So all i think we can really   
 conclude from this is that

269
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,879
i am too stupid to live!

270
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,141
[Crying]            
            oh, god, i don't    
            believe this.

271
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,560
Oh, man.

272
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:29,280
<i>Is everybody</i>

<i>[Electronic bird chirping]</i>

274
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,285
hey, is this guy               
 great or what?

275
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,803
You can make him do            
 darn near anything             
 with this remote.

276
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,405
Can you make him       
         strangle me?

277
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,174
Well, let's see.

278
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,276
I know you can make him        
 punch someone in the groin

279
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,544
or maybe that was              
 just a fluke.

280
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,782
Woody, woody.

281
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,537
I cannot believe       
         that robin would       
         use me like this.

282
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:55,139
Yeah, i know, he seems         
 like such a decent guy.

283
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,074
I mean,                        
 it's not like he ever,         
 you know,

284
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,911
cheated on                     
 any of your friends            
 in a business deal.

285
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:03,180
Oh. Well, no. Actually,        
 he did, didn't he? Hmm.

286
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:05,516
Well, at least                 
 you never caught him           
 with another woman.

287
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,118
Oh, shoot.                     
 That happened, too.

288
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,539
Well, maybe this            
    is the very last            
    bad thing he does.

289
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,273
Yeah. That's it.

290
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:19,213
Gee, sam,              
         do you think so?

291
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:22,633
Rebecca, maybe you are 
         too stupid to live.

292
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,801
It's quite obvious     
         from this information

293
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,771
that robin's planning  
         a hostile takeover     
         of your corporation.

294
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,807
And since that's        
        your computer password,

295
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,711
it could look like     
         you're in on it, too.

296
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:36,931
Wait a minute.                 
 I could-- i could go           
 to jail for this.

297
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,016
Well, forget it.

298
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,737
I'm just gonna take this   
     information, and i'm gonna 
     have to turn him in.

299
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:45,189
If he thinks           
         i'm gonna go to jail   
         to save his butt,

300
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,457
he can forget it.

301
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,974
(Sam)          
                 there you go.

302
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,060
But it is                      
 the cutest butt.

303
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,496
You should see it when it      
 comes out of the shower.

304
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:54,298
Yeah, that's-- 
                 that's ok.     
                 That's ok.

305
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,799
You know,                  
     it beads all up            
     like a shiny, new car.

306
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,268
That's good, ok.

307
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,270
(Sam)      
                     yo, woody!

308
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,454
Hey, woody,         
            we're leavin', man!

309
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,108
Right behind you, sam!

310
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:05,860
[Woody imitating horn honking]

311
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,283
so, is, uh, robin   
            dead meat, yet?

312
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,318
Uh-uh. No, he's got         
    another 15 minutes,

313
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,654
then rebecca's going           
 to go down to have a meeting   
 with the board of directors

314
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:18,956
and spill the beans.

315
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,590
How's she holding up,          
 by the way?

316
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,293
You know, honestly,            
 i've never seen her            
 like this.

317
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,561
Really upset.

318
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:27,081
You know, the first guy    
     i ever fell in love with   
     did the same thing.

319
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,883
Treated me like a dog.

320
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,552
He borrowed my car, 
            he sold it,

321
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,255
he gave the money          
     to his other girlfriend,

322
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,590
and then he didn't     
         even have the decency  
         to apologize.

323
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,225
Hmm.                       
                 But i got even 
                 with him.

324
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,827
[Laughing]                     
 i bet you did.                 
 What'd you do?

325
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:41,395
I married him.

326
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,131
You remember   
                 nick, huh?

327
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,199
[Laughing]

328
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:51,155
anyways, i agree with rebecca. 
 That colcord's a creep.

329
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,273
(All)                  
         yeah.

330
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,307
Tell her                       
 the worst part, norm.

331
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,343
She made us carry      
         this huge, heavy desk.

332
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,646
No, no, the part is,           
 she could go                   
 to jail for this.

333
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,348
Yeah, but, sammy,          
     that was some heavy desk.

334
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,250
What kind of wood      
         was that made out of?

335
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,652
Uh, it must have           
     been oak.

336
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,855
Yeah?      
     It's one of your           
     heavier grains. Yeah.

337
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,924
Well, as any lumberjack     
    would tell you, though,

338
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:12,026
it's not the, uh, toughest one 
 to cut through.                
                     No?

339
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:16,196
No, no. Hey, doc, uh, what do  
 you think the toughest thing   
 to cut through is?

340
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,165
Your unending bull.

341
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,504
Now, look,

342
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:27,074
i think it's appropriate       
 that we all consider the fact

343
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,977
that rebecca could  
            possibly go         
            to prison for this.

344
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:31,244
I mean, can you imagine

345
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:34,047
our helpless rebecca   
         in a women's prison?

346
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,118
Yeah.

347
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:39,220
Come on, wait,             
     this is serious.

348
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,956
What do you think, sam?        
 What do you think              
 she'll be wearin', huh?

349
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:45,676
Faded cutoff jeans             
 with a work shirt tied         
 just above the belly button?

350
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,828
Or a tight uniform             
 that sweats through

351
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,931
when she's wrestling           
 the sadistic warden, huh?

352
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,069
No, no. Look,          
         later, later,          
         you know?

353
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:59,873
At the end of the day,     
     when we have               
     a moment to relax.

354
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,708
No, wh-what are we         
     talking about here?

355
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,177
She's not gonna         
        go to jail.

356
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,078
She's gonna turn           
     that rich creep in.

357
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,548
(Sam)                          
 i better go see if she needs   
 a ride or something.

358
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,116
Hey, cliff, uh,

359
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,218
wet tank top, no bra,

360
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,769
tussle in the shower.

361
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,054
Hey.   
 No, no, no, wait, wait,        
 whoa, whoa.

362
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,056
Save it for later.

363
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:17,758
Time to go.                    
 Whoo!

364
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:21,061
Boy, did i miss                
 a poker game in here           
 or something?

365
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,929
I'm such a wreck, sam.

366
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,832
This last 24 hours         
     has been

367
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,067
a blurry stream of             
 chocolate and cigarettes,

368
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,769
cigarettes and chocolate.

369
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,605
I'd kill for a chocolate    
    cigarette right now.

370
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:36,043
I just... i can't go    
        through with this, sam. 
        I just can't do it.

371
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,262
Hold on now.                   
 No, you got to here.

372
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:40,447
I mean,                        
 you got robin's papers.        
 All you got to do is,

373
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,683
go down and hand 'em over.     
 I don't see                    
 what the problem is.

374
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,668
The problem is         
         that i love him, sam.

375
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,803
Oh, you're not--               
 you're not                     
 thinking rationally here.

376
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,156
Why do you say that?   
 You're about to light          
 a tootsie roll.

377
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,061
Wh-what? You don't love        
 the guy. Come on.

378
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:56,279
What do you know   
             about it?

379
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,548
You're not there           
     when we're alone together.

380
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,085
He's warm and tender   
         and giving.

381
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,888
He's a crook.

382
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:05,973
That's just    
                 his way, sam.

383
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,310
He's not an evil person.

384
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:12,112
I--i know in his heart         
 of hearts that he really does  
 love me.

385
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,582
You know, there's a lot of     
 women that are higher up       
 in the corporation than me,

386
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,150
but he chose to take           
 advantage of me.

387
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:20,571
Doesn't that                   
 tell you something?

388
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:24,074
I mean, would it be         
    so terrible if i didn't     
    turn him in?

389
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:25,375
What would happen?

390
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,010
I'll tell--                
     he would go to jail,

391
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,479
and you would           
        go to jail, too.

392
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,180
I know, i know.

393
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,082
Any chance we'd go         
     to the same jail?

394
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,518
Huh! How much          
         are you gonna take

395
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,220
before you realize         
     this guy is                
     no good for you?

396
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,455
I don't--                      
 i don't know, sam.

397
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,423
How much does it take when     
 you're in love with someone?

398
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,926
You know, i've heard           
 stories about you              
 and that diane girl.

399
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:45,896
You put up with her            
 for 5 years.                   
 5 years! What about that?

400
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,248
Sweetheart, i-if i could   
     have sent her to prison,

401
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:50,017
don't you think        
         i would have?

402
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,225
Anyways, anyways,              
 it's not just between          
 the 2 of you.

403
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:02,062
There--there's, you know,      
 shareholders,                  
 uh, their families.

404
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,298
I mean, thousands of people    
 could be hurt by this.

405
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:07,634
You know, and if you don't     
 do something about it,         
 it's gonna be on your head.

406
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,336
I know.            
             You're right, sam.

407
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,670
Yeah.

408
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,239
Ok.

409
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,208
I'm ready to talk to    
        the board of directors.

410
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,343
Yeah, that's my girl.

411
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,061
Just don't turn            
     your back on them.

412
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,746
Why, because they're all       
 as treacherous as robin?

413
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,832
No. You just sat   
             in a snickers bar.

414
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:24,168
Oh, darn.                  
     That's my favorite.

415
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:27,437
Guys,               
            she's goin' for it.

416
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:28,672
Give him hell,                 
 rebecca!

417
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,840
Yeah, give him what            
 for there, becky.

418
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,175
We're proud of you.

419
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,142
Snitch!

420
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,281
[Clearing throat]          
     well, i guess i'd better   
     go call vera back.

421
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,351
W-what are you                 
 talking about?                 
 She didn't call.

422
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:43,019
Uh, yeah, she did. 
             Yesterday.

423
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:46,557
Something about, uh,    
        flat tire, interstate.

424
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,192
What the hell's the number 
     of that call box?

425
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,830
Is rebecca here, perchance?

426
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:57,451
She was supposed to have       
 moved into my apartment.       
 And not only is she missing,

427
00:18:57,518 --> 00:19:01,421
but i seem to be missing       
 some documents that i need.

428
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,726
Well, she just left    
         on an errand.

429
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,561
I believe it had       
         something to do with

430
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:11,297
nailing someone's      
         rich hide to the wall.

431
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:14,184
I see. Do tell her             
 i was here.

432
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,586
You bet.

433
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,921
Sweet baby.

434
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,226
How you doing there?

435
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:42,613
Trying to figure out           
 the best way to approach this.

436
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,481
[Sighing]

437
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,284
i guess i should lead off  
     by saying that             
     i knew nothing about it.

438
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:49,352
But if i convince them that 
    i knew nothing about it,

439
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,623
and all the information     
    came through me, then       
    i'm gonna look like a fool.

440
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,441
I think that's         
         your ace in the hole.

441
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,510
He'll see you now.

442
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:59,663
Excuse me. What's this 
         supposed to be anyway?

443
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:05,402
[Sighing]

444
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,371
here i go.         
             Wish me luck.

445
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,456
Good luck, babe.

446
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,441
[Elevator bell dings]

447
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,243
rebecca. My darling.

448
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:14,594
What are you doing?

449
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,529
I'm turning you in.

450
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:20,067
You used me.                
    And don't try to deny it    
    because i've got proof.

451
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:23,937
Robin, i am a human being      
 and i deserve to be treated    
 like one.

452
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,706
Well, it's about time       
    i stood up                  
    and did what was right.

453
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,692
Goodbye, robin.

454
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,177
Rebecca.

455
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:32,712
Will you marry me?

456
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:36,917
Ok.

457
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,288
Whoa, whoa, whoa,              
 wait a second! Whoa!

458
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,206
Wait! Come on!                 
 Open your eyes here!

459
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,375
He doesn't want                
 to marry you.                  
 He's just using you.

460
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,360
Well, actually,    
             yes, i am.         
     See?

461
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:50,213
I'm using rebecca to make me   
 the happiest man on earth.

462
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,165
Oh, man.

463
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:52,766
Oh, isn't he       
             the sweetest baby?

464
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,686
Get out here. Listen,          
 he's just marrying you         
 to shut you up,

465
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:57,854
so he can take over        
     the corporation.

466
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,522
Yes, to give to her    
         as a wedding present,

467
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,258
and now you've         
         spoiled the surprise.  
         Happy?

468
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,027
I don't                
         believe you!

469
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:07,014
Honey, listen, you got-- you   
 got the evidence in your hand, 
 right here.

470
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:09,800
If somebody comes out          
 and sees this,                 
 you're gonna be guilty, too.

471
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,803
Yes, well, then we must 
        make sure that          
        no one sees it.

472
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,051
Excuse me.

473
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,588
Boy, you really                
 come prepared,                 
 don't you?

474
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,374
Well, i guess our business     
 here is finished.              
 For rebecca's sake,

475
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:36,626
this conversation              
 never happened.

476
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:38,912
The--the part happened 
         where you proposed     
         to me, didn't it?

477
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,215
Of course, my darling,         
 that was destiny.

478
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:49,156
Where's miss howe?

479
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:53,059
Uh, she just went down      
    to, uh, plug the meter.

480
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:54,912
Well, that seems very odd.

481
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,095
Uh, why is that?

482
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:57,947
We validate.

483
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,566
[Elevator bell chiming]     
                oh.

484
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,034
Oh, well,              
         h-here's the elevator.

485
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,969
I'll run down there        
     and tell--tell her that.

486
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:06,773
Yes, and you might also        
 tell her that we're deeply     
 concerned about her behavior.

487
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,792
Uh, why is that?

488
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,661
After she called               
 this emergency meeting         
 of the board of directors,

489
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:14,097
we did a little research    
    on miss howe

490
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,250
just to remind ourselves    
    who she was.

491
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:20,070
Turns out                  
     she works for us.

492
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:23,523
How about that?

493
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,196
We also discovered             
 that she's been receiving

494
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:33,233
a great deal of                
 classified information         
 on her personal computer.

495
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,402
We were hoping she was         
 coming here to explain         
 her actions

496
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,605
before we turned               
 this matter over               
 to the authorities,

497
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:39,923
which we'll do              
    right now.

498
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,624
No, whoa, whoa, wait.  
         Excuse me, excuse me.

499
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:44,110
But it's-- it's not 
            rebecca's fault.

500
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,413
It's not her.          
         It--it's robin colcord

501
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,581
who planned this whole  
        hostile takeover thing.

502
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,384
I mean, she called this 
        meeting to warn you.

503
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,286
It's not her fault.

504
00:22:52,353 --> 00:22:53,270
Robin colcord?

505
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,239
Yes. Yes, sir.         
         He's the one you want.

506
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,475
He was just using her, 
         you know,              
         to get information.

507
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,511
She's like a...        
         like an innocent dupe.

508
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,981
Mr. Malone, you're making      
 a very serious charge

509
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:07,217
against one of the leaders     
 of our financial community.

510
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,702
Do you have any evidence       
 to back it up?

511
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,037
Yeah, you bet i do.

512
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,522
You want evidence?

513
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,390
Look at this.          
         If this doesn't clear  
         rebecca's good name,

514
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,859
i don't know    
                what will, huh?

515
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,260
I mean, look at it.
