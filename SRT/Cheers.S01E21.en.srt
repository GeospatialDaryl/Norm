1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,555
Sam, let me have the TV control.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,354
- What are you gonna watch?
- Something extraordinary on TV.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,234
- What's up. Game on?
- What is it, the Bruins?

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,633
l think the lady
singing the anthem is loaded.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,755
Diane, what the hell is this?

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,111
Wagner's ''Ring of the Nibelungs'',
the complete cycle.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,629
''Das Rheingold'', ''Die Walküre'',

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,479
''Siegfried''
and finally ''Götterdämmerung''.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,194
l hope they don't use
that canned laughter.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,113
lt's not comedy. This is opera.
l'll explain as we proceed.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,870
This is the story of a golden ring
with magical powers

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,639
that curses anyone who owns it.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,390
Wait. They had that same story
on <i>Scooby Doo</i> Saturday morning.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,838
But the dog sang
a little better than that.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,509
Come on, you guys. Give it a chance.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,750
The first three hours are...

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,353
l put up with your sporting events.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,994
lt's time that you return the favour.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,669
After ten minutes, if you aren't
totally mesmerised by its beauty,

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,598
- l will turn it off.
- Ten minutes?

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,115
Very funny.

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,111
Culture's wasted on you.
Oxygen is wasted on you.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,760
That was not a very nice thing
to do to Diane.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,475
- Sam's got a point there.
- She has watched a lot of sports.

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,670
Let's give it another shot.

26
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,434
Coach, l'm gonna be in the back
checking the wine.

27
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,073
OK, Sam.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,992
Would you like to join me?
lt's quiet, empty, dimly lit.

29
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,148
Much like your mind.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,318
So, what do you say?

31
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,273
Sam, you talk a lot
about our having a dalliance,

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,437
but l've always been told
that barking dogs don't bite.

33
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,710
Biting. ls that what you're into?

34
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,915
Do you know what bothers me? There
are women upon whom this works,

35
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,271
and they're allowed
to vote and drive cars.

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,476
So, what do you say?

37
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,316
Fred and Ginger are taking a break,

38
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,398
but they'll be back
to nauseate you later on.

39
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,791
Eddie, it's been nice talking to you.

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,596
By the way, did l tell you that
my wife passed away some time ago?

41
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,235
Yeah.

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,469
Thanks. l really appreciate that.
ls your wife dead yet, Ed?

43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,550
That's good. l wanna thank you
for thinking about me,

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,432
and l'll get back to you.

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,516
So long, pal.

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,674
What is it?

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,679
Pal of mine, Eddie Fuentes, manages
in the Winter Leagues in Venezuela.

48
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,793
He says if l can learn Spanish,
he might have a job for me, coaching.

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,990
You mean you're gonna
return to coaching?

50
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,793
Yeah,
baseball's so much simpler than life.

51
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,354
ln baseball
l always know where l'm at.

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,268
We're up, l'm in the coach's box.
They're up, l'm in the dugout.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,712
The game is over, l hit the head,
get a cheeseburger.

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,035
- Sounds like a great life.
- lt's terrific.

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,276
You know any Spanish, Coach?

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,473
l took some courses for a couple
of days just to learn a few phrases.

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,635
Like what?

58
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,357
Like, ''How tall is my dentist?''
and ''ls that really your sister?''

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,436
Just enough to get by.

60
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,072
- You're gonna do fine, Coach.
- Thanks, Cliff.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,034
lnteresting.

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,153
That was Sam's brother.
He's on his way over.

63
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,113
- Brother? Didn't know he had one.
- Me either.

64
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,629
- He didn't tell any of you?
- Coach?

65
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,354
<i>Si?</i>

66
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,195
- Did you know Sam has a brother?
- Of course l know he had a brother.

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,356
- He hates him.
- Why does he hate him?

68
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,429
He was cruel to him. When Sam was a
kid, he'd shove his head underwater.

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,870
Wait a minute. That was my brother.

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,351
Come to think of it,
that was my head.

71
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,272
Don't Sam and his brother
spend any time together?

72
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,109
They get together whenever he's in
town, but he's never been to Cheers.

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,674
He's coming now,
and someone has to tell Sam.

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,028
Let me do it. l'm a smoothie
about breaking bad news.

75
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,556
- Your apartment burned down.
- My God. Really?

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,754
No. Your brother's on his way over.
Makes you feel better, doesn't it?

77
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,078
- l hate it when you do that.
- lt cushions the blow.

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,555
- My brother's in town?
- l took the call.

79
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,117
- He was just leaving his hotel.
- Good. Did you tell him l was here?

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,437
Of course. l had no idea
this would be a problem.

81
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,519
No problem. My brother's coming over.
l love my brother.

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,631
That's not what l heard.

83
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,159
Step in here and let me show you
something l've triumphed over.

84
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,911
Don't tell me
you've finally mastered the stapler.

85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,918
Sit down. What they were
talking about out there

86
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,032
is l used to have this problem
with my brother, Derek.

87
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,470
lt was kind of...
an inferiority complex.

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,310
But that was a long time ago,
and l conquered it.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,117
Here it is. This is the guy that
used to make me feel like nothing.

90
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,716
What?

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,470
He's very nice-looking. He'd be even
better if he had his two front teeth.

92
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,239
l blacked those out myself.

93
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,555
That was before
l got over my problem.

94
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,117
l didn't go to any psychiatrists.
l didn't read any fancy books.

95
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,030
l just sat myself down and said,
''My brother's no better than l am.''

96
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,593
l'm sure you're right.

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,473
- What's he do for a living?
- He's an international lawyer.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,231
lt so happens l come from
a very intelligent family.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,754
l guess Derek does OK for himself.

100
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,350
He must make 50, 50 grand a year.

101
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,633
You're kidding.
Those guys make 1 0 times that much.

102
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,437
lt's the job. Last year he travelled
so much, he had to buy his own plane.

103
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,835
What kind of life is that?

104
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,116
The poor wretch.

105
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,149
Who am l kidding? The guy
is better at everything than l am.

106
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,429
He's perfect.

107
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,509
Sam. He's maybe a man
of some accomplishment,

108
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,156
but this all sounds like a younger
brother idealising his older sibling.

109
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,350
- You think so?
- Sure.

110
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,516
He's just an ordinary Joe.

111
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,915
Can l keep this?

112
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,513
You must have a sense of humour
about these things.

113
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,031
Maybe you're right. lf l looked
at it right, it could be funny.

114
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,436
- Sure.
- One less tooth and a moustache.

115
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,075
Sam, nuclear bomb just hit Boston.

116
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,156
Derek's here.

117
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,593
They're catching on.

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,511
Listen. Wait.
l don't want you to worry about me.

119
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,950
l'm used to living around
Mr Wonderful all my life.

120
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,757
lt's no big deal. lt's just that when
he's in the room, l feel invisible.

121
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,475
Sam, l don't pay you
a lot of compliments,

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,230
but l really don't feel you have
any need to feel inferior to anyone.

123
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,872
Thank you. That's very nice.

124
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,350
- Nice voice. Who is that?
- Guess.

125
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,116
Way to go, Derek.

126
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,075
- Can we get this man a beer?
- l'll get it.

127
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,156
Sam, sorry, l didn't see you.

128
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,038
Derek, how about a beer?

129
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,720
No, thank you, Norm.

130
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,993
What a guy.
Can l catch a beer, Sammy?

131
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,909
- Where are my waitresses?
- Watching the show.

132
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,476
- The show?
- Derek's doing trick pool shots.

133
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
Must have had fun
growing up with him.

134
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,237
Do you have any idea what kind
of gift l could get for Derek?

135
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,032
- Gift?
- l feel l should get him something.

136
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,435
He did get me a job.

137
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,791
He got you a job, after all
those months you're been looking?

138
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,230
Not just a job.
He got me a great job.

139
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,272
For the first time
l'm gonna have my own parking space.

140
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,598
Got a secretary, a window
for water bombs, all the perks.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,913
- Good for you, Norm. That's great.
- So what can l get him?

142
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,191
l really don't care what you get him.
Get him a tie.

143
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,630
Sure. l wouldn't dare
buy clothes for that guy.

144
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,877
He has his lint made in England.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,788
Norm, hurry up. He's gonna do
some tap-dancing for us.

146
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,114
You two, come on back here.
We got a rich guy tap-dancing.

147
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,711
Sammy.

148
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,559
Your brother is one good-looking guy.

149
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,751
Did you ever hear Derek say
anything about being a sucker for

150
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,236
swarthy, fertile,
Mediterranean types?

151
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,514
- Afraid not, Carla.
- Figured.

152
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,757
Let me have a couple of Heinekens
and a couple of Löwenbräus.

153
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,399
How come your brother has beautiful
curly blond hair and deep blue eyes?

154
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,478
- Are they blue?
- Like Windex.

155
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,436
Boy, sounds like the stick lady's
having a good time, doesn't it?

156
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,116
ls that Diane's laugh? l thought they
were killing chickens back there.

157
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,391
He really got to her when he told
her about that time in Paris

158
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,556
when he got drunk with Anais Nin.

159
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,036
Really?

160
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,196
l was hoping you'd know.

161
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,916
Derek's always been like that,
always had to have the spotlight,

162
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,996
had to be the centre of attention.

163
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,795
lf it's any consolation to you,
l know how you feel.

164
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
l got a sister
who's got me beat in every way.

165
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,150
She's five foot two,

166
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,232
her husband never has a drink
until noon, and she's a beautician.

167
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
How do you compete with that?

168
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,675
But after a while l said to myself,
''To hell with her. l'm me.''

169
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,712
What you're trying to say is
l'm as good as my brother?

170
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,673
You're kidding?
You're not even as good as my sister.

171
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,195
But l still like you best, Sam.

172
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,709
That makes two of us.

173
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,716
Wait a minute.

174
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,432
What do you think?
You think Diane likes Derek?

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,994
''Does Diane like Derek?'' l don't
know. l'll pass her a note in gym.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,629
l know what my brother's like
around women, and l know Diane.

177
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,513
You know something?
l used to admire you.

178
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,279
But know what's happened to you
since she got here?

179
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,437
You've turned into a big weenie.

180
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,552
You're a dink, a wimp,
a fred, a loser.

181
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,033
Thank you.

182
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,436
l was having a confidence problem,
but that's been a real boost.

183
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,397
Just a few weeks ago, you were making
time with every foxy lady in Boston,

184
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,909
on your way to legendary status.

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,589
You were heading
for the Hounds Hall of Fame.

186
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,837
Then Lady Fishface
walked in the door.

187
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,750
- What's going on here?
- l don't know. lt's driving me nuts.

188
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,836
Maybe she's playing hard-to-get,

189
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,033
but hard-to-get for me used to mean
l'd have to sit through dinner.

190
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,151
lf you can't get to her, no one can.

191
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,636
- What about Derek?
- ln a minute.

192
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,552
But don't worry.
He's got better taste than that.

193
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,513
- What?
- Your brother's teaching me Spanish.

194
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,033
You're learning the Spanish language
in one evening?

195
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,669
You want me to take the bar over?

196
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,997
l get it. You'd rather be here
when he's back there, right?

197
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,271
- Something like that.
- You don't have to draw me pictures.

198
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,119
Although l like it,
but you don't have to.

199
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,999
- What's your order?
- Sam, he's not that great.

200
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,033
He can tell an interesting story,
he's met a few interesting people,

201
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,312
but he's just a man like any other
man you'd meet in Greek mythology.

202
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,118
- What's your order?
- l don't have an order.

203
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,391
l thought you'd like to join
the party. l'll take the bar.

204
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,556
Go back there and enjoy yourself.

205
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,152
Believe it or not, l'm having a lot
of fun just being out here by myself.

206
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,750
l swear, it does not bother me
that my brother's here.

207
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,157
- Really?
- Really.

208
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,550
Good. l feel better
telling you about something.

209
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,276
Derek wants a beer.

210
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,436
l'm buying. l'm taking care of this.

211
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,073
l'm buying.

212
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,836
Sam, l love this bar of yours.

213
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,077
But you know the best thing about it?
lts owner.

214
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,236
- Thanks, Sam.
- Derek, one more game of pool.

215
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,755
You were about to tell me something.

216
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,077
Derek just wants to fly me out
to Martha's Vineyard tonight.

217
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,910
ln a plane or on his back?

218
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,109
He didn't say, specifically.

219
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,550
Of course, he was all excited about
the new Learjet he just bought.

220
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,514
- But it's not a date or anything.
- What if it is? lt's OK with me.

221
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,469
- l thought maybe you'd be bothered.
- Bothered?

222
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,831
l have a date myself tonight.
lt's a good night for it.

223
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,472
OK. lf you're sure.

224
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,876
l think you and Derek
will make a great match.

225
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,395
Really?

226
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,069
You both think you're perfect,
and one of you is right.

227
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,990
You know what your problem is?
You are afraid of your feelings.

228
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,317
l am not. l don't have
any feelings about this.

229
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,591
Whatever you and my brother
Derek want to do is OK with me.

230
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,039
l don't care.

231
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,755
- Fine.
- Please don't go.

232
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,555
What? What did you say?

233
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,353
l said l have no feelings about this.

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,676
No, after that. You said something.
lt sounded like ''Please don't go.''

235
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,950
Please don't go? Are you crazy?

236
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,038
You gotta get over
this egotism of yours.

237
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,675
Go, with my blessings.
Have a good time, really.

238
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,956
Please stay here.

239
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,630
Wait a minute.

240
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,389
What was that? There at the end
you said something.

241
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,514
You're hallucinating. Get outta here
and have a good time. Go on.

242
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,516
OK, l'm glad you understand.

243
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,995
- lf you go, l'll die.
- What?

244
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,677
- l heard you say something.
- You're coming unglued.

245
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,791
Please go. Have fun.

246
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,280
- OK, l'll go.
- There you go.

247
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,278
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to go freshen up.

248
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,791
- l'd rather stay with you.
- What? What did you say?

249
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,232
l didn't hear anything.

250
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,516
What do you say we go to the
Combat Zone and see a girlie show?

251
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,596
l've got a date, Coach.

252
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,157
Maybe l'll go alone.

253
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,236
lt's a tough neighbourhood.
l think you need some protection.

254
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,079
You're right, Sam.
What do you say, Carla?

255
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,794
- Not tonight, Coach.
- Maybe some other time. Good night.

256
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,755
- See you tomorrow, Sam.
- Yeah.

257
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,712
Want me to hang around
till your date gets here?

258
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,877
- You probably wanna get on home.
- Are you kidding? lt's 2am.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,752
My kids might be there.

260
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,437
Sammy, would you just
tell me one thing?

261
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,599
What do you see in her?

262
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,716
Who?

263
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,037
The one who was off
on a Learjet with your brother.

264
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,549
The one who can't stop talking.
The geek.

265
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,077
l know she's not perfect.
l know she talks too much.

266
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,555
She's all those things you said.

267
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,870
But there are times
when l'm with her she just...

268
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,355
irritates the hell out of me.

269
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,198
- That's what you're looking for?
- Maybe it is.

270
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,756
l know what you mean.
l'm always falling for guys l hate.

271
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,555
My whole life has been the wrong man
at the wrong time in the wrong place

272
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,035
with the wrong birth-control device.

273
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,515
Sam?

274
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,316
You ever thought, even for a minute,
about you and me?

275
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,795
Sure l have, Carla.

276
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,876
A recent minute?

277
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,191
l was always afraid
you'd be too much woman for me.

278
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,595
You're a wise man, Sam Malone.

279
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,992
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Debbie.

280
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,315
Boy am l glad
you could make it tonight.

281
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,877
lt really isn't very fair to call me
at the last minute like that.

282
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,878
lt's a good thing
my boyfriend's a heavy sleeper.

283
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,629
l just didn't feel like
being alone tonight.

284
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,189
- What do you want to do?
- Something with just the two of us.

285
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,154
l don't wanna think about anything
or anybody but us all night long.

286
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,235
