for this part in a play.

00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,638
Well, I don't                   
know, Sammy.                    

366
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:14,873
You seem to be sweating         
a little bit up there.          

367
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:15,874
         No, I'm not.           

368
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:16,975
             Yeah, that's okay. 

369
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,510
                 Nothing wrong  
                 with sweating. 

370
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:19,878
                 I, myself, have
                 perspired      

371
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:20,946
                 once or twice. 

372
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,797
We could grow rice.             

373
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,571
Oh, watch this.                 

374
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,873
                 Say, Rebecca.  

375
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:33,541
     Oh, excuse me for a minute.

376
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,877
Caroline, are you all right?    

377
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:37,545
You look kind                   
of depressed.                   

378
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,681
( <i>sighs</i> ):                      
Oh, Sam, it's                   
the same old thing.             

379
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:40,782
                What?           

380
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:42,884
I'm so in love                  
with my boss, and I             

381
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:45,520
just can't get                  
him to notice me.               

382
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,305
         Well, have you tried   
         kissing him like this? 

383
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,813
Oh, my God.                     

384
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,682
That was...                     

385
00:13:57,716 --> 00:13:59,584
That was...                     

386
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,887
Oh, thank heaven                
you showed it to me.            

387
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:05,023
There's no way anyone could     
possibly describe it.           

388
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:06,524
If I kiss him like that,        

389
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,960
he's bound to fall              
in love with me.                

390
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,595
Bye, Sam.                       

391
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:11,797
                    Bye-bye.    

392
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,565
                You two have a  
                great honeymoon.

393
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,534
             Thank you so much. 

394
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,004
Anything to get                 
my disc player back.            

395
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,371
            Hey, hey, hey...    

396
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,544
By the way, Rebecca,            

397
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,547
         how are things between 
         you and <i>your</i> boss?     

398
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,617
Anything, uh, I can do?         

399
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,319
These lips remind               
you of anything?                

400
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,325
     Yeah, I think the liver    
     in my freezer's gone bad.  

401
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:45,663
         What happened?         

402
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,598
     She couldn't possibly      
     have seen through          

403
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,000
 your little morality play.     

404
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:51,303
                Huh!            

405
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:52,904
Oh... hey!                      

406
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,372
What's going on here?           

407
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,942
                     Whatever do
                     you mean?  

408
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:00,795
Sam and Woody are trying        
desperately to kiss me.         

409
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,332
    Boy, someone's a little full
    of herself, isn't she?      

410
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:06,835
    Come on, Carla.             

411
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:07,869
What's the story here?          

412
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:08,904
One woman to another.           

413
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:10,772
                Why would I tell
                you something   

414
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:14,142
     about my two closest best  
     friends in the whole world?

415
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:15,510
I'll give you                   
a paid day off.                 

416
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,678
                 They got a bet.

417
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,681
            They want to see who
            could kiss you      

418
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,049
             by the end of      
             the shift tonight. 

419
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,319
Why would they do such an       
asinine, juvenile, thing?       

420
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:26,204
        Look at the contestants.

421
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,156
                     Actually,  

422
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,257
         Woody's doing it 'cause

423
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,391
         they were razzing him. 

424
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:32,193
         Sam's trying to prove  
         he still got it.       

425
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,828
             Other than that,   
             just cheap thrills.

426
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:36,865
         Don't tell them I know.

427
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,066
Wait a minute.                  

428
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,634
You're not                      
cooking up something            

429
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:41,502
that's going                    
to humiliate my friends         

430
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:43,337
and make them                   
look stupid, are you?           

431
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:44,372
                Well, yeah.     

432
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,457
How can I help?                 

433
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:54,433
         Oh, Miss Howe?         

434
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:55,867
 Can I ask you a question?      

435
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,602
Sure, Woody.                    
What do you want to know?       

436
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:01,039
         Um... which key unlocks
         the storage room?      

437
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:02,274
    I don't know.               

438
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:03,408
    Hold it still.              

439
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:07,212
                Look carefully, 
                very carefully. 

440
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,864
         You're getting sleepy. 

441
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:11,632
                    Very sleepy.

442
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,767
        Woody?                  

443
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:16,705
             Very, very, sleepy.

444
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:20,776
                 You'll do      
                 whatever I say.

445
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,461
Woody, go to sleep.             

446
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:31,903
( <i>snaps fingers</i> )               

447
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:36,040
                 Oh, no. I made 
                 her disappear. 

448
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:44,582
         To recap,              

449
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,718
 sitting in the bar today,      
     we have, among others,     

450
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,587
 a man who was actually simple  
 enough to hypnotize himself.   

451
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,809
I'd like to offer the suggestion
    that we've seen it all.     

452
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,977
Ten hut!                        

453
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:00,165
 Happily, I stand corrected.    

454
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:06,137
Well, it's time for me          
to be all that I can be.        

455
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:12,277
            You enlisted in     
            the Army, you idiot?

456
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:17,832
 Hey, we do more by 9:00 a.m.   
 than most people do all day.   

457
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,134
And that's a                    
selling point to you?           

458
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,790
 Yeah, and I've had a bellyful  
     of that Ayatolah guy.      

459
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,642
Quite frankly...                

460
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,529
    I don't like what's been    
 happening in the Persian Gulf. 

461
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:33,565
     So, I'm off to, uh...      
     I'm off to Persia.         

462
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:39,071
     I just wanted to shake     
     a few hands, say good-bye. 

463
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,305
                Kiss a few girls

464
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,040
for the last time.              

465
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,675
         Well, baby...          

466
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,278
     this is good-bye.          

467
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:47,412
Yep, this may be                

468
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:50,048
the last time                   
you ever see this dogface.      

469
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,584
         You can always take    
         a gander at this one.  

470
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,255
         Sam, I had no idea you 
         were this dedicated.   

471
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,692
             This is a wonderful
             thing you're doing 
             for our country.   

472
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,826
Well, thank you.                

473
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,728
         Kiss me, Sam, kiss me. 

474
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,965
                No, I can't kiss
                another soldier.

475
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,900
Not after Kevin.                

476
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,437
    Kevin? Who-who's Kevin?     

477
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:13,704
Kevin was my boyfriend          
in high school,                 

478
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,872
and we really loved             
each other,                     

479
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,107
and then                        
he enlisted in the Army,        

480
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,842
and I never wrote,              
and I never saw him again.      

481
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,644
 Well, he sounds like a creep.  
 Kiss me and make him jealous.  

482
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,346
No, Sam, I'm sorry.             

483
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,717
 Come home safely, doughboy.    

484
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:30,688
                    Damn!       

485
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:32,057
 I mean, what does it take?!    

486
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,725
         Well, maybe            
    you're being too subtle.    

487
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:37,912
    One hour.                   

488
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,382
I don't think

00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,285
Go on,                          
kiss and make up.               

609
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,758
         Remember,              
 you both owe me a big wet one. 

610
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:18,776
        Ah...                   

611
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,811
    Ah, I couldn't stay mad     
         at you, Sam.           

612
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,913
    You're just like            
    a brother to me.            

613
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:27,501
 Yeah, and if anyone ever does  
knock off the king around here, 

614
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,271
                I guess I hope  
                it's you, man.  

615
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:31,439
No hard feelings?               

616
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:32,907
             No hard feelings.  

617
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,210
Listen, Sam,                    
now that everything's okay,     

618
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,745
can I ask you something,        
guy to guy?                     

619
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,180
                Yeah, sure.     

620
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:41,849
    How was I?                  

621
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:49,156
            Don't-don't do that.

622
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,158
No, I mean it's a question      
you can't ask a girl.           

623
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:52,994
I mean, is there anything       
I need to work on?              

624
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:56,030
     No, see, I-I don't want    
     to talk about this, Woody. 

625
00:23:57,365 --> 00:24:00,467
     I was nervous, so I might  
     have been a little dry.    

626
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:02,436
Oh, for God's...! Yech!         

627
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,204
         No, I'm serious, Sam.  

628
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,807
    Hey, do you want to know    
         how you were?          

629
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,073
