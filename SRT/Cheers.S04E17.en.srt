1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,592
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,518
Good evening, you lucky dogs
and doggettes.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,669
Hey.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,913
Hey, inside this airtight container is
a taste sensation second to none.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,877
Get your taste buds ready.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,429
Ma's homemade pretzels.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,037
You know, they kind of look like
they were made in a home, Cliff.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,316
Yeah, well, they're a little
misshapen, you know?

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,074
Ma's arthritis made her
hands stiffen up on her.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,197
That explains the smell of
mentholatum then, huh?

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,108
Yeah, here you go, Sam.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,032
Chow down.
They're completely organic.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,479
So, what word would you folks
use to describe these babies?

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,950
- Filling.
- Okay. All right, they're filling.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,350
No, no. I just lost one.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,792
Yeah, well, you know, Norm, they're
pretzels. They're supposed to be hard.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,111
Hey, look, I'm gonna go share a
few with the guys in the back.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,238
A little bit of salt and mustard
on there and you really got something.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,595
Yeah, a lawsuit.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,397
I need some water.
I'm having trouble swallowing.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,198
Why are you trying?

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,909
Well, I figure it's either that,
or I have to take it out and look at it.

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,278
Everybody, I'd like you to meet
my date, Dr. Lilith Sternin,

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,989
M.D., Ph.D., Ed.D., APA.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,878
Boy, it sure isn't spelled
like it sounds.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,992
I'm so proud of Frasier.

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,879
He's making good on his vow
to start a new life.

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,559
Lilith and I met over drinks

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,836
after the chemical-dependency
seminar last week.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,231
By the way, I noticed your drinking
went beyond sociability.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,913
Woody, may I have two cognacs?

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,957
And what would you like?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,877
Come on, it was just
a meaningless joke.

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,076
There's no such thing
as a meaningless joke.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,276
- I'd forgotten.
- I'll have a white wine.

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,429
I'll have a beer.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,639
A beer, Woody, and white wine
for the charming lady.

38
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,829
Charming?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,275
Your flattery is
obligatory and specious.

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,152
Thank you.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,511
So how do you like Cheers?

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,474
Well, it seems adequate
for its purpose.

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,552
But I have a feeling that you only
brought me to this place

44
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,474
to surround yourself with people
you know and I don't.

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,276
Well, yes.

46
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,549
But what's more, I thought that we
might have a drink or two,

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,676
thereby lowering our inhibitions a bit,

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,751
and enabling us
to go back to your place,

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,911
and have a physical encounter
of some sort.

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,672
Well, we won't.

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,599
I appreciate your candour.

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,394
No, you don't.

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,950
You're right. I feel like striking you.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,669
Your attempt at machismo
is totally inadequate.

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,274
You can't even make eye contact.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,477
I could look at you if I wanted to.

57
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,037
But frankly, I've grown tired of
counting the comb marks in your hair.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,472
Now, if you'll excuse me,

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,029
I'm going to go and use
the little boys' room.

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,437
Why does a grown man
feel the need to euphemize?

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,996
Well, he did drink that beer
awfully fast.

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,950
That's the hospital. I'm on call.

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,634
With any luck, it will be one
of my manic-depressives

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,836
and the evening will take an upturn.

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,908
Well, you gotta love her, don't you?

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,719
Excuse me, miss?

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,350
Would you please inform Dr Crane
that I had to leave on an emergency?

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,272
And kindly relay this message:

69
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,756
"I've had a very
uncomfortable evening,

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,150
and I don't think we should see
each other in the future,

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,469
except professionally."

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,316
What? No good-night kiss?

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,635
I kiss only as a prelude to passion.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,752
Well, we've been warned.

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,392
Oh, dear.

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,235
It appears Frasier
has been rejected again.

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,589
That poor yutz.

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,991
Even the trash only gets dumped
once a week.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,873
- Where's Lilith?
- Dr Sternin was called away

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,155
on an emergency.

81
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,993
Well, that's all right.
Anyway, I didn't much care for Lilith.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,628
Sam, do you mind if I just use
your office for a moment?

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,870
Sure, sure. How come?

84
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,957
I'm going to weep.

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,715
Poor Frasier.
I wish he could find someone

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,632
to help him ease his loneliness.

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,958
Sam, couldn't you give him
one of your hand-me-downs?

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,678
I already did.

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,989
No, I was thinking of someone
who would be, like, fun.

90
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,354
Well, now that you mention it,
I guess I could prescribe

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,432
a little Candi Pearson
for Dr Crane.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,238
Candi. I like Candi.

93
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,433
I sincerely doubt that Frasier
would approve being set up

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,798
for a one-night stand
with one of your jiggling jugheads.

95
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,194
I am not talking
about sex necessarily.

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,876
I just think that Frasier should know
that women don't always mean misery.

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,160
I think Candi is just
what the doctor prescribed.

98
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,073
She's cute, she's fun and she's
never met a man she didn't like.

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,832
A lot.

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,235
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Candi.

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,913
Boy, is it good to see you.

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,071
You are beautiful as ever.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,508
Sam, I'm getting a little low.

104
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,830
I'm also running out of beer.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,558
Well, yeah.

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,790
Maybe I can help you out on both
counts here, Frasier.

107
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,313
I'd like you to meet Candi.

108
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,914
- Hi.
- Hi, yourself.

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,314
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a cute forehead?

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,038
Frankly, no, but I've been told
I have acute anxiety.

111
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,353
What's your name?

112
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,397
Dr Frasier Crane.

113
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,754
I'm Candi.

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,638
Yes, so I see from your necklace.

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,869
Candi, with an l.

116
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,477
Well, I used to spell it with a Y,
but nobody ever took me seriously.

117
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,792
So then I switched it to an l.
You know, like Gandhi?

118
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,273
Yes, yes. I understand
that's why he did it.

119
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,471
Could I buy you a drink?

120
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,437
Oh, sure.

121
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,756
- Something with bubbles.
- Very well.

122
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,391
Sam,

123
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,518
champagne cocktails Ã  deux.

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,520
It looks like you and Candi
are becoming friends.

125
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,750
Well, she seems like
a very pleasant sort.

126
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,070
Sam, she's not here
for you, is she?

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,993
No, no, no. It looks to me
like she's here for you, Frasier.

128
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,275
Well, yes, it does.

129
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,555
Well, you're lucky, doc.

130
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,915
You know, Sammy has never
bothered to set me up

131
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,798
with one of his bevy of babes.

132
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,995
Not that I need help.

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,515
No, just mercy.

134
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,750
Oh, I see. This is all a set-up.

135
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,275
Well, I've seen that movie before.

136
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,035
When all else fails, hire some
strumpet to date the town wretch.

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,078
Hey, this is not a set-up,
and she's not a strumpet.

138
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,674
She's just here because I thought
you might like each other.

139
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,389
No expectations, no frills.
You know, just kind of a casual thing.

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,069
Well, thanks, Sam, but no thanks.

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,593
Yeah, but...

142
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,308
I see your little attempt to corrupt
Frasier has failed miserably.

143
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,231
I'm sorry, miss, but I just
figured out what this is all about.

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,638
I'm not in the habit of fraternizing
with women of your type.

145
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,310
What type is that?

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,875
You know. Fun.

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,069
Good night.

148
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,919
I don't believe it.

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,275
Frasier just turned down Candi.

150
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,796
If it was me, I'd be making her
scrambled eggs by now.

151
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,838
I'm sure she'd prefer that to sex.

152
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,550
Why do you open your mouth?

153
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,079
I didn't know she was there, Norm.

154
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,915
You know, we need to put
a little bell on her.

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,515
I don't know what you think
this is all about,

156
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,558
but I just came here
because Sam said you were a nice guy

157
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,034
and you were down in the dumps.

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,035
And I thought maybe we could talk
a little bit and have a couple of laughs.

159
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,276
Well, fine. We've had that.

160
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,351
You've done your charity work
for the evening.

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,953
Charity work?

162
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,429
You really are a sad case.

163
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,798
How a guy with such a great forehead
could get so messed up.

164
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,398
Wait.

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,597
The least I can do is give you a ride
home. I'm going in your direction.

166
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,832
- Which direction?
- Out.

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,598
Thank you, Frasier.

168
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,352
You're sweet.

169
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,990
Say, you know, I just realized I'm
feeling kind of hungry.

170
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,392
- Would you like to get some food?
- Oh, food. My favourite.

171
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,832
Good Lord.

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,956
Frasier left with her?

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,588
Well, they have nothing in common.

174
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,832
What could he possibly have
to say to that woman?

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,037
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."

176
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,069
Pretzels.

177
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,468
Fresh pretzels.

178
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,029
Get your fresh pretzels here.

179
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,237
Delivered to you piping hot
from Ma Clavin's kitchen.

180
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,674
Come on, Norm. You're his friend.

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,308
You promised you'd tell him to stop
bringing that stuff in here.

182
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,234
All right. I'll take care of it
while I still have some teeth left.

183
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,397
Hey, incidentally, Normie,
I don't mind telling you,

184
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,189
you know, how much Ma appreciates
the fact that you guys like her pretzels.

185
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,998
- Great, Cliff, listen--
- She's been down in the dumps

186
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,149
these past 40 years.

187
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,995
You know, when she heard how you
felt about these babies, well,

188
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,628
she just broke right down and cried.

189
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,517
Oh, boy, pretzels.

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,833
Anyone seen Frasier yet?

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,355
No, not since he left
last night with Candi.

192
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,034
Yeah, I wonder what they did,
you know?

193
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,591
I'm sure they just
went out and had dinner.

194
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,597
Yeah, I bet they
had some dinner, all right.

195
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,591
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,594
A real good dinner in
a real fine restaurant, huh?

197
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,072
Actually, the best.

198
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,798
I wonder if the restaurant
was crowded.

199
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,512
I sincerely doubt that Frasier
took advantage of that young girl.

200
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,598
Come on, Diane. Frasier's a guy,
no different from the rest of us.

201
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,239
- Yeah.
- There's one difference.

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,517
He's scored since the invention
of the wheel.

203
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,435
It doesn't have to be a big bell
as long as we can hear it.

204
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,189
Trust me.

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,555
He might have taken pity
on that poor girl

206
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,109
and done something
to be nice to her.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,750
Frasier is far too
sophisticated a man

208
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,118
to be swept away
by her transparent charms.

209
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,633
Greetings, one and all.

210
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,236
Say hello to Mrs Frasier Crane.

211
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,795
You're married?

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,598
Well, no.
No, we're not married.

213
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,034
And we won't be for a long time.

214
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,633
An hour.

215
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,914
Yeah, we're gonna tie the knot
right here today

216
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,116
where we met just 16 hours ago.

217
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,157
- That is, if it's okay with you, Sam.
- Yeah.

218
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,436
Sixteen hours
isn't much time, Frasier.

219
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,034
Well, that depends on how
you spend those 16 hours.

220
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,079
Hey, Woody,
some champagne here.

221
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,912
I mean, this is quite an occasion.

222
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,559
I know I'm responsible for that,

223
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,039
but I didn't even see that coming.

224
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,077
The thought never even
crossed my mind.

225
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,748
Thoughts can't cross
your mind, Sam.

226
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,758
The bridge is out.

227
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,796
Okay, well, I would like to
propose a toast, then.

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,150
This is one that my father said
at my wedding,

229
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,839
and it's kind of always
stuck with me.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,594
"Thank God I'm not paying for this."

231
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,914
Thank you. Thank you, all.

232
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,276
Spot.

233
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,429
Look at me.

234
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,194
I'm rumpled and loving it.

235
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,075
Sam, I'll never be able
to thank you enough

236
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,958
for introducing me
to this precious flower.

237
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,111
That goes double for me.

238
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,436
Candi is the perfect girl for me.

239
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,430
I got so tired of thinking
and dating at the same time.

240
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,272
But with Candi, I'm no longer
"Frasier Crane, pompous intellectual."

241
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,637
I'm "Fras, pompous madcap."

242
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,110
And I kind of like him.
Come on, darling.

243
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,714
We'll just stop off at my place
for a quick celebration,

244
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,758
and then we've got a ring to buy before
the justice of the peace arrives.

245
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,353
Oh, Fras?

246
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,957
Just a moment, dear.

247
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,554
What is it, Diane?

248
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,918
I hate what I'm about to say,
and I pray to God it's not true,

249
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,990
but I think you're doing this to draw
me out, to force me to make a stand.

250
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,469
Please, tell me if I'm wrong,
and I'll be forever silent.

251
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,108
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

252
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,834
Yes, you are, Diane.

253
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,999
Okay.

254
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,593
Fine.

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,911
He's lost his mind.

256
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,870
Well, Cliffie, we got time for a wedding
on this evening's agenda?

257
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,316
Yeah, yeah, well, if we put back
the billiards game.

258
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,392
And we gotta miss the first ten minutes
of nighttime Wheel of Fortune.

259
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,109
I hate it when someone throws a
monkey wrench in the works.

260
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,269
No, don't worry, Norm.

261
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
Look, we'll just postpone the
darts game until after the vows.

262
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,355
Yeah? Aren't you forgetting
something, Mr Organizer?

263
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,396
Today's the day when People
magazine comes out.

264
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,232
- Yeah, so?
- So when are we supposed

265
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,039
to black out celebrities' teeth?
Tell me that.

266
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,074
You know, you're not so dumb.

267
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,515
Thank you, Carla.

268
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,588
Frasier's not my cup of tea, but as
husbands go, he could be all right.

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,193
He won't hurt you,

270
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,954
and I think he'll always be faithful.

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,429
And if he isn't, who cares?

272
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,912
That's kind of beautiful.

273
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,433
Yeah.

274
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,998
Dr Crane?

275
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,515
I couldn't be happier for you.

276
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,473
- She is a beautiful girl.
- Thank you, Woody.

277
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,830
My dream is to someday fall in
love with a beautiful girl,

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,718
and for her to fall in love with me.

279
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,793
We get married and have three
wonderful children who grow up,

280
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,509
and move away from us,
and hardly ever write.

281
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,352
She and I would grow old
in an empty house together and die.

282
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,038
I forgot. I also want a boat.

283
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,635
It'll happen for you, Woody.
I know it.

284
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,791
Shall we begin?

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,956
May we all gather down at this end?

286
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,838
My dear?

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,513
You look lovely.

288
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,033
You too, Frasier.

289
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,668
But you know what we're missing?

290
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,829
Music.

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,228
Music. Of course.

292
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,197
Say, anybody play the piano?

293
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,675
I play a little.

294
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,310
Well, get up there, young man,
and regale us with your virtuosity.

295
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,474
Woody? Woody?

296
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,108
I don't think that's quite right
for a wedding.

297
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,438
- It's perfect, senseless. Madcap.
- Yeah.

298
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,637
Frasier would've hated it.
Fras thinks it's swell.

299
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,952
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

300
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,190
to join this man and this woman
in matrimony.

301
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,071
Marriage is a sacred union
not to be entered into lightly.

302
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,114
If there is any person present
who knows a reason

303
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,398
why this couple should not be united,
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

304
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,152
I do.

305
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,709
Right phrase, wrong wedding.

306
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,831
I have to stop this and stop it now.

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,149
There's something I must say.

308
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,594
I've tried to avoid it.

309
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,275
I've tried to hold my peace,
but I can't.

310
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,598
It's urgent. Please.

311
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,830
Sam, help. Let's go, fast.

312
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,717
Listen up, everybody.

313
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,558
We'll be back in a minute here.

314
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,870
In the meantime, you'll be entertained

315
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,190
by the magic fingers
of Mr Woody Boyd.

316
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,159
Frasier, Candi, I apologize
for interrupting

317
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,437
what should be the most
important moment in a person's life.

318
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,310
But I'm compelled to do this by my
affection and respect for both of you.

319
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,875
Isn't it possible, that in the heat
of recent events,

320
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,919
you might be confusing
physical attraction for deeper,

321
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,752
more sublime emotions?

322
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,916
You know, in the
psychiatric profession,

323
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,958
we have a statement for
that little theory of yours:

324
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,396
Frasier.

325
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,273
You have to admit you and Candi
are as different as night and day.

326
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,874
You are as different as Sam and l.

327
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,349
Frasier, hear me out.

328
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,800
We were, as you are,
diametrically opposed personalities.

329
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,238
At first, our differences
were charming to us.

330
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,758
I found Sam's lack of refinement and
sophistication crudely provocative.

331
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,349
Yeah, and I liked the way
her hair smelled.

332
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,999
I'm sure, in addition,
you were excited

333
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,720
by the intellectual vistas
to which I exposed you?

334
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,678
No, I really think
it was that conditioner.

335
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,629
The point I'm trying to make
is that the only thing we had

336
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,633
- was a great physical relationship.
- Yeah, and we had a lot of that.

337
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,552
But when we'd go to concerts,
Sam would be bored stiff,

338
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,029
and I'd be excited, and we'd be
on totally different planes.

339
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,430
Yeah, but we caught the same flight
once we got home

340
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,636
and hit the old Posturepedic.

341
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,678
Don't you see what
you're doing here?

342
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,956
You feel guilty, at least
subconsciously,

343
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,111
for rejecting me,
and that's causing you to act out.

344
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,068
For once in your life, Frasier, put away
your flashcard psychoanalysis

345
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,309
and face the truth.

346
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,511
How dare you insult
my professional acumen!

347
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,829
Here's what I think--

348
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,150
Candi, please, you were not put
on this earth to think.

349
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,834
Diane, you are without a doubt--
Oh, my God.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,718
What have I done?
What have I said?

351
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,472
You said, "l wasn't put
on this earth--"

352
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,709
No, I know what I said.

353
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,230
I just can't believe I said it.

354
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,753
Candi?

355
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,876
I didn't mean it. Please forgive me.

356
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,395
Yes, you did mean it, Frasier.

357
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,959
And what's more, you're right.

358
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,154
You know, I didn't understand
anything anybody was saying

359
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,719
except for Sam.

360
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,598
We can't get married,
because I don't deserve you.

361
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,558
No, no, I don't deserve you.

362
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,757
I don't deserve to put polish
on your toenails.

363
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,753
Although it was the highlight
of breakfast.

364
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,949
Maybe we should spend
more time together

365
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,439
before we take this step.

366
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,390
You mean, like, the weekend?

367
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,239
That long? Well, maybe.

368
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,675
I think you've made
a very wise decision.

369
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,558
I think we'll be going now.

370
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,269
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry I snapped
at you that way.

371
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,237
It's the first time I've raised my voice
to you in anger,

372
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,674
and I promise it'll be the last.

373
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,239
That's too bad.

374
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,757
I thought you were kind of sexy
when you were mad.

375
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,955
Really?

376
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,190
Well, don't just sit there.
Get a move on!

377
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,914
Sam, your office is a pigsty.

378
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,514
- See to it.
- Oh, Frasier.

379
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,955
And you know, if we can put
a man on the moon,

380
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,236
why can't we put metal
in a microwave?

381
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,398
Diane, I gotta compliment you
on the way you handled Frasier.

382
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,675
That was pretty good.

383
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,159
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,915
Yeah, I hate to see a
man and woman make a mistake.

385
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,117
- Frasier and Candi.
- Frasier and Candi. Yeah.

386
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,911
Well, no, no, I mean, you gotta hang
out with somebody for a long time.

387
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,833
You gotta really get to know them
before you take a big step like that.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,639
Yes. If something's worthwhile,
it's worth waiting for.

389
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,831
Absolutely.

390
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,713
Well.

391
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,593
A lot of people out there
waiting for a wedding,

392
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,518
and no bride, no groom.

393
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,954
Guess it's up to us, huh?

394
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,552
My God, Sam.

395
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,553
I can't believe my ears.

396
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,997
You're serious, aren't you?

397
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,555
Oh, no, no.

398
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,551
I just meant that we should
go out there

399
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,039
and serve those people
some drinks.

400
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,189
That's all.

401
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,716
- That's what I meant too.
- No, it isn't.

402
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,591
What did you think
I was talking about?

403
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,633
- Come on.
- Well, for a moment there,

404
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,429
I confess, I thought you were talking
about something else.

405
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,835
And what would your answer
have been?

406
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,513
No, Sam.

407
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,070
That's the sort of question that has to
be asked before it can be answered.

408
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,753
Well, if I heard the answer,

409
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,229
maybe it would be easier
for me to ask the question.

410
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,552
Very well.

411
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,909
The answer is no.

412
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,349
Well, the question was,

413
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,080
"Have you ever met a man who gave
you the hots more than me?"

414
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,756
I'd like to change my answer.

415
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,070
- Fine. Go on.
- Then the answer is yes.

416
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,913
Well, then the question was,
"Do you wanna go to bed with me?"

417
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,433
I wanna change my answer again.

418
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,750
Well, that's okay.
And I'll change my question to,

419
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,516
"ls there any way that you would not
object to not going to bed with me?"

420
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,874
Wait a minute.
