1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,876
Coach, how about a beer?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,232
Sam says I can't serve you.
You're a flimflam.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,353
It ain't for me, it's for a friend.
He asked me to order it for him.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,991
He did.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,556
He wrote it down. "One beer."

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,595
Wait one minute, Harry.
Let me see that.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,191
"One beer." Just had to make sure.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,078
That'll be one buck.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,149
I thought I had a dollar.
I got a ten. You got change?

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,555
Absolutely.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,073
Here you go.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,072
I have a buck after all. I don't
need change. Give me my ten back.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,879
Right.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,673
Here you go.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,909
I don't want to carry all these
bills. Give me a 20 for the lot.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,717
You got it.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,829
Nobody move!

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,077
Coach, don't you see
he's short-changing you?

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,352
No. He's outsmarted me before,
but not this time.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,152
How much are you giving him?

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,477
- 20 bucks.
- How much is he giving you?

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,318
Darn you, Harry!

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,636
Sam, I'm just trying
to keep in practice.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,876
I'll give you a $30 bill,
and we're even.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,955
What do you think?

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,072
- No such thing as a $30 bill.
- Wanna bet?

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,753
Get out of my bar!

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,633
You owe me $10! Is this a clip joint?

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,113
I'm sorry. Here.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,834
You got the wrong idea about me.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,192
I don't. You got ten seconds
to get out. Give me back my watch!

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,995
I'm trying to help you guys out.
If you wanna upgrade...

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,475
Out!

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,358
- Afternoon.
- Hey, Norm!

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,711
Gimme a beer, will you?

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,628
- How's life treating you?
- Like I just ran over its dog.

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,598
You're late. How come?

38
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,990
Vera dragged me to the mortuary
to arrange our funeral.

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,236
Thinking of dying, Norm?

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,559
No date circled yet,
but... Vera likes to plan ahead.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,353
We're gonna get cremated.

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,035
What'll you do with the ashes?

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,115
I wanted to throw them
in her mother's face,

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,950
but I think we'll scatter them
on the Adirondacks.

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,477
- Hello, everyone!
- Hi, Diane!

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,956
Sorry I'm late, but you'll be
delighted when you hear why.

47
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,514
We were delighted you were late!

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,634
I had a fabulous discussion
with my art history professor.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,118
I now feel I have
a full grasp of lmpressionism.

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,673
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,872
Do Kirk Douglas!

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,037
Sam, I'm sorry I was late.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,116
Can I do anything
to make it up to you?

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,391
Yeah... but you wouldn't.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,192
Cheers. Yeah.

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,912
Coach, your friend Walt.

57
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,395
Walt?

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,959
It's good to hear from you!
I'm so glad the operation's over.

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,031
I didn't tell you beforehand, but I
didn't think your chances were good.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,789
It's tomorrow?

61
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,830
Don't worry, you'll fly through it.
It's a piece of cake.

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,590
Hello, everybody.

63
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,870
The famous sportscaster!

64
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,190
- Hi, Coach!
- Right on, man!

65
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,118
We watch you on the news every night.

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,992
Best sports report in town.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,468
What do we have here? Hi.

68
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,273
Dave Richards,
an old team-mate of Sam's.

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,473
Diane Chambers.
I'm Sam's new waitress.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,158
Sam have his brand on you yet?

71
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,838
Hardly.

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,030
Then it's your lucky day.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,789
I'm incredibly good-looking,
incredibly rich and incredibly nice.

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,275
And incredibly married!

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,795
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- You are?

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,835
Yes. I'd hoped to reject you
based solely on your personality.

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,517
Too skinny.

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,312
Can I have Coach buy you a beer?

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,034
- No, I'm here on business.
- I noticed.

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,398
How would you like to be
my interview on the news tonight?

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,238
That's terrific!

82
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,114
Interview me?
I haven't been in baseball for years.

83
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,597
I understand. You're the best
reliever the Red Sox ever had.

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,359
You're still a big name in this town.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,837
- We can do it here in the bar.
- You can't ask for more than that.

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,997
And besides, you owe me a favour.

87
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,712
- I do?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,752
That night in Chicago in 1 973,
with those two young...

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,394
...dollars I borrowed? Yeah.

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,511
Two young dollars?

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,631
Yeah, I hate it
when they're wrinkled.

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,236
I'm out of practice.
It's years since I did an interview.

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,750
Come on, Sam. It's good advertising.
It would help business.

94
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,317
Right. And we can all be on TV.
I'd like to see myself on TV.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,672
No, you wouldn't. Trust me.
Trust me on that.

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,312
Come on. I haven't got all day.

97
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,158
Yeah, come on!

98
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,714
Everybody here
wants you to do the interview.

99
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,796
Almost everybody.

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,072
What do you mean?

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,115
Never mind.

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,830
Excuse me. Diane,
can I talk to you in the back room?

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,474
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,910
I'll be right back.
I have to discipline an employee.

105
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,917
- Can I watch?
- No!

106
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,320
OK, what's the problem?

107
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,510
Why do you think I have a problem?

108
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,279
You've got that "Sam's a chowderhead

109
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,278
and wouldn't understand
if I drew him a picture" look.

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,990
I do get that sometimes.

111
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,629
Sam, you're an ex-jockstrap...

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,830
Ex-jock.

113
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,477
That's ex-jock!
How many times I gotta tell you that?

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,156
What is the origin of the word jock?

115
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,273
I... From the French. Jacques.

116
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,952
Those "Where are they now?"
interviews on TV are depressing.

117
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,231
Any time you put a "former"
in front of a name,

118
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,989
even the most attractive,
bright guy...

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,599
Excuse me. Attractive?

120
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,278
Yeah. Even then...

121
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,039
I didn't know
you thought I was attractive.

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,597
Well, when the light
strikes you in a certain way,

123
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,714
and your hair's combed just right,
and I'm standing back a ways,

124
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,549
you're sometimes
somewhat unrepugnant.

125
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,036
Yeah, that's what women call me.
Tall, dark and unrepugnant!

126
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,720
The point I'm labouring to make here

127
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,073
is that when I see an old athlete
reliving his glory days on TV,

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,714
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

129
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,469
- I don't want to feel sorry for you.
- Feel sorry for me?

130
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,353
I resent that.
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,870
You know
who you should feel sorry for?

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,037
You should feel sorry
for the Flintstones!

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,679
I beg your pardon?

134
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,995
They're opposite
the six o'clock news,

135
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,429
and when people find out
Mayday Malone is on,

136
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,870
Bedrock is gonna be
a very lonely little town!

137
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,193
Martina Navra... No.

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,756
Martina Denavramammajamma... No.

139
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,276
Dave, let's do it!

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,475
Great. Give me 20 minutes.
I'll bring the crew right back.

141
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,513
You got it. It'll give me time
to slip into my shawl and blanket!

142
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,952
- Dave, this is a really good idea.
- Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

143
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,469
About time you got around to Mayday.

144
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,598
I'm really excited
that he agreed to do the interview.

145
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,280
John McEnroe cancelled out on me.

146
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,391
So Sam was your second choice?

147
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,114
No. Gerry Cheever's
out of town with his horses.

148
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,391
- Third?
- ML Carr has laryngitis.

149
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,953
Fourth?

150
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,629
Jim Rice is out of town,
Robert Parish was last week.

151
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,196
And Becky Bannerman, the high
school gymnast, is on a field trip.

152
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,596
But Sam was the first retired guy
you thought of?

153
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,675
No. Well...

154
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,828
I said, Sam was the first
retired guy you thought of!

155
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,190
- The very first.
- He's honoured.

156
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,073
The Celtics got going pretty good,
eh?

157
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,633
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

158
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,479
I'm practising
my floating coin trick.

159
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,431
Pardon me?

160
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,198
Just a little something I do.

161
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,231
So it's a rigged-up coin?

162
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,352
No, it's just a half-dollar. Look.

163
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,389
It's a trick, right?
Strings, wires and stuff?

164
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,590
No wires, no strings.
I take the coin.

165
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,598
I hold it in the air,
about like that.

166
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,915
I let go of it real careful,

167
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,998
and it just stays there, it floats.

168
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,798
It hangs there.

169
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,675
What am I, a goof?

170
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,155
There's no way you can do it!

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,236
You got five bucks if I can't do it?

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,713
Ten! Ten bucks.

173
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,796
Wait. Am I being hustled?

174
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,833
You are gonna give me ten bucks
if I cannot do it?

175
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,837
You're onsville, pal! Come on.

176
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,116
- I couldn't do it!
- No, you couldn't!

177
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,196
- What happened?
- I'll tell you.

178
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,470
You just got stuck with ten bucks.

179
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,837
- Coach! Who is this clown?
- Which clown?

180
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,269
Harry, please!

181
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,713
Harry.

182
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,832
Sam, I'm going. I was just playing.

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,475
But whoever owns a Honda,
thanks for the lift!

184
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,589
Did he take you for anything, Norm?

185
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,556
Sorry? I was practising
suspending this coin in mid-air.

186
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,593
Here.

187
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,790
Carla, I'm fine!

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,754
He's gonna ask you what's
your greatest memory in baseball.

189
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,271
it's gotta be that double header
against the Orioles in '72.

190
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,994
He saved both games
with seven pitches.

191
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,678
Seven pitches.

192
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,315
Wait a minute.
You wanna talk about excitement?

193
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,795
Sam, tell 'em
about opening day in New York.

194
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,914
You come out of the bullpen.
Bobby Mercer's at the plate.

195
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,395
He hit a 400ft home run off me!

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,512
It was the most exciting thing
I ever saw!

197
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,031
Why would Sam wanna talk about
something bad happening to him?

198
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,513
You're right.

199
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,235
Sometimes I think
of the smartest thing to say,

200
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,396
and then it comes out so stupid.

201
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,953
That doesn't make sense.

202
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,799
You should have heard it
before I said it!

203
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,031
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

204
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,873
- Well, Mayday, knock 'em dead.
- Thanks.

205
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,993
- You ready, Sammy?
- Yeah. I am.

206
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,317
Dave, listen. I'd like
to do this, if you don't mind.

207
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,395
Yeah.

208
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,273
We can talk
about my greatest thrill in sport,

209
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,154
then I wanna talk
about my triumph over alcoholism.

210
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,032
Good. Very good.

211
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,549
It could be very powerful.

212
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,116
Then we could talk about Cheers,
what I'm doing now.

213
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,872
And we could talk about what I'd do
about the crisis in the Mideast.

214
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,719
Yeah. The Cubs got that
by three and a half games.

215
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,556
Should be a stimulating evening!

216
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,829
Ready.

217
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,396
A little bit more to the left, guys.

218
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,797
- Roll tape.
- Rolling.

219
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,558
Action!

220
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,355
l'm standing here in a popular
Boston watering hole called Cheers.

221
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,152
What's wrong with his voice?

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,236
Come on, Diane, this is television!

223
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,316
Cut the tape, Ernie.

224
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,238
- Come on, Sam!
- I'm sorry.

225
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,830
- I gotta start over now!
- You'll be alright.

226
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,039
Gee whizz.

227
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,076
- Roll it, Ernie.
- Rolling.

228
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,716
I'm standing in a popular
watering hole called Cheers.

229
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,637
Most of you will recognise
the guy standing next to me.

230
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,513
Maybe you don't
when he's not in his Red Sox uniform.

231
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,312
This is Sam "Mayday" Malone,

232
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,874
ex-relief pitcher
from the Boston Red Sox,

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,797
now owner and bartender at Cheers.

234
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,712
- How you doing, Sam?
- I'm alright, Dave, thanks.

235
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,310
That's great.

236
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,797
You've been out of baseball
for five years. Do you miss it?

237
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,516
I miss the fans. The people
of Boston were very good to me.

238
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,358
Yeah.

239
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,433
Tell us about some of
the great moments you had here.

240
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,314
I guess I'd have to say
one day in Baltimore.

241
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,273
You wanna tell us
a little bit about that, Sam?

242
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,871
Well, I was working both ends
of a double header.

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,197
It's the old story.
First game, bottom of the ninth.

244
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,754
I'm coming in
with a man on second and third.

245
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,917
We're holding on to a one-run lead
against the Birds.

246
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,190
Boog Powell's coming up.

247
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,312
I could feel the wind
from his warm-up swings.

248
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,194
He had the heaviest bat in
the League. Papers were full of him.

249
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,474
I figure the only way to get him is
to challenge him on the first pitch.

250
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,113
If I get cute, he'll kill me.

251
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,199
So I decide I'm gonna make him
wait on me, make him sweat.

252
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,952
I adjust my cap, go down to
the rosin bag, walk around the mound.

253
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,150
When I figure he's getting antsy...

254
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,035
Dave, John McEnroe called. Said he's
got something to get off his chest.

255
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,116
McEnroe.

256
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,916
Dave, what...

257
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,076
Sam, thank you. I'll catch you later.

258
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,150
- What happened?
- I guess he got a better interview.

259
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,510
No. What happened to the Boog person?

260
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,072
He grounded to third.

261
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,795
- Coach, let's serve some drinks.
- Right, Sam.

262
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,638
Tennis is a sissy game.

263
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,638
- Come on. We got thirsty people.
- Damn shame, Sammy.

264
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,113
No sweat.

265
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,708
I'm gonna be in back, cleaning up.

266
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,798
- That's our job, Sam.
- It's my bar, Carla!

267
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,197
Carla, will you watch my customers
while I'm gone, please?

268
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,074
Sure. I'll act geeky,
give 'em the wrong drinks.

269
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,237
- They'll never know you're gone.
- Thanks.

270
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,669
Sam, this could be
a crucial moment in your life.

271
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,032
It's vitally important
you handle your emotions properly.

272
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,709
The worst thing anyone
in a situation like this could do

273
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,070
is to repress his feelings.

274
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,272
Diane, get out, please.

275
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,157
You need to lash out.
To release yourself. Scream.

276
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,068
- Get out!
- Wonderful! Alright.

277
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,877
We need now to move away from brute
emotions into the more cerebral.

278
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,516
Tell me in one sentence what you
perceive to be your problem now.

279
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,029
You won't leave.

280
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,718
Let's come back to that.

281
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,753
Other people have been through
what you're feeling.

282
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,193
Even, in a slightly different way,
myself.

283
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,630
Would you like me to share
an experience from my life

284
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,830
when I was defeated and humiliated?

285
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,397
Diane, I don't wanna hear
a lead in a high school play story.

286
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,876
It's not a lead
in the high school play story.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,390
I don't wanna hear an "I didn't
get asked to the junior prom" story.

288
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,911
It's not an "I didn't get asked
to the junior prom" story.

289
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,874
I sure don't wanna hear an "I didn't
get elected cheerleader" story.

290
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,709
OK, if you're just gonna
make a big joke about it...

291
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,197
I hit it, didn't l?

292
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,436
Sam, I was terrific!

293
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,236
What happened to me today
put a period at the end of my career.

294
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,077
The last thing I need
is a cheerleader right now.

295
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,431
Well, that's what you need the most!

296
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,159
You know, I was looking at you
at that interview today.

297
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,438
I didn't see
a washed-up ex-former has-been.

298
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,193
No, I saw a guy who has a great deal
to look back on with pride.

299
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,953
And a great deal
to look forward to with hope.

300
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,116
Yeah?

301
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,277
It didn't hurt that you
were standing next to a Cro-Magnon.

302
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,959
Sam, here's the point.
You have to put the past behind you.

303
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,753
You have to turn and face the future.

304
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,678
You have to open your eyes,
see what's in front of you.

305
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,031
You're young, you're alive.
Feel that in your whole body.

306
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,312
Appreciate what you've got.
Live for today. Go for it, Sam!

307
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,670
I tell you, go for it!

308
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,559
Are you OK?

309
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,593
Yeah... I'm fine.

310
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,312
Look. One of my lights is out!

311
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,868
It's a reflex I learned in a class.
Practical Feminism.

312
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,513
What was your final?
Crippling a Buick?

313
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,398
I'm sorry I had to do that,

314
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,308
but I came in with honourable
intentions of helping you out.

315
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
No, I'm sorry, you're right.
Thank you.

316
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,591
I really appreciate you coming
in here. High point of my day.

317
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,431
How long have you wanted to do that?

318
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,319
Do what?

319
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,877
Kiss me.

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,560
How long have you denied
that burning desire?

321
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,117
It just came to me.
It was an impulse.

322
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,874
Good, cos if you've been thinking
about anything between us,

323
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,072
- it's out of the question.
- No, I haven't.

324
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,952
Good.

325
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,517
Listen, Diane. Thank you.

326
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,552
I will put the past behind me,

327
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,638
and tomorrow I'll feel better.

328
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,150
But tonight I'm gonna feel bad. OK?

329
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,712
Yeah, OK.

330
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,633
Will you do me a favour?

331
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,517
You want me to try
and take your purse, right?

332
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,156
OK, I deserved that.

333
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,795
No, I'm curious.
I want to hear about the Booger.

334
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,549
- The what?
- The guy from Baltimore.

335
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,312
Listen, I may not have had 80 majors,
but I know when I'm being patronised.

336
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,997
Second game, bottom of the ninth,
Boog's up again...

337
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,317
- Again?
- I'm seeing the clown in my dreams.

338
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,795
See, if I serve him a gopher ball,

339
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,639
we're five games out of
first place with eight to play.

340
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,957
There's only one guy on base,
but it's Don Buford.

341
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,756
He's over there dancing around.
I had to go over there 20 times.

342
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,758
To talk to him about dancing?

343
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,392
No. You see,
you gotta throw the ball to first

344
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,750
to keep the runner close to the bag.

345
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,313
If you don't...

346
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,238
Wait. Don't you throw the ball
at the batter?

347
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,710
Look, this story's going nowhere.
Let's just forget it.

348
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,914
- Good. Now my cheerleader story.
- OK, Buford's on first...

349
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,755
- Where?
- Right there.

350
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,589
Put it down. Easy mistake.
I'll give you another shot.

351
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,631
Gentlemen. One more time, please.

352
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,991
Let me give you a chance
to break even. I feel just terrible!
