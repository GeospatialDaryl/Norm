00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,119
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,721
This is the third time we've
been here in two weeks, Sam.

3
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:08,573
Any idea why you're having
so many fights?

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:11,426
Yeah, yeah, ever since that
biker bar closed down,

5
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:13,061
we're getting these
big apes coming in here.

6
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:14,379
I mean, what are
we supposed to do?

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,063
Be grateful.

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,801
You know something,

9
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,636
if you'd get over here
when I called you,

10
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:24,005
none of this would've happened.

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,740
Oh, oh, look at this.

12
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,441
Woody. Oh, man,
are you all right?

13
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:28,843
Yeah, I'm okay.

14
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:30,980
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

15
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,014
We're gonna have to
file an injury report.

16
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,267
You bet you are.
Tell him, tell him what happened.

17
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,735
Well, I was downstairs
getting a case of scotch,

18
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,971
and there's that
one low beam...

19
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:42,541
What happened here?

20
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,995

Can you believe this guy winning
12 million bucks in the lottery?

28
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:36,344
I... I mean, talk about
beating the odds.

29
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,647
Oh, yeah, you want to talk about
beating the odds,

30
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:41,583
my Uncle Spence fell 20,000 feet
from an airplane

31
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,667
and hit the only pile of hay
for two miles.

32
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,819
Jeez.

33
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,955
He must be the luckiest
man on earth.

34
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:47,989
Well, not really.

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,058
He went through
the propeller first.

36
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:57,715
There's the scariest human being
I've ever seen in my life.

37
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,983
Hmph. Boy. Yeah.

38
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:02,754
Remind me to congratulate
the doctor who created him.

39
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,022
You Sam?

40
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,140
Yeah, that's me.
Are you Tiny?

41
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,508
I'll be right with you.

42
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,043
Uh, Sam, you ought
to think about

43
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,810
wearing those reading
glasses all the time.

44
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,513
That guy's huge.

45
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,348
(chains jingling)

46
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,583
No, no, no, no.

47
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,351
That's his name.
Tiny's his name.

48
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,553
He was the bouncer
at that biker bar.

49
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,655
I figure if we're gonna
have that crowd in here,

50
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,658
I might as well
have him around. What do you think?

51
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,774
Oh, please, Sam.

52
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:26,411
If I promise to feed
him, can I keep him?

53
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,978
Yeah, I'll ask him.

54
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,247
Hey, Tiny, why don't you
fill out this application

55
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,117
so I can start checking
your references.

56
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,067
That's nuts.

57
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,235
Sam's wasting his money.

58
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:36,304
I could have done that job.

59
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:38,773
Sure, I'm taking karate
down at the YW...

60
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,775
The "Y."

61
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:43,844
(chains jingling)

62
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,213
So, Tiny, huh?
(chuckles)

63
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,215
That's a pretty funny nickname
given,

64
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,416
you know, how big you are.

65
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,483
Why?

66
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:51,252
You making fun of my name?

67
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,288
You think I got a joke name?

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,441
Do you think I'm
some kind of joke?

69
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,560
Tell Vera I loved her.

70
00:02:58,561 --> 00:02:59,961
Hey, wait, ho!
Excuse me here.

71
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,429
Tiny there, my main man.

72
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,398
Hey, uh, step into my office.

73
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,032
I'll take care of this, Normie.

74
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,734
You see, Tiny, uh,

75
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,837
you know, calling you "tiny,"
a guy of your, you know, girth,

76
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:13,341
uh, is what we in
the comedy profession call a juxtaposition.

77
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,428
Right?
Yeah. Juxtaposition.

78
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,062
See, it's, uh,

79
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,115
calling a... calling a...
a bald guy "Curly."

80
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,750
Fat guy "Slim."

81
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,386
Tall guy... "Shorty."

82
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,823
I like that.
You're smart.

83
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,692
Why, thank you.

84
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,477
No, that's your new nickname.

85
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,245
Get it?
I made a joke.

86
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,883
And a fine joke it is, too, sir.

87
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,620
Hey, guys.

88
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,422
Now I know you sent me out
for snack food,

89
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,558
but I found this place called
The Healthy Alternative.

90
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,311
Now they have all your favourite
munchies, only organic,

91
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,663
with tofu and soy
and that sort of thing.

92
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:55,449
So I drove right past it,
went to the grocery store,

93
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,152
and got you a big box
of Fiddle Faddle.

94
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,802
Hey.

95
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:04,859
Lilith, I'm so jealous of you.

96
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,294
Excuse me?

97
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,396
Yeah, I-I saw you outside.

98
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,798
After seven years of marriage,

99
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,100
how do you guys keep
your relationship so hot?

100
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,685
I don't know what you mean.

101
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,654
Outside, I saw you in the car.

102
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,489
You were all over him.

103
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,157
Come on, it was great.

104
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,394
You were steaming up the windows
like a couple of teenagers.

105
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:25,163
Well, I've just won
five games in a row.

106
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,544
When you're hot, you're hot.

107
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,667
Oh, hi, Buttercup.

108
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:30,918
Now that's odd.

109
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,822
He's here and I just
saw the two of you

110
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,322
out in the...
Oh, my God.

111
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,709
What's the matter?

112
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,926
Uh, nothing.
Rebecca and I

113
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,495
just have to have
a little talk in the office.

114
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,163
It's private.
Oh, my God!

115
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:43,598
Anything I can help you with?

116
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,567
No, I can handle it ably
on my own.

117
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,998
Well, I'm here if you need me.

118
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,838
Lilith, I don't
want to hear this.

119
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,439
Calm down, Rebecca.

120
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,942
I've got enough to deal with
without you going berserk on me.

121
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,509
Yes, that was me
you saw in the car,

122
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,746
and, obviously, the man
with me was not Frasier.

123
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,330
Lilith, you are
having an affair!

124
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,381
It isn't an affair.

125
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,933
It was a one-time fling.

126
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,468
I've been working side by side
with this man for months,

127
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:06,171
and I'm afraid
our latent desires

128
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,705
just got the better of us.

129
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:08,989
It's the old story.

130
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,725
One moment we were
feeding the lab rats

131
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,995
and the next thing we knew,
we were in a hotel room.

132
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:19,150
What you saw was me saying
good-bye to him.

133
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,701
Well, then he must be
hard of hearing.

134
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,770
You had his ear in your mouth.

135
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,007
We both know it was a mistake.

136
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,859
It will never happen again.

137
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,378
What are you gonna do now?

138
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,247
Well, there's only
one thing I can do.

139
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,682
I have to tell Frasier.

140
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,985
Now, until I find the time
to tell him in my own way,

141
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,254
you must promise me

142
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,639
you're not going to say
anything to him about this.

143
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,241
Well, how the hell
am I gonna do that?

144
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,560
What?

145
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,895
Because this is juicy stuff.

146
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:48,896
The more I'm sitting
here thinking

147
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:49,947
that I should keep
my mouth shut,

148
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:51,065
the more I want to
just go out there

149
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,134
and blab it all over.

150
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,169
I know that's wrong,
but it's just me.

151
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,271
Please, Rebecca, you'll only
have to control yourself

152
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:58,372
for a little while.

153
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,807
Frasier and I are
going to have dinner

154
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,308
with another couple
up at Melville's,

155
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:03,911
and as soon as it's over,
I'll break it to him.

156
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,180
Lilith, you have
a big problem. Yes, I know.

157
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:09,567
My entire marriage
is on extremely shaky ground.

158
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:10,970
No, I mean you only have
about an hour

159
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,186
until I blow.

160
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,699
Hi. Welcome to Cheers.

161
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,135
You want to feel
the plate in my head?

162
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,071
I can make it move.

163
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,923
No, uh, we're just
looking for friends,

164
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,891
and, uh, they're not here.
So, bye.

165
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:38,612
Sammy, that's guy's making me
a little nervous, okay?

166
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:40,349
What're you talking about?
The guy's great.

167
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,334
He's already stopped two fights,
keeping everybody in line.

168
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:46,225
Best of all, he thinks minimum
wage is two dollars an hour.

169
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:51,091
Wow, you're cheating him
out of 50 cents an hour?

170
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,029
Boy, I'll tell you,
having Tiny in this bar

171
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,330
is about the most exciting thing

172
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,500
that's happened around here
in a long time.

173
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,102
Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

174
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:03,988
No, I-I think the most
exciting thing, uh,

175
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,456
contrary to your belief, Carla,

176
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,925
was when, uh, Sammy fiddled
around with the cable box

177
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,527
and we were able to get
The Playboy Channel

178
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:11,362
all day long, huh?

179
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,781
Well, you know, some people
who didn't know any better

180
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:17,284
might think that
that was interesting.

181
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,853
Well, how about, uh, last week

182
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,604
when Phil told us
that he did time?

183
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,858
Now that was juicy.

184
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:24,959
Yeah.

185
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,544
Oh, yeah, real juicy.

186
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:30,714
(scoffs) I don't think so.

187
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,534
What are you trying
to say, Rebecca?

188
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,203
I'm trying to say
that I have got major dish

189
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,971
bottled up inside me.

190
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,806
And it's just dying to get out.

191
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:41,309
Oh, God, here it comes.
I can feel it.

192
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:43,143
It's coming up
through my chest.

193
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,562
I can feel it in my throat.

194
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,834
It's...

195
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,436
(mumbling)

196
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,994
So, Phil, what did
you do time for?

197
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,580
I held up a Piggly Wiggly.

198
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,118
Can I now get on with my life,
please?

199
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,258
Is the, uh, TV too loud
for you folks?

200
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,793
SAM:
Tiny?

201
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,428
The TV's not actually on.

202
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:22,199
Then why do I keep hearing
the Kill 'Em, Tiny show?

203
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,124
Sammy, you heard that.

204
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,560
The guy is nuts.

205
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,628
Oh, yeah, maybe you're right.

206
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:34,896
Maybe I should just, you know,
talk to him.

207
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,397
Tiny, could I talk to you
for a second?

208
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,182
Yo!

209
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,734
How you doing?

210
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:40,935
Oh, great, Sam.

211
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,436
Listen, and don't you worry.

212
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,606
There won't be any trouble
in here while I'm around.

213
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,474
I just hope somebody tries.

214
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,209
Do you want me to tell
you what I'm gonna do

215
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,744
if somebody starts
some trouble?

216
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,412
Uh, no, actually,

217
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,447
I don't think
I want to hear that, man.

218
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:57,151
Okay, but I did
draw you a picture.

219
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,272
Well, how can I...

220
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,608
Oh, my God.

221
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,476
Uh...

222
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,778
So, uh, did you want
to tell me something?

223
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,349
No, well, no, no,
uh, just, uh, carry on.

224
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,084
Carry on.
Okay.

225
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,423
Carla...

226
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,158
look what this guy drew.

227
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,859
That's nothing.

228
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,161
I got worse than that
on my refrigerator.

229
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,482
Here is my question.

230
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:29,851
Now I had the seafood salad.

231
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:32,319
You had the poached salmon.

232
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,555
Neither of us
had any appetizers.

233
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,590
They had appetizers and soup

234
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,626
and the lobster special,

235
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,594
and yet we split the
meal fifty-fifty.

236
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,159
Now, am I wrong, or did
we just get royally ripped?

237
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,749
Frasier, we need to talk.

238
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,001
You're darned right we do.
I don't know

239
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,136
if I want them
as friends anymore.

240
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,787
No, I mean I have
to tell you something

241
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:50,921
that's rather serious.

242
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,256
What is it, Lilith?
In fact,

243
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:54,692
I dare say you're gonna
find it extremely upsetting.

244
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:55,743
All right.

245
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:57,428
Well, I think we should
discuss it at home.

246
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,296
No, no, no, Lilith,
you just don't tell someone

247
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:01,532
that you're going to upset them
and then just let them dangle.

248
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,967
Whatever it is,
just tell me right now.

249
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,635
I'll be upset,
then I'll get over it.

250
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,037
We can go on with our lives.

251
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,905
Please, let's just go home.

252
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,640
No, Lilith, I want to know

253
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:10,541
right now.

254
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,543
All right, if you
must know immediately,

255
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:13,877
I'll tell you.

256
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,712
Have a seat.

257
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,081
Oh, great.

258
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,550
It's... It's "have a seat" bad.

259
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,920
Just-Just

260
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,522
give me a minute to,
uh, to brace myself.

261
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:29,526
Uh, I know, I'll simply
imagine the worst thing

262
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:30,928
you could possibly tell me,

263
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,999
and whatever your news is,
it will pale by comparison.

264
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,653
In fact, whatever it is,
it... it'll be a relief.

265
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,304
Okay, okay, uh...

266
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,524
what is the worst thing
I can imagine?

267
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,309
All right, I've got it.

268
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,461
Lilith, your news, please.

269
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,699
This afternoon,

270
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:55,102
in a moment
of extreme weakness...

271
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,456
I cheated on you.

272
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,957
That was it!

273
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,425
That was the worst thing!

274
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,793
Try to remain calm.

275
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,994
How can I remain calm

276
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,896
when you tell me you
slept with another man?!

277
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,131
You slut!

278
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,139
I-I... I can't
believe that.

279
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,978
I knew the whole time.

280
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,731
I have known it
for over an hour.

281
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,801
And I didn't say
a word to anybody.

282
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:29,837
(singsongy):
I kept a secret. I kept...

283
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,489
Tragic, isn't it?

284
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,141
You're still angry, aren't you?

285
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,043
How can you tell?

286
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,412
The fact that this park bench
used to be chained

287
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,649
to that cement block next to
the statue of George Washington.

288
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,285
I wanted to be alone.

289
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,742
This is a very serious
matter, Frasier.

290
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:11,278
Yes, it is serious, Lilith.

291
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:15,015
However, I will refrain from
indulging in clichéd reactions...

292
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,818
rage, the crying,
the screaming,

293
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,070
the hurling of epithets:

294
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,674
Tramp, whore, slut, floozy,
bitch, ad infinitum.

295
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,595
You did call me slut.

296
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,231
Yes, but I didn't call you a
tramp, whore, floozy or bitch.

297
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,333
I have too much
respect for you...

298
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,402
even though you have
been a slut.

299
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,840
Of course you deserve to know

300
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,842
everything that happened
and why.

301
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,277
Look, all I want
to know is who.

302
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:44,678
Who it is doesn't matter.

303
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,280
This is about us.

304
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,666
The identity of the other
person is irrelevant.

305
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,918
Fine, Lilith, I respect that.

306
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:54,288
It'll be just one more
secret between us.

307
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,356
One more brick in the wall.

308
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,243
All right.

309
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,979
It was my colleague,

310
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:05,949
the distinguished research
scientist, Dr. Louis Pascal.

311
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,768
The bald guy?!

312
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,102
Frasier...

313
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,605
I never meant to hurt you.

314
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,426
But for so long now
I have felt so alone.

315
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,228
It seems we can't talk without
getting into a fight.

316
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:21,298
Even the smallest conversation
erupts into bickering.

317
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,051
It just goes on every...
Oh, I can see what's going on here.

318
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,020
I can't believe I didn't
think of this sooner.

319
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,254
I'm such a dope.

320
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,689
What are you talking about?

321
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:30,991
You're in your
mid-30s, right? Yes.

322
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,459
It's perfectly natural for you

323
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,270
to be examining
your life right now.

324
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,525
You are comparing
the expectations you had

325
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:37,831
of yourself in the past

326
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:39,667
with what you've actually
achieved up to now.

327
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,435
Frasier, that...
No, no, wait.

328
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:42,503
Wait, let me finish.

329
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:44,171
And how many years
have we been married?

330
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,723
Seven.

331
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,508
The perfect time for you

332
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,277
to be re-examining
our relationship.

333
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:52,046
You're practically a cliché.

334
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,914
Frasier, I am not a cliché.

335
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,517
I'm talking about something... Oh, please,
you got hit with the old double whammy.

336
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:59,252
Of course you had a fling.
And why wouldn't you?

337
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,606
Thank God. For a while I thought
we had a problem.

338
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,407
Frasier, you're not
listening to me.

339
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,109
"You're not listening to me."
Right out of the textbook.

340
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,695
I can't tell you
how annoying this is. Of course you can.

341
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,331
Volumes have been written on how
annoying analysis can get.

342
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,965
Frasier, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

343
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,168
This is our marriage
we're talking about.

344
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:15,635
Our lives.

345
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,839
Stop being a psychiatrist
and start being my husband.

346
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:25,312
All right, Lilith.

347
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,280
I'll be your husband.

348
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,482
(distant bell tolling)

349
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,457
But for seven years now

350
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:40,627
we've tried to build
something together,

351
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,730
and I think we've done
a pretty good job.

352
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not worth throwing
it all away on something

353
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,986
so empty, meaningless
and unfulfilling.

354
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,121
Actually...

355
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,023
I don't want to hear it!

356
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,393
Frasier, don't you
see that this incident

357
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,131
is symptomatic of
much larger problems?

358
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,850
We can work on that.

359
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:05,486
We owe it to our marriage.

360
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,288
But you must march over
to Pascal

361
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:10,240
and tell him,
in no uncertain terms,

362
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:13,059
that you will never
see him again.

363
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:17,431
Very well.

364
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,733
I'll go now.

365
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,871
Certainly you're being
very rational about this.

366
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,357
Very civilized.

367
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:30,210
Well, I'm... I'm nothing
if not civilized.

368
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,697
By the way,

369
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,500
this Pascal, is he married?

370
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,052
No.

371
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:39,587
Why?

372
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:43,540
I thought I could bag his wife,
even the score.

373
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,594
I'm sorry. I'm venting.

374
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,279
Go.

375
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,224
Oh, people. Sheesh.

376
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,444
Think they'd never seen
a blowtorch scar before.

377
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:04,829
Wow.

378
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,848
Who took a blowtorch to you?

379
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:08,849
I did.

380
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,984
I let myself down.

381
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:11,518
Nobody lets Tiny down.

382
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,656
Sammy, you've gotta
get rid of that guy.

383
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:16,807
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

384
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,041
You're right,
you're right. Let him come.

385
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,242
I'll fire him.

386
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,715
Say, um... Tiny?

387
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,517
Could you step over
here for a second?

388
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,169
Oh.
Um...

389
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,237
Listen, I want to talk to
you about the job for a minute.

390
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:31,672
I want you to know

391
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,108
it's not that we don't
like having you here.

392
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:37,011
It-It's just
that, uh, well...

393
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,262
Knock, knock.

394
00:16:42,353 --> 00:16:44,402
I'm sorry. What?

395
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,669
Knock, knock.

396
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,572
Who's there?

397
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,923
The dead guy.

398
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,777
Oh, boy.

399
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,248
The, uh, dead guy who?

400
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,542
The dead guy that I killed.

401
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,816
Get it?

402
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:07,124
I thought I heard 'em all, man.

403
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,709
Oh...

404
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:11,512
So, uh, what were you
saying about the job?

405
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,997
Uh, well, it was just that, uh,

406
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,884
we-we were all...
talking and,

407
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:19,637
uh...

408
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,273
we have decided, uh, to make
you the Employee of the Month.

409
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,076
Thank you.

410
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,211
Yeah, all right.

411
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,479
All right, thanks.

412
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,314
Sam, what gives?

413
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,950
I've been working my butt off
for you for seven years,

414
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,481
and you're making Tiny the
Employee of the Month?

415
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,954
Not, not now, man.

416
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,323
I-I'm trying to think of
a way to get rid of him.

417
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:42,293
Boy, you are one fickle guy.

418
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,261
All right, all right, please,

419
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,029
please, help me,
help me out here.

420
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,230
Excuse me, excuse me. Wait.

421
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,166
Can I just be the voice
of reason here

422
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,386
and suggest that we keep Tiny.

423
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,155
Personally, I think he's
a welcome addition

424
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,640
to the Cheers family.

425
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,477
Please, we gotta
do this, Carla.

426
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,145
I get it. This is
an ego thing, huh? Right?

427
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,348
A handsome man comes
into this bar,

428
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:07,985
and you just can't
stand it, can you?

429
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,437
Wait, hold it.
I've got an idea.

430
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:11,772
I got an idea.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

431
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,357
Listen, come here.
What we do

432
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,091
is we tell him
that Cheers was built

433
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,728
on an ancient burial ground
and we scare him out of here.

434
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CLIFF: Wait, wait, no,

435
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,748
I got one, I got one.

436
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,950
No, no, listen,
this is very popular nowadays.

437
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,035
Tell him we have radon gas,
very deadly,

438
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,705
seeping up through the
floorboards, and we're all goners anyway.

439
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,072
Yeah, okay, what
about a bomb threat?

440
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,542
What about treating him like
a human being with feelings?

441
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,276
No, that-that
would nev...

442
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:36,847
Oh, man,

443
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,049
I'm sorry.
We never, we...

444
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,218
Uh, I'm big, not deaf.

445
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,020
I'll go now.

446
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,155
Nice working with you folks.

447
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,382
(laughing) Hey!

448
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,718
Whoo! Yeah!

449
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,987
Greetings, all.

450
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:00,771
Hey, Frasier.

451
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,039
What can we get you?

452
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:04,241
Oh, uh, just a scotch,
please, Sam.

453
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,610
Boy, what a day I've had.

454
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,045
I'd like to unwind.

455
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,413
I think I've earned it.

456
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,283
Well, coming
right up, Dr. Crane.

457
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,823
No, I've really
earned it, Woody.

458
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:26,079
I mean, this was a real bad day.

459
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,467
I'll tell you when
to stop, Woody.

460
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,891
(glass pounding)

461
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,443
(slurring):
One more, Woody.

462
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,779
One more for the...

463
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,581
the big stooge.

464
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,418
One more for the big loser.

465
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,420
One more for the big boob.

466
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,021
Hey, hear that?

467
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,624
Frasier wants to buy
you guys a drink.

468
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:59,379
Woody, Woody, come to me
for a moment here.

469
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:04,367
Listen, when you go
home tonight...

470
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:05,552
to your wife Kelly,

471
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:08,856
(voice breaking):
You treat her right.

472
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,407
You promise me.

473
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,309
Treat her right.

474
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,345
Hell of a woman.

475
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,314
If I wasn't married, I'd be all
over her like white on rice.

476
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:23,921
That perky little
caboose of hers.

477
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,241
There you go.

478
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:28,575
What's this?

479
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,661
That's, uh,
black coffee on the house.

480
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:33,363
Very generous.

481
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,466
You guys are true friends

482
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,751
to stand by me
in my hour of need.

483
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:39,870
Fras, come on, we all know
what you're going through.

484
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,072
Oh, oh, do you, Norm?

485
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,009
What if you found out Vera
was sleeping with another man?

486
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,226
Yeah, right.

487
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,179
And what if it rained beer?

488
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:53,249
I want you all to know
I'm not blaming her.

489
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,854
It's because of me that my life
is in the arms of another man.

490
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,690
Uh, well, you mean "wife,"
don't you, Dr. Crane?

491
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,075
What?
You said "life."

492
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,445
"It's because of me my life
is in the arms of another man."

493
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:07,197
Oh, that's a-that's a
Freudian slip there, Woody.

494
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,431
What's a Freudian slip?

495
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,234
Oh, that's when you say
one thing

496
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:13,737
when you're actually thinking
about a mother.

497
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,542
Frasier?

498
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,997
I need to speak
with you in private.

499
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:26,199
Oh, no, you don't.

500
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:29,053
I want everyone here to hear
what I've got to say to you.

501
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,971
Lilith, I realize

502
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,641
that it is I and not
you who are to blame.

503
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:36,810
Whatever you've done,

504
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:40,347
I'm sure I gave you
ample reason for it.

505
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:44,284
I've been...
arrogant, overbearing,

506
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,553
selfish, self-absorbed.

507
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,721
I've spent way too much
time in this place.

508
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:50,991
I really think we should go
somewhere else to discuss this.

509
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,526
No, Lilith, so you
had a fling? So what?

510
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,162
I've put all that behind me.

511
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,382
I forgive you.

512
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,635
And I-I take you back
with open arms.

513
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:04,388
I'm sorry, Frasier.

514
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,940
I wanted to break it
off with Dr. Pascal,

515
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:09,092
but I'm afraid it's
more serious than I thought.

516
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,945
I think I'm in love with him.

517
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,330
And... I'm leaving you.

518
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:25,175
Oh, this is twice today

519
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,861
that I publicly
made a fool of myself.

520
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:30,547
Oh, you get used to it, Doc.
