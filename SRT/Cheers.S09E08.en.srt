Young man, a beer, please.

3
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:14,271
        Hey... you're on
 Sunday morning TV, aren't you?

4
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,371
            Indeed.

5
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:17,571
                    Are you, uh,
                 David Brinkley?

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,370
          No.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,870
                  Sam Donaldson?

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,570
        Give me a break.

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,269
                    Oh!

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,169
              Aren't you the guy
          who keeps the Gorgeous
             Ladies of Wrestling

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,968
            from tearing each
            other's hair out?

12
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:31,168
You <i>could</i> say that.

13
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:33,468
        Oh, man! Your money's
                no good here.

14
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:34,968
Actually,

15
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,267
I'm John McLaughlin--
I'm the moderator

16
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:40,467

called <i>The McLaughlin Group.</i>

        ¶ Taking a break
    from all your worries ¶

22
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:01,063
¶ Sure would help a lot

23
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:04,963
      ¶ Wouldn't you like
         to get away? ¶

24
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:08,562
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go

25
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:13,062
    ¶ Where everybody
    knows your name ¶

26
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:18,961

38
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:06,853
         Good evening.

39
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:08,553
     Welcome to <i>Cheers 200.</i>

40
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,152
      I'm John McLaughlin.

41
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:12,652
         A little more
     than eight years ago,

      <i>a pseudo-intellectual</i>
         <i>college student</i>

00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,051
     <i>walked into a bar</i>

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,550
             Hello?

46
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,050
              Sam?

47
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,049
          Are you Sam?

48
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,249
         (mouth full):
              Yes.
Yes, he's here.

49
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,549
      Someone named Vicky.

50
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:34,348
             No, no, no, no, no.

51
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:36,948
No. She knows you're here.

52
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,548
    I told her you're here.

53
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:40,747
            Well...

54
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,047
          Now, look...

55
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,147
        (mumbling)

56
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,247
    I'm sorry. I was wrong.

57
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,246
      He had to step out.

58
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:48,846
             Where?

59
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,746
Well, um...

60
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:53,945
I think what happened is,
        he, uh....

61
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:55,045
He had t...

62
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,344
  he had to go to mime class.

63
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:05,143
     That week, America was
    supremely uninterested.

64
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:08,043
     <i>Cheers</i> ranked #77

65
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:11,742
    out of a possible
      77 television shows.

66
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,442
        (laughter)
          Last season,

67
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,941
 it was the #1 television show
          in America.

68
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,341
     On this, the occasion

69
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:22,041
of the 200th episode of <i>Cheers,</i>

70
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:25,040
    we will be showing
  some of the many highlights,

71
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,139
         and lowlights,
of the first 199 episodes,

72
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,239
    as well as talking

73
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,339
 to the originators, the cast,

74
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,438
and the current caretakers

75
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:39,838
  of the little bar in Boston
where everybody knows your name.

76
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,937
      We'll be right back.

77
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:45,237
It's like I'm
in complete control
of people's destinies.

78
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:48,036
                    Oh, yeah?
     Yeah, like, I can make
    their drinks too strong

79
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,636
    so they get sick.
                         Uh-huh.

80
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:53,036
 Or, uh, I can water 'em down,
 so they're paying for nothing.

81
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,635
                      Yeah.
Or if I don't like

82
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,335
        their attitudes,
    I can spit in it.

83
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:58,735
            (laughs)

84
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,633
 Carla, you're not still upset

85
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:10,533
about that little argument
     we had the other day?

86
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,432
          You tell me.

87
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,730
  Oh, uh, hey, Carla, listen,
  I'm sorry about this morning

88
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,529
    when I called you
      a "sawed-off witch."

89
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:39,728
            PEOPLE:
              <i>Norm!</i>

90
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,328
George, you want to tell us
about Norm Peterson?

91
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:44,727
Well, uh, he hangs out in a bar.

92
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,827
        (laughter)
        He, uh...

93
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:50,426
 he's got darned good writers.

94
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:51,626
     Afternoon, everybody.

95
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,626
                            ALL:
                        Norm!

96
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,025
                What's up, Norm?
          My nipples--
    it's freezing out there.

97
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,125
What are you up to, Norm?

98
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:02,324
        My ideal weight,
    if I were 11 feet tall.

99
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:07,723
Hey, Mr. Peterson, Jack Frost
          nippin' at  your nose?

100
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:11,923
  Yeah. Now let's get Joe Beer
nippin' at my liver, huh?

101
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,022
 What's going on, Mr. Peterson?

102
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,222
    Let's talk about what's
     going <i>in</i> Mr. Peterson.

103
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:19,722
  Hey, what's happening, Norm?

104
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:21,821
        Well, it's
  a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy,

105
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,121
                 and I'm wearing
            Milk Bone underwear.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
    Norm's a very loyal guy.

107
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,019
 Unfortunately, his priorities
 are a little bit out of whack.

108
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,919
        (clears throat):
  He's loyal to the bar first,

109
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,618
    and, uh, you know,
    to his marriage...

110
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:43,018
    somewhere down the line,
        but he is loyal.

111
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,317
You can't go sneaking out nights
     on somebody you love.

112
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,217
        Woody, you have
  to believe that truth and...
Norm, it's Vera.

113
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:53,116
I'm not here-- honesty are
the cornerstones of a marriage.

114
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,516
        I promised Vera
 I'd pick up some Chinese food.

115
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:56,816
    Oh, that's nice
     of you, Norm.

116
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:01,015
    Well, I spilled it
on the floor this morning.

117
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:04,414
                  Sheesh! Women.

118
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,714
        You can't live with 'em.
             Pass the beer nuts.

119
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:13,113
Hey, Norm, how come you and Vera
      never had any kids?

120
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:14,913
        I can't, Coach.

121
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:16,412
     Gee, I'm sorry, Norm.

122
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,612
 I look at Vera, I just can't.

123
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,911
    See you in the morning,
         I guess, huh?

124
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:25,311
 Yeah, I may be a little late.

125
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:28,010
        Oh, that's okay.
    I had a key made.

126
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,410
    I came, I drank...

127
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,209
        I stayed.

128
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,909
        (laughter)

129
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,409
                    (deep groan)

130
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,009
What's the matter, Norm?

131
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,708
                    Aw, nothing.
              Just my shorts are
            binding up on me.

132
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:53,606
    Just, uh, you know, stand up
and straighten 'em out a little.

133
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:57,106
Nah. I'll give 'em five minutes.
    Sometimes they self-correct.

134
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:04,005
             CARLA:
 <i>I've been down this road</i>
       <i>a few times myself,</i>

135
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:05,804
     <i>and take it from a pro:</i>

136
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,504
              there is one thing
        you always have to do

137
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,104
        before you tell a guy
                you love him.

138
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:11,903
What's that?
              Lose the mustache.

139
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,602
Rhea, tell us about Carla.

140
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,802
  Well, she's, um, a survivor.

141
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:23,901
        She's a realist.

142
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,901
She's very fertile.

143
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,201
        (laughter)

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,600
      I cannot let any man
touch me, talk to me or see me,

145
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,599
  or I'll be shooting out kids
     like a Pez dispenser.

146
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,198
 Do you think that she's mean?

147
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:43,898
 No. I don't think she's mean.

148
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,498
I think that she's honest.

149
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,298
Frasier, you're brilliant!

150
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:49,497
That is one of
the most brilliant ideas

151
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:51,797
you've ever had, and you've had
a lot of brilliant ideas.

152
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,097
    Thank you, Carla.

153
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,097
     See, Woody? It works.

154
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,296
      Bonehead bought it.

155
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,596
                Nothing wrong
                  with sweating.

156
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,195
         I myself have perspired
                  once or twice.

157
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,995
    We could grow rice.

158
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:08,194
Give me a little something
with hair on it.

159
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,194
Here I am.

160
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,693
So, uh,

161
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:15,593
you married?

162
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:16,993
             Yes, quite happily.

163
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:19,692
Too bad. Could've been
my first Englishman.

164
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,192
Oh, no, no, no, wait.

165
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,092
There was that one other guy,
but he was so white,

166
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:25,991
I kept losing him
in the sheets.

167
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,991
Does everybody
like Carla?

168
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:31,290
                    Oh, yeah.
        Oh, yeah.

169
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,790
                    You have to.

170
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,990
        (laughter)

171
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,789
 Did Carla like Diane Chambers?

172
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,489
        (laughs):
              No.
No?

173
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:40,589
    Suffice it to say,

174
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:44,188
 he insists on making mountains
    out of molehills.

175
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,388
      He wants you to wear
         a padded bra?

176
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:52,187
        I can no longer
        hold my tongue.

177
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,487
            Want me to do it?

178
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,186
     He has saved hundreds,
         nay, thousands

179
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,586
of troubled marriages.

180
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:05,385
 It's even rumored that he had
a hand in helping Chuck and Di.

181
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,284
    Speaking of that,
 why don't <i>you</i> upchuck and die?

182
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,384
    Do you like Cliff?

183
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,784
              No.

184
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:15,283
McLAUGHLIN:
You don't like Cliff?
No.

185
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:18,283
It's a little known fact that
42% of all deaths in America

186
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,582
are caused by accidents
in the home.

187
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:22,082
                    So were you.

188
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:26,382
         Yeah, you'd never catch
                 a woman of mine

189
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,881
            leading me around
                    by the nose.

190
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,881
No, but you might catch her
sunning herself on a rock.

191
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,480
What a pathetic display.

192
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm ashamed God
made me a man.

193
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,779
I don't think God's doing a lot
 of bragging about it, either.

194
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:45,079
             CLIFF:
 <i>If you go back in history</i>

195
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:46,978
 <i>and, uh, take every president,</i>

196
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,878
        you'll find that
      the numerical value

197
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:51,078
         of each letter
    in their last name

198
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,877
     was equally divisible
         into the, uh,

199
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,677
year in which they were elected.

200
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,277
        All right.

201
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:57,477
CLIFF:
See,

202
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,476
I figured it out,
and by my calculations,

203
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,776
uh, our next president
has to be named...

204
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,975
Yelnick McWaWa.

205
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,675
      Who is Cliff Clavin?

206
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,074
          Well, Cliff,
  according to Cliff, would...

207
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:15,274
he'd be the wing nut that holds
 Western civilization together.

208
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,473
        (laughter)
        He, uh...

209
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:22,173
        according to me,
he'd just be a winged nut.

210
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,072
      You know, you've got
      a big mouth, Clavin.

211
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:28,371
Hey, he happens to be
right, you know.

212
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,871
Yeah, it's a genetic quirk
in the, uh, Clavin family

213
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,871
that we all have
two extra teeth.

214
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:35,470
Uh, you see, that's the
only way that we can prove

215
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,370
that we are the rightful heirs
to the Russian throne.

216
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,869
          Hello in there, Cliff.

217
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,268
          Tell me, what color is
          the sky in your world?

218
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:50,368
    You know, I, uh...

219
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:54,067
      I happen to be a bit
of an expert on tapeworms.

220
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,167
        It all goes, uh,
        it all goes back

221
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,467
to my eighth-grade science fair.

222
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,866
  You know, everybody else had
    rabbits and guinea pigs.

223
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:02,366
    I, uh, had a tapeworm.

224
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,266
            Really?

225
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,866
         Yeah, so I couldn't go.

226
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,965
          Or was that, uh,
        was that a ringworm?

227
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:12,564
         Check, please.

228
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:15,264
Yeah, boy, boy, boy...

229
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,863
Me and parasites--
don't get me started.

230
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:21,263
John, is there, is there
a part of you in Cliff?

231
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:25,162
Oh, yeah, I, I, I am fascinated
  by fascinating facts, yeah.

232
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:26,862
Is there a part
of Cliff in you?

233
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:28,262
    Uh, I wear white socks.

234
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:30,061
        (laughter)

235
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,761
                        NORM:
                         Well...

236
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,361
CLIFF:
Yeah...
          I tell ya...

237
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,060
                    Is that, uh,

238
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,460
    Cliff Clavin or is
    that Don Ho, huh?

239
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,760
        Ah...

240
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,960
        Where ya been, buddy?

241
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,959
            Some, uh, faraway
                  island resort?

242
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,559
Oh, easy mistake,
Norm, but, no,

243
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,259
I got this tan right
here in Beantown.

244
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,558
    Is that at the new, uh,

245
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,558
 Tan and Wash I've been hearing
      so dang much about?

246
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:52,758
     That's right, Normie.

247
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:54,258
And by the way, did you realize

248
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,657
that the tan first gained
        popularity

249
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,857
      in what is now known
    as the Bronze Age?

250
00:11:57,857 --> 00:11:59,557
                Great, great,
                 well, I'm sold.

251
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,456
Oh, and, by the way, uh,
look how white I used to be.

252
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:09,555
          McLAUGHLIN:
      <i>During the course of</i>
     <i>the history of</i> Cheers,

253
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,455
you lost a character.

254
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,155
You lost a man.
        Right.

255
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,954
Nick Colasanto,
who played the part

256
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:19,254
of Ernie Pantuso,
the Coach.

257
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,053
 Uh, Nickie was like a father.
    I mean, he came...

258
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:22,753
    He was the father
      and Woody's the kid.

259
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:25,952
    I mean, that was, uh...
Nicky was the... the sage.

260
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:28,452
         He used to say
 he used to play the character

261
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:29,652
      like a 12-year-old.

262
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,352
    He would sit and listen

263
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,851
  to everybody like they made
        complete sense.

264
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,451
        I, I don't know
      if you know the set,

265
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:36,951
        but he's still,
      he's still present.

266
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,150
  We put a picture of Geronimo

267
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,650
         that Nicky had
     in his dressing room,

268
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,050
we put that on the upstage wall
        of <i>Cheers</i>

269
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,549
so he's, uh, he's still present
        and, uh...

270
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,349
He was a former coach
in professional baseball?

271
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:49,249
He was Sam's coach, yeah.

272
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,548
  He had a record in the minor
  league being hit by a pitch

273
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:53,348
         more than any
        other person...
(laughs)

274
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:55,148
    I mean, what I'd do was,

275
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,947
                I'd get up there
                and lean my body

276
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,347
     into the pitch, right?

277
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:01,747
And, well, sometimes I took one
 right in the old melon, but...

278
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,546
             I mean, I really...

279
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,346
    I really made a science
        out of it.

280
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,146
              I became a master.

281
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,445
                 Well, here, try
                     to miss me.
              Oh.

282
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:12,445
                      You ready?

283
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,145
            Okay, here we go.

284
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,144
I'm not gonna get it
anywhere near him.

285
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,944
    That's the whole point.

286
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,643
                     (soft thud)

287
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:25,243
(gasps)

288
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:27,442
              Oh!

289
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:28,742
                          COACH:
                I'm on my way
                    to first!

290
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,142
     Whoo!

291
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,142
    Nicky was amazing.
      He was a director...

292
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:34,841
          Accomplished director,
                      teacher...

293
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,041
    A very, very bright man,

294
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:38,441
      and he would, like,
he would drive on the lot,

295
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:40,740
        and he, he'd say
  that he'd get out of his car

296
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
 and he'd, psst, turn that off.

297
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,040
And then, pshew, he was...
he was Coach from then on.

298
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,639
            Cheers.

299
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:47,639
    Yeah, just a sec.

300
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,639
Is there an Ernie Pantuso here?

301
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:50,739
SAM:
That's you, Coach.

302
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,238
        Speaking.

303
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,638
        Boy, oh, boy...

304
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:58,038
      The damnedest thing.

305
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,537
I've been shivering all the way
        over here.

306
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:01,937
          Well, Coach,
you don't have a coat on.

307
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,737
        It's 30 degrees outside.

308
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:07,236
         Oh, thank God!
    I thought I had malaria.

309
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:08,936
             Whew!

310
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,735
Uh, Coach, I'm
having blackouts.

311
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:14,335
Kind of a nice break in the day,
        isn't it, Sammy?

312
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:15,435
Do you remember
Nick, Shelley?

313
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,734
            Dearly.

314
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:20,534
He was really Diane's only
      friend, real friend.

315
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:24,933
He would listen to Diane,
    and he would counsel her

316
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:28,133
    and-and offer her a kind
of support and friendship

317
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,432
    that didn't really
        come out clearly

318
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:33,532
 from many of the other members
          in the bar.

319
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:34,732
DIANE:
Coach?

320
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,331
         What do you do
    when you are so furious

321
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:38,631
 that you have to do something?

322
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,031
Well, I know you'll think
      it's kind of crazy,

323
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,230
    but, uh, I bang my head
          on the bar.

324
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,629
Doesn't sound crazy to me.

325
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:50,129
         It might do me
    a lot of good right now.

326
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,429
          Well, okay.

327
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,528
    No! No, oh, don't!

328
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,428
    But, uh, uh, you're so,
you're so beautiful, so...

329
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,127
    Beautiful?

330
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,527
Daddy, you have been saying
that I'm beautiful

331
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,727
ever since I was
a very little girl.

332
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,326
But look at me!

333
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,926
Not as my father,

334
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:10,126
  but like you're lookin' at me
      for the first time,

335
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:14,025
and please, try to see me
        as I really am.

336
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:21,524
                Oh, my God! I...

337
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:24,523
    I didn't realize how much
    you looked like your mother.

338
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,623
        I know.

339
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:28,523
I look exactly like her.

340
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:30,822
    And Mom was not...

341
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:38,921
    ...comfortable
    about her beauty.

342
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,821
            But that's what made
             her more beautiful.

343
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,620
                Your mother grew
                  more beautiful

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,020
          every day of her life.

345
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,518
She was really beautiful.

346
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,718
            Yes! And so are you.

347
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:01,018
    You're the most beautiful
         kid in the whole world.

348
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,717
Thanks, Daddy.

349
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,815
          LES CHARLES:
      <i>We wanted to create,</i>
       <i>uh... there are...</i>

350
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,615
      there are in America
    great neighborhood bars.

351
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:21,714
But not everybody has one,
 and so we thought we'd give--

352
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,614
uh, for all those poor, deprived
  people-- we'd give them one.

353
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,413
  And that included ourselves.
      We didn't have one.

354
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:29,713
      So we created one--
a place that we would like to go

355
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,612
    and spend time and, uh,
    where everybody could go

356
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:35,712
     one night a week and,
      and be with friends.

357
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:38,911
(shrieking)

358
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,011
                      (shouting)

359
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,011
        (all clamoring)

360
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,210
Come on! Carla!

361
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,410
Easy!
                Yeah, I got her!

362
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,109
          Let go! Oh!

363
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,409
         Let go of me!

364
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,909
You get your hand out!
Just stop it!

365
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,609
     You had the gall! Oh!
Just get...!

366
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:01,608
             Whoa!

367
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,507
              SAM:
        Stop that!
    Come on, you guys.

368
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,607
        (shouting)

369
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:07,507
         Whoa, whoa...
Oh, no! No!

370
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,506
CARLA:
Whoops!

371
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:13,706
          (screaming):
              No!

372
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,605
        (groaning)

373
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,705
            Oh, no!

374
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,405
    (Diane shrieking)

375
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:24,104
     Stop this immediately!

376
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,203
I have never been witness

377
00:17:31,203 --> 00:17:34,702
    to such a silly, soph...

378
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,701
         Sam Malone...

379
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,200
    kiss your butt good-bye!

380
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,600
         (all yelling)

381
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,299
(Diane screams)

382
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:02,298
          McLAUGHLIN:
       <i>When you conceived</i>
   <i>of the relationship between</i>

383
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:07,797
Diane Chambers and Sam Malone...
          what was it?

384
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,197
         I think that there
          was an intensity

385
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,596
      with the Sam and Diane,
     uh, affair that was, uh...

386
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:13,796
                     McLAUGHLIN:
                     Dominating?

387
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,196
          Yeah, very much so.

388
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:16,596
A really intelligent woman
        would see

389
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,795
  your line of BS a mile away.

390
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:20,395
              You think so? Huh?

391
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:21,995
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

392
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,194
                 Yeah, well, uh,
                    you know,

393
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:27,494
            I've never met an
            intelligent woman
          that I'd want to date.

394
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:31,593
  On behalf of the intelligent
    women around the world,

395
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,493
    may I just say... whew!

396
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,092
Well, I'll be darned.

397
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:42,091
                     What?

398
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:45,091
Nothing. I just, uh,
noticed something.

399
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,891
                     What?

400
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:51,090
  Well, I guess I've, uh, I've
  never looked into your eyes.

401
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,390
Something wrong with them?

402
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,889
 No, I, uh... just don't think

403
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,289
      I've ever seen eyes
    that color before.

404
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:01,288
As a matter of fact,
I don't think

405
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:03,988
I've ever seen
that <i>color</i> before.

406
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:06,887
          Yes, I have.
          Yes, I have.

407
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,587
                     Where?

408
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:16,786
I was, uh, I was on a ski
weekend up at Stowe. I...

409
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:21,385
 I was comin' in late one day,
 uh, last person off the slope.

410
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:24,485
The, the sun had just gone down.

411
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,984
    And the sky became
     this incredible color.

412
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,884
I, I usually don't, uh,
notice things like that,

413
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:34,383
and I found myself kind of
walking around in the cold,

414
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:37,383
hoping that it wouldn't change,

415
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:40,982
 wishing that I, I had somebody
there to share it with me.

416
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,182
    Then afterwards I tried
    to convince myself

417
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,881
 that I'd imagined that color,
            that...

418
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,881
 that I hadn't really seen it.

419
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:51,680
That nothing on this earth
could be that beautiful.

420
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,580
     Now I see I was wrong.

421
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,278
Wouldn't work, huh?

422
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:06,178
                     What?

423
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,977
      An intelligent woman
 would see right through that?

424
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,377
            Oh? Oh!

425
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,776
                In a minute.

426
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,176
    Damn.

427
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,075
              SAM
      <i>You are the nuttiest,</i>

428
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:29,674
  the stupidest, the phoniest
     fruitcake I ever met!

429
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:31,974
You, Sam Malone, are the most
arrogant, self-centered son...

430
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,073
                        Shut up!

431
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,773
      Shut your fat mouth!

432
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:36,473
        Make me.
                 Make you?

433
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:38,273
My God, I'm, I'm gonna...

434
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,772
    I'm gonna bounce you off
every wall in this office!

435
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,972
      Try it and you'll be
    walking funny tomorrow.

436
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:47,871
Or should I say funnier?

437
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,870
  You know... you know, I always
          wanted to pop you one.

438
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,070
                Maybe this is
              my lucky day, huh?

439
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,670
You disgust me!

440
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,970
    I hate you!

441
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,269
            Are you as turned on
                  as I am?

442
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,169
        More!
                    Bet me.

443
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,569
Wh-Whenever you think
too much about something,

444
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:04,768
it loses all its sense.

445
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,668
I mean, obviously the only
reason why I'm with you

446
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,168
is because I lo...

447
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:12,567
        What, Sam?

448
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:18,466
I said the reason why I'm
with you is 'cause I lo...

449
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:20,266
        You lo...?

450
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:23,365
        Well, you know,
     you know what I mean.

451
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:25,265
    Well, what's the matter?
    Can't you say it?

452
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,265
      Oh, of course I can.

453
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,065
I lo... I lo... I lo... I lo...

454
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,964
            DIANE:
 <i>Do you know what the difference</i>

455
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:33,264
         is between you
    and a fat, braying ass?

456
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:34,663
             Nope.

457
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:37,863
The fat braying ass would.

458
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,762
                Speaking of fat,
                  braying asses,

459
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:44,762
             you're about to get
                dumped on yours.

460
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:49,061
How dare you slap me!

461
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,460
Don't you ever hit me again!

462
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,760
                      Like hell.

463
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,359
            You always think you
      gotta get the last one in.

464
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,259
                    Oh, come on.
     All right, all right, fine!

465
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,658
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
             All right, come on.

466
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,258
              SAM:
   <i>All right, please, come on.</i>
             <i>Let go.</i>

467
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,757
       <i>Oh, what the hell?</i>

468
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:13,457
    Will you marry me?

469
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:19,356
              Will you marry me?

470
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,056
            No.

471
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:26,655
Oh, Diane, will you marry me?

472
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:30,354
                     (sobbing):
                      No, Sam.

473
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:33,554
Diane, will you marry me?

474
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:37,353
That didn't sound very sincere.

475
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,452
I'll be back here.

476
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:47,352
        I will.

477
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:50,051
I'll see you in six months.

478
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,751
    Okay?

479
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:53,251
                     Okay.

480
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,251
        Okay.

481
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:55,850
    That's better.

482
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,249
         (door closes)

483
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:12,548
    Have a good life.

484
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:16,547
(piano playing "What'll I Do?")

485
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,645
              ¶

486
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:48,042
              ¶

487
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:08,639
             JOHN:
         <i>Frasier Crane--</i>
  <i>what does he do for a living?</i>

488
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,838
      He's a psychiatrist.

489
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:14,938
    What is Frasier's
      philosophy of life?

490
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,637
      He hopes he can heal
      the human condition.

491
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,137
         Come on, man!

492
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:20,837
    Tell Diane you love her.

493
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,136
Let some fresh air and sunlight
        in there!

494
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:25,336
                Frasier?

495
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,436
    What, Sam?

496
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:28,935
            I don't like guys
            touching my head.

497
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:32,135
Well, there's our next session.

498
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,334
Is there, uh,
some of you in him?

499
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,934
                Sure.

500
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:42,033
            I would like to heal
              the world, yeah.

501
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,433
Have you notified
the world?

502
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,333
            Uh, in my small way,
                yeah.

503
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,332
(chuckles)

504
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:48,832
Is there some
of him in you?

505
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:55,131
        Uh, well, we do walk the
      same streets together now.

506
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:59,430
  I am running with scissors!

507
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:06,329
         You see, it's been
     psychologically documented

508
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:11,128
that all human animals have a
  neurotic hair-trigger response

509
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:14,228
         to, uh, at least one of
    the five sensory stimuli.

510
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,528
             Well, it could be
            anything, actually.

511
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:20,127
 Well, let's see, sound of the
surf pounding against the shore.

512
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,827
        The smell of honeysuckle
         on a warm summer night.

513
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:26,426
          The taste of a vintage
             Chateau Neu d'pais.

514
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:31,725
    Fire-red fingernails dancing
        through your chest hair.

515
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:37,024
        A black-lace teddy...

516
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:40,524
            straining against
            its fleshy cargo.

517
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,223
Frasier, man,
snap out of it.

518
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:45,723
            In a minute, Sam.

519
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:50,922
Did psychiatrist
Frasier Crane

520
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:55,221
provide services
for Diane Chambers?

521
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,221
                      No.
        No, that was,
          that was my job.

522
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,119
      When Diane left Sam,
 and he started drinking again,

523
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:09,819
    he was filling the void
        that Diane left.

524
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,518
 And Diane filled her emptiness
         by toying with

525
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:18,817
      and... destroying...
    a man who's her cultural

526
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:21,217
and intellectual superior
         in every way!

527
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:26,216
                REBECCA:
         Okay, kids, you say hi
            to Binky!

528
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:29,216
KIDS:
Hi, Binky!

529
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:35,015
      Binky, do your act.

530
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:38,914
      I don't have an act.
      I'm a psychiatrist.

531
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,114
             NORM:
      <i>Uh-oh, frost warning.</i>

532
00:26:45,513 --> 00:26:47,613
    Good afternoon,
    Dr. Crane.

533
00:26:50,812 --> 00:26:53,012
                Dr. Sternin.
              (clears throat)

534
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,612
         What a lovely surprise.

535
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,111
    I hope I can regard that
          as civility

536
00:26:57,111 --> 00:26:58,611
 in light of today's situation,

537
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,011
      rather than sarcasm
         at my expense.

538
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,310
    No, that was completely
        at your expense.

539
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,309
 What these two people, who are
such geniuses at romance,

540
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:13,709
  are trying to do is to get you
         to take your hair down,

541
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:15,308
                thinking that it
            will stimulate me

542
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:17,708
            like some sort of
                  Pavlovian dog.

543
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,507
                So why don't you
            just oblige them,

544
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,307
             get this silliness
                 over with

545
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:25,607
                so we can get on
                 with our lives?

546
00:27:25,707 --> 00:27:27,506
        (sighs)

547
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:33,105
You mean like this?

548
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:35,005
                    Precisely.

549
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,305
                  You know what?

550
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:39,704
            What?

551
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:41,504
          I'm going to kiss you.

552
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:43,604
         I'm gonna kiss you hard

553
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,403
                and I'm going
            to kiss you long.

554
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:49,203
             But make no mistake
                    about it,

555
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:50,503
         I am going to kiss you.

556
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,002
             In fact, I'm going
                to kiss you

557
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,702
            like you've never...

558
00:27:56,702 --> 00:28:01,001
            WOODY:
     <i>Oh, boy, my Aunt Edna's</i>
     <i>killer fudge brownies.</i>

559
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:02,701
    Oh, killers, huh?

560
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,300
     Yeah, they're called that
    because the first time

561
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
        my Uncle Ford ever
          smelled them baking,

562
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,000
  he came running in from the
field and got hit by a combine.

563
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:13,499
            He hung on
            for a few days.

564
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,798
            At the end,
    he was just praying to die.

565
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:18,698
      Well, eat up, everybody.

566
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:23,897
Hey, I don't know
about Indiana,

567
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:25,397
but around here,
when guys get together

568
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,097
to send another guy
off to his doom,

569
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:29,196
things can get
a little raunchy...

570
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:30,596
    (chuckles)

571
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:32,196
                 You fellas ever
        dress up farm animals

572
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,295
            in women's clothing?

573
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:39,295
            No.

574
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,094
                 Well, then
             I'm one up on you.

575
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:46,493
        Woody Harrelson,
tell us about Woody Boyd.

576
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:48,793
Uh, he likes other people,
        you know,

577
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,793
  and he, he likes connecting
          with people,

578
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:53,392
and he doesn't really, uh, care

579
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:56,092
      to, uh, own the bar
      or anything one day.

580
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,791
He just wants to be a bartender
and live in the big city.

581
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:02,491
Woods, she likes to do her
cushion pushing on four wheels.

582
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:05,390
                    Miss Howe...
                         really?

583
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,190
              You know, uh, back
              where I come from,

584
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,190
        we used to say something
          about girls like that.

585
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,890
             What?

586
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,789
                Let's date them.
(chuckles)

587
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,589
          Well, actually, Carla,

588
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,788
    as a student of the theater,
    I have to correct you.

589
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:19,788
     What you were doing there
    is not called acting.

590
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,088
        It's called improvising.

591
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:22,388
        Shut up, Woody.

592
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:25,087
Now, that would be directing.

593
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:32,586
I take it that there's a big
part of you in Woody Boyd.

594
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,786
    Yeah, I would say
the virtue in me is, uh...

595
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:36,985
        (laughing)

596
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,585
        (chuckles)

597
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,784
          No, I mean,
    we're both very honest.

598
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,284
        Miss Howe, I don't mean
             to insult you,

599
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,084
             but you're looking
            kind of puny.

600
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,284
        Have you lost weight?

601
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,383
Is this a setup?

602
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,683
Did Sam tell you to say that?

603
00:29:52,683 --> 00:29:54,882
        No, ma'am, I told myself
            to say it.

604
00:29:54,982 --> 00:29:57,282
    Thank you, Woody.

605
00:29:57,382 --> 00:30:00,182
    That's the nicest thing
  anyone said to me all week.

606
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:06,381
        Your hair's been looking
          kind of ratty, too.

607
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,480
  Some people say that they...

608
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
      they thought in your
    last couple of episodes,

609
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,979
that you've been a little bit
harsher than you normally are.

610
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,279
            Yeah, I agree,
                by the way.

611
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,378
            Shut up!

612
00:30:22,178 --> 00:30:22,978
        What's the use?

613
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:24,378
     I don't care anymore.

614
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:25,677
Don't be bitter.

615
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:27,677
      I'm not bitter, Sam.

616
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:30,077
    I'm just consumed
    by a gnawing hate

617
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,576
  that's eating away at my gut

618
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:33,876
until I can taste the bile
          in my mouth.

619
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,375
         Well, I guess
     I am a little bitter.

620
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,475
 Either that or I'm coming down
        with something.

621
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:44,274
  Does anybody have a Tic Tac?

622
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,374
             WOMAN:
        I was wondering
     if Woody could perhaps

623
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:52,173
            recite the lyrics
            to "The Kelly Song"?

624
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:54,073
  Let me get in the right key.

625
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:55,373
             Okay.

626
00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:57,972
      ¶ Kelly, my darling,
     you are my sunshine ¶

627
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,372
         (piano plays)

628
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:04,571
     ¶ When we're together,
         I feel fine ¶

629
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:07,471
              ¶

630

¶ Your smile is so lovely,
    your hair is so clean ¶

631
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:20,569
    ¶ You make me feel that
the whole world is mine ¶

632
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,768
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

633
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:24,268
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

634
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:25,968
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

635
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:28,767
         ¶ K-E-L-L-Y

636
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,367
             ¶ Why?
      Because you're... ¶

637
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:35,266
      ¶ Albania, Albania

638
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:41,165
 ¶ You border on the Adriatic

639
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:44,265
     ¶ Good night, ladies

640
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,664
     ¶ Good night, ladies

641
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:48,564
     ¶ Good night, ladies

642
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:51,464
¶ We're going to leave you now ¶

643
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:53,563
         ¶ Time to rap
     about a controversy ¶

644
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:56,263
     ¶ Gonna take a stand,
     won't show no mercy ¶

645
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:58,662
    ¶ Lotta folks say

00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:00,862
¶ Doin' the sports news on TV ¶

     ¶ I don't want to hear
    the latest score ¶

648
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:05,861
¶ From a punchy old broadcasting
         school board ¶

649
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:08,261
      ¶ So get your scores
      from a guy like me ¶

650
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,260
¶ Who knows what it's like
    to have a groin injury ¶

651
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,560
    ¶ G-g-groin, g-g-groin

652
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,359
      ¶ G-g-groin injury

653
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:27,358
             Boola!

654
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:31,657
The first night of the show,

655
00:32:31,757 --> 00:32:32,957
  I mean, I really realized--

656
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:35,056
        they introduced
    the cast members--

657
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:39,656
      and I felt the void
    from the audience.

658
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:43,155
      It was sort of like
a silent, horrible void...

659
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,355
         to me, I mean,

660
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:46,655
    maybe I was the only one
     seeing it, hearing it.

661
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,954
         But it was...
      it was for Shelley.

662
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,754
              So right when I...
            after I came out,

663
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:52,954
      and they, you know,
     they were nice to me,

664
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,353
     yeah, yeah, you know.

665
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:58,453
"Big deal, we're not gonna
like you no matter what you do."

666
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:00,152
        (laughing)

667
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:01,452
    I will prove it to you.

668
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:04,652
     I will dispel the myth
that you turn my stomach.

669
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:06,351
 I will give you a little kiss.

670
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:09,451
             Here.

671
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:10,751
             There.

672
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,548
Now, what category
am I in?

673
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:28,548
Yes? No?

674
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:34,047
Oh, jeez, boy, why do I
even bother with you?

675
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:36,546
             Whew!

676
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:38,446
        Definite maybe.

677
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:41,846
I heard that.

678
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,345
    You said "maybe."

679
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:44,645
We had an idea for a scene

680
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:46,545
where she's in the office
  and Sam comes in the office.

681
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,044
They've got a bet that if
he catches her with a cigarette,

682
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:50,144
  she will go to bed with him.

683
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:51,544
        A-ha!

684
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:56,743
        Oh, uh, hey, uh,
    where's the pool table?

685
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,143
        Oh, wrong room.

686
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:05,242
    She put a lit cigarette
         in her mouth,

687
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:08,141
  and all of a sudden we went,
"This woman has hidden talents!"

688
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,041
  Oh, Norm, I need your help.

689
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:12,541
     Oh, you just started.

690
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:13,640
     You're gonna do fine.

691
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,440
 Things are gonna turn around,
            I swear.

692
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,240
         No, you idiot,
  my hair's stuck to the wall!

693
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,939
It's a huge risk.

694
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:23,739
                  Take it.

695
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,239
                    Take it.

696
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,538
I'm moving to Tokyo.

697
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:27,938
I'm gonna take over
the Japanese division.

698
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:29,038
I leave tonight.

699
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:32,037
              Yes, darling, yes!

700
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,737
                 Oh...!

701
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:39,136
            Can I have my drink?

702
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,036
You know, you men
are all alike.

703
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,335
     Yeah, so where was I?

704
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:53,934
Uh, you were engaged to one of
the richest men in the world.

705
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:55,234
Could I just have my check?

706
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:57,033
                  Are you a man?

707
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:00,233
    Sure.

708
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,132
 I'm gonna have to break it off
          with Robin.

709
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,432
                  Well, it's the
              right thing to do.

710
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:10,831
  I'll just say to him, um...

711
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:13,031
    "That's it, sweet baby."

712
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,530
    I think the two of us are
      cut out of the same cloth.

713
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,729
                I think that we,
              perhaps, have a...

714
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,829
            a friendship in the,
                  in the making.

715
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,229
          We may not see it yet,

716
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,828
             but I think we have
        a deep, deep friendship.

717
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,128
                I think we're
                very similar.

718
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,628
Do you think you
share value systems?

719
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,927
                Well, I think
          we're equally shallow.

720
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:34,827
                    Mr. Colcord.

721
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:36,027
Rebecca, I'll be brief.

722
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:37,427
You were very
understanding about that

723
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:39,127
little incident
back in my limo,

724
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:40,126
and I think that kind

725
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:41,426
of understanding
should be rewarded.

726
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:43,826
 So, I'd like you to have this.

727
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:49,725
                  (scoffs)

728
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,624
          (whispers):
         It's gorgeous!

729
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:04,822
                No!

730
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:07,022
I should like to point out
     that if I had offered

731
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,522
         this bracelet
    to my chargé d'affaires,

732
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:10,422
  she would have snapped it up
        in a blur.

733
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:12,321
 Heh, I admire your standards.

734
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,721
     You know,

735
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:17,120
        this definitely
     puts you in the lead.

736
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,520
  Must go.

737
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,520
Would you care to join me?

738
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,619
    Did you hear that?

739
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,118
         I am winning!

740
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:31,818
          I'm winning!

741
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:33,518
                No! Hey, come...
                         listen!

742
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:34,918
                    Listen to me
              for a second here.

743
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,317
        Come on, you've given up

744
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:38,917
         something very valuable
             and very important.

745
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:41,017
        You're gonna regret this
          the rest of your life.

746
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,016
    Oh! You're right.

747
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:46,716
I will take that bracelet.

748
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:55,114
              SAM:
     <i>Oh, it's not just</i>
         <i>losing the job.</i>

749
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,914
It's that I was, you know,
taken advantage of.

750
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:01,513
              I know. I know.

751
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:03,713
You know,
that I was used.

752
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,013
That I was just...

753
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:07,512
you know, manipulated
by somebody who just

754
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:11,212
cynically wanted to get
something from me.

755
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:16,011
     Malone, what are you doing?

756
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,011
I'm feelin' bad.

757
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,510
             No, you are feeling
                    pretty good.

758
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,509
Okay, I admit it.

759
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,009
I'm not a sad guy.

760
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:29,009
I'm a happy, horny guy.

761
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,808
         What is Sam's
      philosophy of life?

762
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:36,008
     Service the queen bee,
        you know, to...

763
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:41,307
    Look at the two of you!

764
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:43,206
  No, look at the three of us!

765
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,306
     Let's look at the two
         of you again.

766
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:50,205
             Can we get a couple
      of piña coladas over here?

767
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:52,305
Sure thing. Let me just
finish makin' this margarita.

768
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,005
So, anyway, Margarita...

769
00:37:57,604 --> 00:38:00,404
All I can think about is getting
home and jumping into bed.

770
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:02,803
Need anybody to break your fall?

771
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:06,603
  Guess who.

772
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,602
            Uh-oh.
I'll give you a hint.

773
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,002
Vermont ski lodge,

774
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:12,702
a roaring fire and baby oil.

775
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:16,101
            Uh... could you, uh,
            be more specific?

776
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:19,101
                Great.

777
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,900
              What time will you
                 be getting off?

778
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,099
You've been with a lot of women.

779
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,199
No, I have not.

780
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,599
There have not
been that many women.

781
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:33,998
Uh, that gets exaggerated
here in the bar.

782
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:36,298
There haven't been
that many, really.

783
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,498
How many have there been?

784
00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:39,597
      Well, I don't know.

785
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,297
     Maybe, uh, four hun...

786
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:42,597
            (gasps):
             Oh...!

787
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,297
      Honeys, honeys.

788
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:45,596
     Four honeys.

789
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:47,196
         You know, Sam,

790
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,996
        the church does
    recommend chastity

791
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,395
      to unmarried people.

792
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,695
        (chuckles)

793
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:56,895
         Oh, I'm sorry.
     You're serious, uh...

794
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,094
For the sake of our friendship,

795
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,894
I am just gonna resist

796
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:03,993
my sexual urges
and that's all there

797
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:04,693
      is to it.

798
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:05,993
      Now, come here.

799
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,993
        There.

800
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:09,093
        All right.

801
00:39:09,193 --> 00:39:12,292
                You know that
              I loved Evan Drake

802
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,292
            since the first time
                      I met him.

803
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:15,592
I'm sorry. This is not working.

804
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,091
Hot fire below.

805
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:25,690
        I can't imagine
    not doing this... show.

806
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,189
             Um...

807
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,289
    I think the thing
     I notice is that, uh,

808
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:34,288
      when I walk around,
 the incredible, uh, the faces

809
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:38,288
  of the people that look back
  when they recognize <i>Cheers.</i>

810
00:39:38,388 --> 00:39:41,887
        That, that look
    and that face is, uh...

811
00:39:41,987 --> 00:39:44,287
      coming back at you.

812
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:46,886
Uh, it's such a privilege
         to walk around

813
00:39:46,986 --> 00:39:50,386
    in that atmosphere
    that it is, uh...

814
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:53,785
     it's... it's magical.
