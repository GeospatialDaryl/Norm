1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,596
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,788
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,997
- What can I do for you, Mr Peterson?
- Elope with my wife.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,195
What do you think, huh?

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,509
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, Cliffie.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,557
Pretend we're having
a normal conversation, huh?

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,278
With you?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,913
Party. My house. Saturday.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,832
Twelve noon sharp. You're invited.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,514
- A party at noon?
- Keep it under your hat, will you?

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,877
You're the only one in the bar I invited.
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,112
- Hurt mine.
- Norm, Norm, Norm.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,636
Look, we're gonna have plenty of beer,
cold cuts galore, a big bucket of slaw.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,597
Oh, you're gonna love it.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,990
And we're gonna maybe
do a little painting.

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,674
- Painting?
- Well, just the attic.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,718
That's not the point. I'm inviting a lot
of the guys from the post office.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,950
- lt'll be a great time.
- I don't think so, Clifford.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,680
- Hey, what's the problem here, Norm?
- You know I hate to paint.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,353
- You know that.
- Yeah, so who doesn't?

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,592
But, hey, with all these guys
around there, it'll take no time at all.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,275
Oh, all right.
But don't tell Vera, all right?

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,954
She'd get upset. I haven't finished
painting our house yet.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,633
Oh, how far have you gotten?

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,990
Oh, I bought the little hat.

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,237
I am so tired tonight. I can't wait
to get home and take a nice hot bath.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,479
What? Little Miss Popularity
has a free evening?

28
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,996
Don't tell me you've been through
all the men in Boston.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,752
Oh, really, Frasier.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,155
I heard you used to be
a psychiatrist, Dr Crane.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,716
Yes, I once belonged
to that ridiculous profession

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,758
where pompous intellectuals get
together and discuss the illusion

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,629
that there's something they can do
to alter the human situation

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,032
and deny that man is condemned
to a life of bitterness and despair.

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,995
Yeah, but you got your weekends off.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,713
I'm sorry, will you excuse me.

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,878
Poor Frasier. Lost his job,
and all he's got working for him

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,109
is a drinking problem.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,996
Well, you know, we ought to help
Dr Crane. I mean, we're his friends.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,157
Somebody ought to give him
a good talking to.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,436
Don't you think I've done that?

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,990
You can't imagine how long
and how hard I've talked.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,998
Oh, yes, we can.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,073
He's lost his self-esteem.

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,312
Without that, how can he hope
to practice his profession?

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,717
You know what Frasier needs?
He needs to come out of the bullpen

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,555
and get his first out. You know,
get his confidence back, his rhythm.

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,631
Sam, you're right.
If he could only cure someone.

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,394
Do we know someone with a problem?

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,749
Yeah, stumper.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,395
Come on, doesn't anyone
want to talk to Frasier?

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,869
- I mean, he's a trained psychiatrist.
- Hey, you're the one

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,591
who had her brain overhauled. Aren't
you still under warranty or something?

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,356
If I talk to him in any personal way,
he'll interpret it as a romantic overture.

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,950
Look, we don't even need someone
with a real problem.

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,475
One of you could go to him
with some symptoms,

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,154
Iet him advise you, wait a while,
then tell him you feel better.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,271
I don't know, Diane.

59
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,994
I think it's a good plan.

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,630
- Well, thank you, Woody.
- It's quick, it's simple,

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,713
and you don't have to send away
for one of those kits or anything.

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,393
What kits?

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,189
You know, like the coyote does
in the Road Runner cartoons.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,951
By the way, now, I always wondered,
if he can afford to buy those kits

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,795
to catch the Road Runner, why can't
he afford to buy something to eat?

66
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,710
Woody, I think you're missing
the point here.

67
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,714
It's not that Wile E. Coyote
wants to eat, necessarily,

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,916
or that he wants to eat a roadrunner.

69
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,278
What he wants is to eat
that particular roadrunner.

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,317
It's very existential.

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,871
We're trying to save
a man's life here.

72
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,716
Yeah, Cliff, really. Besides, I have
to disagree with you, you know.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,997
You never see the coyote
eat anything else.

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,589
Think about it. You never really
see him eat anything at all,

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,558
which could be why he's missing
the damn bird all the time, you know.

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,029
The brain needs sugar.
Think about it. You gotta clamp...

77
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,156
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But did you guys ever see the one

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,834
- where there were two roadrunners?
- Two roadrunners?

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,558
- Sam, Sam, Sam.
- What?

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
I think this plan will work,
and you're the one that has to do it.

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,512
Me? Oh, come on. You can't expect
me to pull something over on Frasier.

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,193
I don't know anything
about psychology.

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,272
But you have no idea how simple this
will be. I'm talking about something

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,510
as easy as, say, depression.

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,995
- Depression?
- Yes.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,593
The symptoms are loss of appetite,
inability to sleep, loss of sex drive.

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,593
Loss of sex drive,
like in not wanting to have any sex?

88
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,479
Forget it. No, no, no. I don't like
to lie about things like that.

89
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,518
Oh, Sam, why not?

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,389
Well, when I was a kid, I used to make
goofy faces. My mom used to say,

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,234
"Don't do that. It may stay that way."

92
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,358
I'm not doing anything goofy with
my sex life. No, I'm sorry. Come on.

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,712
Sam, Sam, Sam. Do this for me,
and I'll owe you a big, big favour

94
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,919
that doesn't involve sex, sex or sex.

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,036
- How about sex?
- Or sex.

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,838
Hey, Woody, pour me a beer, will you?
Thanks.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,794
Sam, do it for Frasier, your friend.

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,632
Now, there's a head I can shrink.

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,709
- Say, Frasier.
- Yeah, Sam?

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,476
Can I talk to you for a minute in my
office, please? This won't take long.

101
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,555
Look, Sam, I know my bar bill's
way up there,

102
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,877
but I'm gonna be selling off part of my
library, possibly some office furniture.

103
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,759
No, no, no, forget it.
I mean, I want you to pay your bar bill,

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,309
but that's not what I want
to talk about.

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,119
Frasier, I got a problem.
I'm depressed.

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,396
Oh, hey, who isn't?

107
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,759
Oh, well, no, no, no.
This is serious.

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,195
I think I need some professional help
on this one.

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,480
I can't eat, can't sleep
and I can't have sex.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,037
- Those are the classic symptoms.
- Well, the sex part's not that bad.

111
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,430
I don't even know
why I brought it up.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,911
Well, what do you think
has caused this problem?

113
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,839
The completely nonsexual one?

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,310
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
What do you think it is?

115
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,990
You know, you're the only person
I trust to listen to on this one.

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,993
Well, okay, Sam,
I think I have some advice for you.

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,069
- Oh, good. What?
- Well, get yourself a qualified therapist

118
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,832
to help you get over your depression.

119
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,350
And when you do, give me his name.

120
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,799
No way can a coyote survive
a gunpowder sandwich.

121
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,398
Well, I suppose that proves that
the coyote's the Antichrist. Come on.

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,557
Well, I can tell by the look on your face
and Frasier's that it didn't go well.

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,752
Not only did it not work,
but I had to tell another man

124
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,070
that my equipment was on the fritz.

125
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,276
It was humiliating.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,437
Well, I really appreciate
that you gave it a try, Sam.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,999
Thank you.

128
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,594
Oh, wait a minute. You still owe me
a favour here, don't you?

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,070
Oh, I suppose I do.
Do you have something in mind?

130
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,635
Yeah, let's go to bed.

131
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,950
Sam, have you forgotten my caveats?

132
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,197
Almost. I was hoping
to refresh my memory.

133
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,633
Good morning, one and all.
I feel delicious.

134
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,957
- Well, good morning, Frasier.
- Good morning.

135
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,310
- Coffee. May l, Sam?
- Sure.

136
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,436
- Certainly.
- Listen, Diane, if you wouldn't mind,

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,160
I'd like to have a word in private
with Sam.

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,675
- Of course. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,111
Sam, I had the most
incredible evening.

140
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,840
Last night I dreamed
about something not Diane.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,390
Well, she was in the background
chattering on about something. Naked.

142
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,836
But the important thing is
I was a therapist again.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,958
And you were my patient,
and we were discussing that problem.

144
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,395
- Problem? What problem?
- You know, the one about your--

145
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,711
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,269
Why don't we just go into my office
and talk about it there.

147
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,953
- I'm sorry it's so messy.
- All right.

148
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,913
I got home last night, and I couldn't
get your problem out of my mind.

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,435
- I think I've got a handle on it.
- Well, great.

150
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,996
Your whole problem stems from the
fact that you're still in love with Diane.

151
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,796
You've been suppressing
that emotion, denying it.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,514
Well, what's your opinion about that?

153
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,035
Let me go find out.
I mean, let me think it out.

154
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,317
I think better out here, more light.

155
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,233
- I hope you're happy.
- Why? What happened?

156
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,834
Frasier thinks I'm depressed
because I'm in love with you.

157
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,508
Oh, dear. I didn't see that coming.

158
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,069
Yeah. I'm gonna go back in there
and tell him the truth

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,470
- before this gets even more ridiculous.
- Oh, Sam.

160
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,632
Didn't you see the bounce in that
man's step? The twinkle in his eye?

161
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,950
Let him think he made
a good diagnosis.

162
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,357
What harm could it possibly do?

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,318
Oh, I don't know. As long as
you don't think I'm in love with you.

164
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,795
- Well, I don't.
- All right.

165
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,837
Not entirely.

166
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,798
At all.

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,791
Much.

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,475
Not a bit.

169
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,070
Mostly.

170
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,874
- Okay, you got it.
- Got what?

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,594
Oh, come on. We don't have
to rehash this over and over again.

172
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,072
- You said it, and I agree with it.
- But trust me. Sam, say it.

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,550
Take a step toward feeling stronger
and better.

174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,793
Free yourself. Sam, say it now.

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,033
Okay. Okay.

176
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,438
- I love Diane.
- Oh, God, it's true.

177
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,792
Thank you, Sam.

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,997
You're welcome. Are you all right?

179
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,311
I'm better than all right. I'm reborn.

180
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,233
That revelation was just
the catharsis I needed.

181
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,676
I've looked at the truth in its pure,
undiluted form.

182
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,638
Now I can get on with my life.

183
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,118
Oh, well, great. Hey, I feel better.
You feel better. What could be better?

184
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,317
No, just a second, Sam.
You've only just begun.

185
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,789
- What do you mean?
- You've admitted that you love Diane.

186
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,349
To get rid of your depression,
you'll have to admit it to her.

187
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,317
Sam, you must tell her
that you love her.

188
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,270
Come on, man, don't make me
say that. Don't-- Come on.

189
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,954
- Well, why not?
- Because I don't--

190
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,157
- Because I don't want to.
- Come on, man.

191
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,598
Tell Diane you love her. Let some
fresh air and sunlight in there.

192
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,798
- Frasier?
- What, Sam?

193
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,110
I don't like guys touching my head.

194
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,393
Well, there's our next session.

195
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,951
I'm gonna run over to Louis
and take a look at the new spring line.

196
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,156
See what I can do for
the outer man, eh, Sam?

197
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,312
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.
So this thing with Diane doesn't have

198
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,835
- to take place right away?
- Oh, yes, it does.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,468
Sam, it's very important.
You must tell her immediately.

200
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,831
I'll be back tomorrow, and you can fill
me in on everything that transpires.

201
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,474
Every thought, every nuance,
every detail.

202
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,035
- Every thought?
- Absolutely. Oh, and, Sam,

203
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,795
- this one's on the house.
- Oh, great.

204
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,069
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

205
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,558
- What can I get you, Mr Peterson?
- Clifford Clavin's head.

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,553
Well, what are you upset
with Mr Clavin about?

207
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,672
I spent the whole day yesterday
at Cliff's house at a painting party,

208
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,308
and I was the only one
who showed up.

209
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,509
I painted all day while Cliff
and his mother

210
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,956
argued over who forgot to pick up
the food and beer.

211
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,431
Did they at least thank you
for your hard work?

212
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,312
Well, Woody, that depends
if you consider

213
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,597
"your friend sweats like a mule"
a thank you.

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,999
No, that's really more
like polite conversation.

215
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,790
Hey, what a party. What a night.

216
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,390
Hey, Norm. Tell me, did I make
an ass out of myself, huh?

217
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,314
I'd bet on it.

218
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,277
Sam, calm down.
There's nothing to be excited about.

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,193
Tell Frasier you told me
you loved me.

220
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,713
- Simple as that, huh?
- Certainly.

221
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,199
Well, for your information, he wants
details. Every thought, every moment.

222
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,592
Oh, dear, you're right.

223
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,876
Knowing Frasier,
he'll want a complete account.

224
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,117
- Yeah, right.
- Well, it's still quite simple.

225
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,392
Tell him you said, "Diane, I love you."

226
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,790
I said, "How very sad for you."

227
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,951
- Then you said--
- No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.

228
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,751
This was your stupid plan.
Now, if I have to be in love with you,

229
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,036
then you have to be in love with me.

230
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,158
- Oh, all right, if it'll help Frasier.
- All right.

231
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,875
So I love you,
and you're gaga over me.

232
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,997
"Gaga" makes it sound like I'm more
in love with you than you are with me.

233
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,037
If we're going to do this,

234
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,478
I want to be only as much in love
with you as you are with me.

235
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,676
Okay, I love you, you love me.

236
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,279
Now...

237
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,591
...the story.

238
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,473
Okay, we went out for Chinese,

239
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,676
told each other you know what,

240
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,912
and then we went back
to my place and tore one off.

241
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,958
- Good lord.
- What?

242
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,435
Well, Frasier knows
I would never be seduced

243
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,113
by such a pedestrian approach.

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,392
Hey, who said anything about walking?

245
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,509
Fine. Fine. Let me hear your
suggestion. This ought to be good.

246
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,717
Oh, how about this?

247
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,314
Do you remember that romantic
hideaway in Marblehead?

248
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,193
- The one with the fabulous seafood?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,552
Tell him we arrived at sunset.

250
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,994
The maitre d'...

251
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,993
- You better write this down.
- Oh, I like this.

252
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,790
All right.

253
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,153
Sunset.

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,199
- We asked for our table.
- Yeah, right by the big fireplace.

255
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,716
- With the ocean view.
- Okay.

256
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,394
Now, what did we eat?

257
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,956
He's not going to ask you what we ate.

258
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,828
We were too hungry to eat.
Oh, that's good. That's good.

259
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,833
No, it's not good.

260
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,831
No, no, no. You see,
hungry usually means food.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,436
- Now, what I'm doing here--
- No, I get it.

262
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,596
It's just not good. Erase that.

263
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,196
All right. All right.

264
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,150
Tell him you were
so filled with passion

265
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,595
that you pushed the plates aside
and grabbed my hand.

266
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,315
"Filled with passion."

267
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,876
Then you say what you brought me
up there to tell me.

268
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,191
Oh, yeah, yeah. "l love you."

269
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,396
Well, Sam,
I think you can enhance it a bit.

270
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,399
Like,

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,514
"l love you, Diane.

272
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,071
I've always loved you,
and I always will, till the day I die.

273
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,075
No, not even the grave
will diminish my love.

274
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,798
Only...

275
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,952
Only make its flame burn brighter."

276
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,350
Whatever.

277
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,759
- Then, of course, it's my turn.
- Yeah, right. What do you say to me?

278
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,234
I look you in the eyes and I say,
"You're not so bad yourself."

279
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,918
No, no, no. Come on.
After what I just said to you?

280
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,470
No, no, no. It's gotta be more.
Something like,

281
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,313
"l love you so much, I can't stand it.

282
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,953
As far as I'm concerned,

283
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,237
you're the only person
in the world that matters to me,

284
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,791
and I'd jump at the chance
to be your love slave."

285
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,196
Whatever.

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,718
All right, all right, all right.

287
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,599
Okay, so then we go upstairs.

288
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,876
If you insist.

289
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,713
We can leave the rest
to Frasier's imagination.

290
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,713
We're already up there, I mean...

291
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,714
I mean, the room is paid for.

292
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,798
All right, all right.
I'll just build a fire.

293
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,515
- If you like.
- Yeah.

294
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,070
Then go over to the bed,

295
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,553
and I'll start nibbling on your ear.
Yeah. You always used to love that.

296
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,438
Oh, yeah.

297
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,870
- What do you mean, "Oh, yeah"?
- Oh, nothing.

298
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,758
No, no, no.
Come on, what do you mean?

299
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,076
Well, I don't suppose it would
do any harm to tell you.

300
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,028
As long as we're on the subject,
I never particularly cared for that.

301
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,550
The ear nibbles?

302
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,399
Well, you sure seemed to.

303
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,309
I didn't want to upset you,
male pride and all that.

304
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,790
What else did you seem to enjoy?

305
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,993
Everything else was fine.

306
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,709
Just the ear nibbles were annoying.

307
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,353
I'm only bringing this up because
there's no longer anything between us,

308
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,229
- and we've grown so.
- Yeah, yeah. Grown.

309
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,994
You know,
while we're on the subject here,

310
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,232
you remember that little
yellow nightie you used to wear?

311
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,079
As I recall, I never wore it very long.

312
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,949
- You loved that nightie.
- No, no, you just thought I loved it.

313
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,997
- You didn't love it?
- It made you look like a big banana.

314
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,792
It's good that we can laugh
like this, right?

315
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,072
I can't believe I paraded around
in that damn nightgown

316
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,995
thinking I was arousing you,
and instead, I was amusing you.

317
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,759
It wasn't amusing that long.
I mean, after a while, it got kind of sad.

318
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,595
Why didn't you tell me?

319
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,309
Well, because I knew
we'd get in a fight,

320
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,118
and you'd end up saying
that you hate me.

321
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,756
- Well, I do hate you, Sam.
- Well, I hate you, Diane.

322
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,395
You're incapable of any originality.

323
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,632
Now, you just said you hate me
because I said I hate you.

324
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,469
All right, fine. I'll change mine.
Yours was "l hate you."

325
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,995
Mine will be "l hate you!"

326
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,276
Oh, great.

327
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,392
And I just bought three ltalian suits.

328
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,313
- Oh, shut up, Frasier!
- Sam, what happened here?

329
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,715
Well, the same thing that
always happens. She's a nut.

330
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,438
She's certifiably insane.

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,830
Look, Sam, is that any way to talk
to the woman you love?

332
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,595
Oh, come on, Frasier!
Let me fill you in here, pal.

333
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,990
I don't love Diane.
That was just part of her plan

334
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,994
to make you feel better by making
you think that you'd cured me.

335
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,877
- I see.
- I'm sorry.

336
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,033
Frasier, you were once
a brilliant psychiatrist.

337
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,439
We couldn't bear standing by,
seeing you throw it all away.

338
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,398
So this is what it's come to.

339
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,269
You were practicing deceit
to get my confidence back.

340
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,034
You took pity on me.

341
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,519
You, of all people.

342
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,990
Two of the most pitiful people I know.

343
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,794
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's a lot more pitiful than I am.

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,834
- Sam.
- You're both pitiful. I'm pitiful.

345
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,312
We're, all three,
a pitiful ménage à boobs.

346
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,708
Well, this boob is moving on.

347
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,314
You two may not have the courage
to face it, but I finally do.

348
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,035
Sam and Diane, you are now
and have always been, hopelessly in,

349
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,555
I guess the word for it is "love."

350
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,474
And unfortunately for you,
like it or not, you always will be.

351
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,468
I know! I know!
Now you're gonna deny it.

352
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,949
Even though it's ludicrously obvious
to everyone around you,

353
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,511
you two will go on pretending it's not
true because you're emotional infants!

354
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,159
You're in a living hell.

355
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,151
You love each other
and you hate each other.

356
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,072
And you hate yourselves
for loving each other.

357
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,357
Well, my dear friends,
I want no part of it.

358
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,557
It's time I just picked up my life
where I left off.

359
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,792
It's time to put Humpty-Dumpty
back together again.

360
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,912
So I'll get out of here now so you can
just get on with your denial fest.

361
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,596
Well?

362
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,153
Well, what?

363
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,353
What do you think about...

364
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,397
...what Frasier said?

365
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,994
Frasier's a pretty sharp guy.

366
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,799
Well, we agree on something.

367
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,756
What's next?

368
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,235
Well, if this is hell, I'm...

369
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,195
I'm not that unhappy.

370
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,193
Then we agree on something else.

371
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,359
Yeah.

372
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,357
Hey, I only said that...

373
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,990
That I didn't like your nightgown
because you said...

374
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,469
...that you didn't like my ear nibbles.

375
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,313
Well, I would've liked your ear nibbles
if you hadn't sounded

376
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,675
so much like a chipmunk.

377
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,993
Well, I'd rather sound like a chipmunk
than look like a banana.
