00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,691
Hey, woody.                    
 I'll have a nice,              
 tall iced tea.

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,159
Yeah, in just a second, 
        dr. Crane.

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:12,727
I gotta take           
         a couple of aspirin.

5
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,579
I got a splitting  
             headache.

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,297
You know,                      
 there's a school of thought    
 that suggests

7
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:20,035
that all physical pain,        
 headache, earache,             
 stomachache, what have you...

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,502
a headache.     
                Pay attention.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,673
Thank you.

10
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:27,776
Anyway, these people say       
 that those pains are

11
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:30,511
merely physical manifestations 
 of some deeper trauma,

12
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,314
either psychological,          
 emotional, or spiritual.

13
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:35,416
See, suppose you just relax    
 and try to remember

14
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:36,952
the very thing                 
 you were thinking

15
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:38,720
when the headache              
 first started.

16
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,723
Then we may be able            
 to get to the root             
 of the problem.

17
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,291
All right. Well,

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,493
i was, uh,

19
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,429
i was standing here,           
 and i was thinking about       
 how when i was a little kid,

20
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:51,566
i was the only kid         
     in my town who             
     didn't have a bicycle.

21
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,801
Ok, go with that.

22
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,970
I mean, all the other kids 
     had one. Why not me?

23
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:56,871
Excellent. Continue.

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,057
And then i bent down   
         real fast to pick up   
         a napkin and--

25
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,125

26
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,344
[sighing]

27
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:05,012
i hit my head again!

28
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,540
So what do you think       
     it is, dr. Crane?

45
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,483
now all we             
         really know is that

46
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,154
robin is using             
     my--my secret password

47
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:39,157
to break into my corporation's 
 confidential files.

48
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:43,328
And from the date on these,    
 well, it looks like he's been  
 doing it since...

49
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:46,697
well, since the day after  
     we first slept together.

50
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,900
So all i think we can really   
 conclude from this is that

51
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,536
i am too stupid to live!

52
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:56,257
Rebecca. My darling.

53
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,558
What are you doing?

54
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,493
I'm turning you in.

55
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:03,281
You used me.                
    And don't try to deny it    
    because i've got proof.

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,185
Robin, i'm a human being       
 and i deserve to be treated    
 like one.

57
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,455
Well, it's about time       
    i stood up                  
    and did what was right.

58
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,190
Goodbye, robin.

59
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,474
Rebecca.

60
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:15,960
Will you marry me?

61
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,712
Ok.

62
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,950
No, whoa, whoa, wait.  
         Excuse me, excuse me.

63
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,252
But, it's-- it's not   
         rebecca's fault.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,639
It's not her.          
         It--it's robin colcord

65
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,907
who planned this whole  
        hostile takeover thing.

66
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,776
I mean, she called this 
        meeting to warn you.

67
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,261
It's not her fault.

68
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,413
Do you have any evidence       
 to back it up?

69
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,198
Yeah, you bet i do.

70
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,766
You want evidence?

71
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,201
Look at this.          
         If this doesn't clear  
         rebecca's good name,

72
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,603
i don't know       
             what will, huh?

73
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,703
I mean, look at it.

00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,082
[People chattering]

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,318
hey, wood,         
             you see the paper?

76
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,755
No. I don't read               
 the paper anymore.             
 It's too depressing.

77
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,041
Many people feel        
        that way, woody.

78
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,510
Yeah, i mean, uh, lucy's       
 always pulling the football    
 away from charlie brown.

79
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,014
The lockhorns              
     are always fighting.

80
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,582
Henry still doesn't        
     have a mouth.

81
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,369
Woody, woody.

82
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:17,421
Front page.             
        Look who got indicted   
        for insider trading.

83
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,789
Wow.

84
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,193
That guy looks exactly     
     like robin colcord.

85
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,530
Whoa! He even has          
     the same name.

86
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,798
Hey, let's kid him about it    
 when he comes in, huh?

87
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:33,454
Woody, this is obviously       
 the same robin colcord         
 that we all know.

88
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,623
Well, then it'll be            
 even funnier.

89
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:39,127
Well, it's always good         
 to see justice done.

90
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,630
But i--i have to tell you,     
 i hate to think                
 of the poor man in prison.

91
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,533
Those wretched places          
 are filled with                
 the worst degenerates

92
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,470
and most worthless dirty scum  
 ever on this planet.

93
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:49,904
Frasier,                
        why would you say that?

94
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,606
Well, i was                    
 a prison counselor.

95
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,826
You know, very often,      
     i was their only friend.

96
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:59,413
So what do you suppose         
 will happen to mr. Colcord?

97
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,582
Well, i suppose he'll get      
 the full measure of the law.

98
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,285
You see,                       
 this country is sick and tired 
 of these corporate raiders

99
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:05,853
that have plundered         
    our economy.

100
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,090
The days of junk bonds 
         and wall street deals  
         are behind us.

101
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:12,077
Although i--i do hear   
        there's some good       
        penny stocks out there.

102
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,261
Say, you know,                 
 i think i'll give              
 my broker a call.

103
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:17,431
Good morning, everyone.

104
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,383
Well, mr. Colcord,

105
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,785
what a surprise.

106
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,587
I hate to bring up         
     a sensitive subject,

107
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,589
but shouldn't you be       
     receiving love letters

108
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,659
from a certain          
        one-eared gentleman     
        named turk about now?

109
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,682
Excuse me?             
         Oh, you're referring   
         to my arrest, uh...

110
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,184
robin is out on bail,

111
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,135
and it looks like              
 he'll probably get off.

112
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,305
He has a clean record,         
 and this is his first offense,

113
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,840
and i think the judge          
 will be very lenient with him.

114
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,225
Oh, i must run.

115
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,861
I've got a meeting      
        with counsel to discuss 
        my defense strategy.

116
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:49,680
Can't let you be               
 the bride of a convict, hmm?

117
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,683
If he goes to jail,

118
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,685
he'll be the bride         
     of a convict.

119
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,558
The social life                
 of those people is shocking.

120
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,395
Bye-bye, sweetie.   
            Everything is gonna 
            turn out fine.

121
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,683
That's the way     
             we'll be kissing   
             on visiting day

122
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,852
for the next 20 years.

123
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,703
I thought you were so sure     
 he was gettin' off.

124
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,639
Are you kidding?        
        He'll fry.

125
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,575
Street lamps will dim.

126
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:24,382
Rebecca,                       
 they do not fry people         
 for insider trading.

127
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,851
But what if they do, norm? 
     What if they do?

128
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,387
I mean, i love that man,   
     and i'm just about ready   
     to lose him.

129
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,690
Have you ever thought       
    what it would be like to be 
    without vera for 20 years?

130
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,824
Oh, my god.

131
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,826
You see?           
             You'd miss vera.

132
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,295
Oh, i thought you said beer.

133
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,271
Oh, hey, rebecca.

134
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,923
There you are.

135
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,508
You heard      
                 they got him,  
                 huh, sam?

136
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,559
Yeah.

137
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,244
Yeah, i really feel            
 terrible about that.

138
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:56,280
I--i want you to understand--  
                 i don't know   
                 what happened.

139
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,183
I thought that,        
         and i really feel      
         ashamed to say this,

140
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,952
but i thought              
     that you ratted on robin.

141
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,855
But then i realized         
    you would never do anything 
    that indecent,

142
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,057
and i know that no matter  
     how much you hate robin,

143
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,160
you would never jeopardize 
     my happiness like that.

144
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,997
Oh, boy, uh, you really        
 know me better                 
 than i know myself.

145
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,316
Well, i'm gonna go 
             freshen up.

146
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:17,968
Every time i cry like this 
     i get all red and swollen

147
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,870
and puffy and raw.

148
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,539
And that's just your ankles.

149
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:23,891
Goodbye.

150
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,011
Poor kid.

151
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,280
Just when it looks like        
 things are gonna               
 work out for her,

152
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,215
like she's gonna finally       
 achieve her life's dream,

153
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:35,553
her--her heart gets broken,    
 and her whole life             
 is shattered yet again.

154
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,356
Yup. You can just about 
        set your watch by it.

155
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,795
Mr. Malone, i'm glad       
     i caught up with you.

156
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:49,100
The board of directors         
 is anxious to reward you       
 for saving our corporation.

157
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,436
(Cliff)                 
        savin' the corporation?

158
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,605
Uh, yeah, uh...

159
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,473
well, thanks.                  
 Why don't you just, uh, send   
 me a calendar or something?

160
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,276
Oh, no, no, no.                
 Sam, you're being              
 much too modest.

161
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,979
We know you've been            
 trying to buy back this bar    
 for some time now,

162
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,249
and we've decided           
    that, as a token            
    of our gratitude,

163
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:08,052
the least we can do            
 is sell it to you              
 at a reduced price.

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,454
You're kidding.    
             How much?

165
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,938
$1.

166
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,723
Take it                    
     or leave it.

167
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,241
This bar?

168
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,911
I--i give you $1,           
    and--and this bar is mine?

169
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,363
That's right, mr. Malone.      
 No catch.

170
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,533
I can't believe this.      
     This bar is mine, and all  
     i have to do is give you--

171
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,102
oh, shoot, shoot, shoot!

172
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,521
Hey, give me $1, huh?          
                I'm tapped out.

173
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,873
Anybody.                       
 W-woody, give me $1, man.

174
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,808
Now, you already   
             owe me $1, sam.

175
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,710
Come on.

176
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,978
Sam, i got a quarter.

177
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,013
Oh, hey, hey, sammy,           
 here--here's a dime.

178
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,548
Here, here,     
                here's 4 bits.

179
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,316
Great.

180
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,786
I, uh, ok, i--i got,   
         uh, 85 cents here.

181
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:45,189
Hmm, i'll take it.

182
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,693
All right!         
             Hey, guys,         
             i low-balled him.

183
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,713
There's the title deed,        
 mr. Malone.

184
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:53,814
[Exclaiming]

185
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:55,600
sammy, what's going on?

186
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,369
I just bought the bar back.    
 Sammy's got the bar back!      
 What?

187
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,120

Sammy's got the bar back!

00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,832
Sammy's got the bar back!

Sammy's got the bar back!

00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,318
Sammy's got the bar back!

196
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,120
Sammy's got the bar back!

197
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,888
Shut up!

198
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,043
Some of us might be depressed.

199
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,661
Hey, sam got                   
 the bar back, miss howe

200
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,762

201
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:26,364
Goodbye, mr. Malone.

202
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,048
Yeah, thanks very much.

203
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:31,302
Well, it's the least       
     we can do for the man      
     who gave us colcord.

204
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:41,262
You turned robin in!

205
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,632
You are a dead man, buddy!     
 You are a dead man!

206

Sammy is a dead man!

209

Sammy is a dead man!

210
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:01,449
My bar.

211
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,419
It's my bar.

212
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:07,955
My bar.

213
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,124
My glasses, my tables.

[Gasping]              
         my, my.

00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:18,099
Sammy,                 
         i am so proud of you.  
    Yeah!

216
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,867
[Laughing]

217
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,802
hey, hey. I know           
     how we should celebrate.   
     Yeah?

218
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,571
Why don't you just take me 
     right on top of the bar

219
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,573
like you did       
             in the old days.

220
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:28,709
I never did that.

221
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,628
Then who was that guy?

222
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,733
Oh, that was                
    the manager of the bar      
    where i worked before this.

223
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,252
Hey, can anybody give me    
    a ride to the broken spoke?

224
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,840
Hey, guys, guys, huh?

225
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,241
Remember this, huh?    
     All right.

226
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,776
(All)              
             hey.

227
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,928
Yeah, you've been gone     
     too long, big guy.

228
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,597
[Exclaiming]

229
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,717
well, somehow,                 
 everything feels all right     
 with this world tonight.

230
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,402
Yup, it's only been    
         a few hours, cliffie,

231
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:55,903
but the air smells fresher,

232
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:57,371
stool's a little   
             more comfortable,

233
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,340
and the beer tastes better.

234
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,825
Ok, guys.              
         Closing time. Beat it.

235
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,911
I don't know if i like     
     the new owner, though.

236
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,130
Come on, norm,         
         i'll give you a ride.

237
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,366
(Frasier)              
         well,

238
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,033
warmest congratulations, sam.

239
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,936
You know, it's always      
     heartening to see a man    
     realize his dream.

240
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:16,507
Especially poignant        
     when he realizes           
     such a pathetic dream.

241
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,293
Thanks, man.

242
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,895
Oh, i only joke with you,      
 sam, because i love you.

243
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:23,464
Well, i didn't know 
            you were joking.

244
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:25,466
[Sobbing]                  
     oh, i didn't know          
     i loved you.

245
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,954
Uh, fellas, fellas,

246
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,423
you want-- you want    
         to give frasier        
         a ride home here?

247
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,258
[Sobbing]                      
 i love you all, i...

248
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,695
well, it's all right           
 for a man to cry, you know.

249
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:38,829
(Norm)                     
     you're sitting in the back

250
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,164
with the windows open, 
         frasier.

251

                        sammy?  
     Yeah?

252
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:49,539
Woody and i are so happy       
 to be working for you again.

253
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,841
And we're not      
             the only ones.

254
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,477
[Cackling]         
        yeah?

255
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,212
Hey-hey, dave!

256
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:57,047
I missed you, sammy.

257
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,170

[Laughing]                     
 actually, that was me, sam.

259
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,109
Yeah, i know, woody,    
        i know.

260
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,330
Sam, uh...

261
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:15,165
i'd like to, uh, apologize     
 for my earlier outburst there.

262
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,418
I guess i just got         
     a little over-emotional.

263
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:19,854
Dave!

264
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:22,806
[Sobbing]              
         is that dave?

265
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:28,012
Dave is back.              
     I love you, dave.

266
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,580
Come on.                       
 You're riding on the hood.

267
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,648
Come on.

268
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,989
Hey, sam,                      
 is it really all right         
 for a man to cry?

269
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:39,356
Absolutely not, man.

270
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,725
I didn't think so.             
                         No.

271
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,631
I'm leaving now.           
     Don't anybody look at me   
     or talk to me.

272
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey, well, no, i can't let you 
 walk out like this--

273
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,003
hey, wait, listen to me.       
 I only turned him in

274
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,155
because i thought that         
 they were gonna go after you.

275
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,490
You're right.

276
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,225
I should listen            
     to your side of the story.

277
00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,727
Yeah, all right, all right.    
 It's about time.

278
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,629
Would you stop it? 
             Hey, hey, hey.

279
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,196
Let go of me!                  
 I wanna get out of here!

280
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,599
I just took my stuff           
 from your office,              
 and now i'm leaving.

281
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,268
Miss howe,                     
 you're leaving for good?

282
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,504
I mean, i guess i should have  
 realized that you would,

283
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,907
but now that                   
 you actually are...

284
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:14,508
[sobbing]                      
 i'm gonna miss you.

285
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:18,379
Don't those push pins          
 belong to the bar?

286
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,518
Woody, woody, woody,           
 it's all right, man. Don't--

287
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:28,372
yeah, whoa. Now what?          
 These index cards?             
 And these staples?

288
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,790
Woody, she's upset.

289
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:32,243
Well, she's taking             
 all our stuff, sam.            
 This is even our box.

290
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,860
Woody,             
             shut up, will ya?

291
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:36,297
Oh, this my sweater!           
     Woody, shut up! Come on!

292
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,983
You just take              
     your own damn stuff.

293
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,202
I don't wanna be reminded      
 of this stupid place anyway.

294
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,621
Oh, wait, miss howe,   
         this isn't my sweater.

295
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,090
But if you don't want it...

296
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,376
come here.

297
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,345
Listen, i can't let you 
        walk out like this.

298
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,713
Y-you got to    
                forgive me.     
                Please.

299
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:55,816
All right, i forgive you.      
 I wish you well.

300
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,017
Goodbye.

301
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,752
And i hope you're happy        
 with your crummy bar

302
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,155
and your stupid friends,       
 and your trampy waitress.

303
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,694
Goodbye, carla.                
 It was nice working with you.

304
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,862
You, too.

305
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,198
I'd just like to say,

306
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:14,218
that men have treated me   
     like dirt all my life.

307
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,503
So?

308
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,554
I just like to say that.   
     Keeps me humble.

309
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,007
Thank you, carla.

310
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,376
Where you gonna go, hmm?

311
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:24,945
Wherever robin is.

312
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,365
I'm starting               
     a new chapter in my life.

313
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:30,034
The mrs. Robin colcord years.

314
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,403
Goodbye, sam.

315
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:38,109
Agent munson, f.B.I.

316
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:39,727
Do any of you have         
     any knowledge

317
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,030
of the whereabouts         
     of a mr. Robin colcord?

318
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,365
Why? What's the matter?

319
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:47,234
We have reason to believe      
 he's jumped bail               
 and left the country.

320
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,753
Well, why would you        
     think that?

321
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,222
Well, it seems,                
 he's destroyed                 
 his personal files,

322
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,124
wired all his money        
     to switzerland,

323
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:56,093
and flown his private jet      
 out of american air space.

324
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,628
Ok, rebecca,           
         now it's your turn.

325
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,146
Repeat after me.

326
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,682
Men have treated me        
     like dirt all my life.

327
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,820
Oh, honey--    
 oh, don't "oh, honey" me.

328
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,389
I don't need an "oh, honey."

329
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:10,758
This doesn't prove anything.

330
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,493
I think robin's            
     been framed.

331
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,648
Hey, miss howe,            
     a fax just came in         
     for you from mr. Colcord.

332
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,151
So, have any of you seen       
 colcord in the last 24 hours?

333
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,337
Look, i'm not gonna        
     say a word.

334
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,105
You could tie me               
 to a hard chair

335
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,441
and work me over               
 under hot lights all day.

336
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,993
We wouldn't do that.

337
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,110
Well, you could.

338
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,149
Especially him.

339
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,573
Oh, my god.

340
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,941
What's it say?

341
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,244
It says, um...

342
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:50,314
"dear, rebecca,            
     goodbye forever. Robin."

343
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:53,050
What does that mean, sam?

344
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,321
Well,

345
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,357
"dear, rebecca," that's you.

346
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:01,341
No.

347
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,297
I know what it means,  
         but, i mean,           
         what does it mean?

348
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:11,385
Does it mean that he left me,  
 and you were right all along,  
 and he was just using me?

349
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:12,737
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,573
I can't believe it.

351
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,675
I can't believe it.

352
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,960
I can't believe it.

353
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,778
Anything we can do?

354
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:23,680
[Sobbing]   
                    no.

355
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:29,719
You just go ahead and leave,   
 and--and i'll lock up.

356
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,288
I'm just gonna...

357
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,241
you know, cry it out.

358
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:47,104
So, how's rebecca   
            doing this morning?

359
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,673
I don't know.              
     Let's go ask her.

360
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,713
[Sobbing]

361
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,017
she looks better.

362
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,554
Uh, what the hey, cliffie. 
     She's a survivor, huh?

363
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,088
Shoot some stick?

364
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,428
Honey, you ok?

365
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:12,680
Yeah.

366
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:14,348
[Gasping]               
        i'm fine.

367
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,001
May i have                  
    another glass of water?

368
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,654
I'm starting               
     to dehydrate again.

369
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,659
You're gonna have to           
 snap out of this, sweetheart.

370
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:29,095
Why? I don't have      
         anything to live for.

371
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:33,133
Oh, come on.                   
 You got plenty                 
 to live for.

372
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:36,436
Hey, what do you think,        
 you're the only person         
 who's ever been dumped?

373
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,021
Look at sam.

374
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,608
He was in this                 
 horrible relationship          
 with this woman for years,

375
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,111
and it ended up            
     she ditched him            
     at the altar.

376
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,829
What did he do?

377
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,214
Look, he took          
         all his money,

378
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,516
he bought a boat,          
     he sank it,

379
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:52,753
then he had to             
     grovel around here         
     for tips for 3 years.

380
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,873
But look at him now.       
     He got his bar back.

381
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,542
And all he had to do           
 was turn in your boyfriend.

382
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:00,927
[Sobbing]

383
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:04,047
oh, forget it, man.            
 There's no cheering her up.

384
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:07,450
Come on, sweetheart.

385
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:09,286
You're a beautiful, 
            bright woman.

386
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,405
You got a great career.

387
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,774
Oh, there's a letter   
         for you, miss howe.

388
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,692
Why don't you just             
 go ahead and read it, woody?

389
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,547
It's probably just             
 another letter from robin      
 telling me to get lost.

390
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:22,583
Uh, no.                        
 It's from the corporation.     
 You're fired.

391
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,117
[Sobbing]           
            i'm fired!

392
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,885
I'm fired!

393
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:27,421
Oh, god!

394
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:34,211
God, they're blaming me    
     for this whole thing       
     with robin.

395
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,281
Well, actually it says here    
 they never much cared          
 for your work.

396
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,250
Woody, don't.

397
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,485
Come on,               
         what does this matter?

398
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,354
Listen, this is sammy  
         talking to you.

399
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:47,124
As long as i got a bar,        
 you--you got a place to work.

400
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:51,528
No, i don't think           
    i could go back             
    to managing this bar.

401
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,146
Oh, and i don't--       
        i wouldn't want you to.

402
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:56,066
No, i--i was thinking          
 more of you being a waitress.

403
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,684
A waitress?

404
00:18:57,752 --> 00:18:59,570
Yeah.                  
         Carla could train you.

405
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,104
[Cackling]

406
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:03,440
[sobbing]

407
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,443
boy, you know,     
             you're right.

408
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,278
There's no              
        cheering her up at all.

409
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,653
So he asked me to marry him,

410
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,288
obviously                      
 meant nothing to him.

411
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,391
He hops on his jet             
 and leaves me here to rot.

412
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,760
Can i have my drink?

413
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,729
You know,                      
 you men are all alike.

414
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,689
Yeah, so where was i?

415
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,826
Uh, you were engaged           
 to one of the richest men      
 in the world.

416
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,227
Can i just have my check?

417
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,461
Are you a man?

418
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,497
Sure.

419
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:51,789
Woody, i'm gonna need          
 some more drinks.              
         What kind?

420
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,840
Doesn't make any difference.

421
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,993
Rebecca, can i speak to you 
    for a minute, please?

422
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,461
What is it, sam?               
 Is it my break time?

423
00:19:57,795 --> 00:19:59,579
I wanna know           
         why you're driving     
         everybody out of here.

424
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,815
Why--why are you       
         attacking all the men?

425
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,083
Because they are evil slime.

426
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,619
Oh, come on.                
    Not all men are evil slime.

427
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,554
Oh, yeah, sure.                
 You would defend them.

428
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:14,761
Carla, will you please 
         take over for rebecca?

429
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,346
What's the matter              
 with that waitress?

430
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,381
She keeps throwing drinks      
 in people's face.

431
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,150
Well, she's heartbroken.

432
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,719
Her boyfriend      
             left her, and--

433
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,354
and she's feeling   
            a little bitter.

434
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:25,556
Here you go.

435
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,015
Then what's her problem?

436
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,316
She's just mean.

437
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,844
Look, i know                   
 you are going through          
 a hard time here,

438
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:50,531
but, you know,                 
 there comes a point            
 when you have to face reality.

439
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,299
I do not have to       
         listen to you.

440
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,451
Oh, would you                  
 cut that out?

441
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,886
What? What are you  
            gonna do, fire me?

442
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,821
No, wait, wait, wait.  
         I got a better idea.

443
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,823
Tell me you love me,   
         ask me to marry you,

444
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,525
skip the country,  
             and then fire me.

445
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,960
Hey, stop it!

446
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,762
I am not robin!            
     I'm not doing              
     those things to you.

447
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,799
You know something?            
 I'm sick of getting kicked     
 in the teeth

448
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,233
because someone else       
     dumped you.

449
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:11,635
Well, i am sick    
             of getting dumped.

450
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,871
I'm sick of you                
 getting dumped.

451
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,405
You know somethin'?

452
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,273
You know what i'm              
 really sick of?                
                 Your own face!

453
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:21,044
No, i'm sick of you--       
    i'm sick of you             
    getting angry at me

454
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,779
when all i'm trying to do      
 is help you.

455
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,381
Well, you can't help me.

456
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,834
I'm beyond help.

457
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:31,371
You can't help somebody        
 who's done everything wrong    
 since the day she was born.

458
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,173
Oh, stop it, will you?

459
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,025
What have i done right?

460
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:36,860
Well...

461
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,179
you got excellent taste 
        in clothes.

462
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,231
What?                          
 This old thing?

463
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,499
Well, yeah.

464
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,101
But everything else.

465
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,502
I've been wrong about men,

466
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,270
i've been wrong                
 about my career.

467
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,140
You know, if i'd just done     
 everything the opposite        
 of the way i did it,

468
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,576
i probably would've had        
 a very happy life.

469
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,928
Well, what's that  
             supposed to mean?

470
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:56,546
[Sighs]

471
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,483
it means that          
         i really loved robin,

472
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,452
and he ran off.

473
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:08,224
And the man i've been          
 pushing away all these years,

474
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,494
is right here      
             caring for me,

475
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:14,230
giving me a shoulder   
         to cry on.

476
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,133
God.

477
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:18,802
Life is so weird.

478
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,169
[Sniffs]

479
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,522
sam, kiss me.

480
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:26,309
[Gasping]              
         listen,

481
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:28,095
i think                        
 this is wrong, honey.

482
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:30,497
I said wrong is     
            what i do best.

483
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:36,637
I just--

484
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,839
i just don't want us       
     to do anything here        
     that you're gonna regret.

485
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,173
That's all.

486
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:41,541
Fine, fine.

487
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:42,809
Maybe you're right.

488
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:44,577
[Panting]

489
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:55,305
is rebecca in her office?

490
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,408
I thought you ditched her  
     and skipped the country.

491
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:58,975
I did, but i've come back.

492
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:01,111
I finally realized         
     what rebecca means to me.

493
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:03,414
What use is my money       
     or my freedom

494
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,248
if i don't have        
         the woman i love?

495
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,452
Rebecca!

496
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,353
I'm back!

497
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,922
(Robin)            
             oh, my god!
