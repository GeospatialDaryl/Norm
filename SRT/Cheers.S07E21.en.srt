00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,554
Hey, everybody!

3
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:09,891
I have a great new way     
      to promote the bar.

00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:11,960
( <i>others groaning</i> )       
             REBECCA:           
         No, no, no, no,

5
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:14,029
you're gonna like this one;   
        it's different.

6
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,731
It not only demonstrates        
social concern,

7
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,066
but it is also         
     contemporary and hip.

8
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:22,604
Now, Cheers is the bar     
          that cares.

00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,089
Therefore,              
  if you are not in condition

10
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:27,459
to drive yourself home,     
        we will appoint

11
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:30,662
a designated driver,      
        free of charge.

12
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,330
Oh, that's nice,      
          that's really nice.

13
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:37,919
So is anybody a little tipsy?

14
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:40,721
Come on,                        
don't be ashamed.

15
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,924
Does anybody feel           
      that they might have

16
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,127
the slightest difficulty    
    driving themselves home?

17
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:48,597
I might.

18
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,232
Well, hi. I'm Rebecca Howe.

19
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,235
And I would be happy to
         drive you home myself.

20
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,737
That's very nice of you.        
              Where do you live?

21
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:57,772
Philadelphia.

22
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:01,042
Well, what's    
                your address?

23
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:04,979
Eh, it's a blue house;          
I'll know it when I see it.

Frasier?

It's time to take mother    
    to her hair appointment.

35
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,265
Oh, well,                       
then we'd better hurry up

before they run out             
of her special shade of blue.

Frasier, how many times     
  have mother and I asked you

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,874
to cease and desist       
    with the snide, cliché,

You know mother's               
not like that.

41
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,379
You're right,  
                dear, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,848
Uh, I was just trying   
        to amuse my friends.

43
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,166
Geez, it wasn't
                     very funny.

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
CLIFF ( <i>chuckles</i> ):
             Well, you-you know

45
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,986
what was funny,                 
when you said you could hear

46
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,555
her perfume coming a mile away.

47
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,123

  Yeah, yeah, or the one where

48

you said, uh, she's     
          had so many facelifts,

        it was all in-in good   
                humor, you know.

51
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,818
Of course.

52
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:36,421
You know I have                 
a sense of humor                
about mother.

53
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:37,989
Now, say good-bye

Well, nothing much.

59
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,056
Oh, your car alarm's            
going off.

60
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,041
What? Someone's     
              breaking in my car

61
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,277
and you don't run in here       
          to tell me?

62
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,279
We're not talking           
    about any car here, man,

63
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:02,547
we're talking about my 'Vette!

64
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:04,149
It's a classic,         
      it's irreplaceable!

00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,585
Hey, why don't you come
          in and sit down here.

66
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,821
Sam, what about your alarm?

67
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,658
Well, you're taking care of
        that, Woody, aren't you?

68
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,026
I was?

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,395
Oh, I must be off           
    in another world.

Sammy's done it again.

71
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,519
How come he always spots        
the gorgeous ones first?

72
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:30,175
'Cause he doesn't spend
            all his time peeling
    dead skin off his elbows?

73
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,847
What, are you gonna             
do it for me?

74
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,468
So, how can I help you?

75
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,069
I'm looking for Becky Howe.

76
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:44,205
Wow, well, Becky'll 
            be here in a minute.

77
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,641
In the meantime, can    
          I interest you in a...

78
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:48,476
Sam Malone?

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,744
No, thanks.

80
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,946
But I will have           
      a Perrier with lime.      
                             Ah.

81
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,964
Sworn off the hard stuff, huh?

82
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Coming right up.

83
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:57,868
Sam.                    
                        Yeah?

84
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,370
It was nothing.                 
                     Oh, thanks.

85
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,373
Hey, listen, you know that girl 
you were talking to?            
                      Yep.

86
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,342
I swear I've seen her           
someplace before.

87
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:06,977
Well, she asked for Rebecca.    
Called her Becky.

88
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,279
Must be old friends.

89
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:10,381
Yeah, that could explain a lot.

90
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,883
What's that supposed to mean?

91
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,351
CLIFF:                          
Well, figure it out.

92
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,919
Rebecca, who doesn't date,

93
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,156
suddenly has this               
good-looking <i>friend</i> show up.

94
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,291
A slender, boyish,

95
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:23,494
female friend,                  
with whom she probably, uh,

96
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:28,432
sunbathed nude somewhere,       
perhaps on the Isle of Lesbos.

97
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:33,187
They ever get the tests back
     on that dog that bit you?

98
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,527
So, uh, where do you    
        know Becky from?

99
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,229
She's my sister.        
        I'm Susan Howe.

100
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,698
You're sisters?!

101
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,333
Well, of course!

102
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,567
God, I love sisters!

103
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:50,505
I love the whole idea      
          of sisters.

104
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,273
Well, any sister    
              of Rebecca is a...

105
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:53,908
Are there any   
                more of you?

106
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,576
Uh, afraid not.

107
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,511
Well, no, that's...
        You're more than enough.

108
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,613
( <i>laughs</i> ):   
                  Oh, wow!

109
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,399
( <i>whispers</i> ):          
        Sam, come here.

110
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,500
Let me tell     
                  you something.

111
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,701
Excuse me. What?

112
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,536
I just remembered who she is.

113
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,371
That's Susan Howe.

114
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,939
I know, she's   
            Rebecca's sister.

115
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,176
No, the actress-- I saw her     
in <i>Night of the Mutants.</i>

116
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:17,014
What, is that a movie,      
    or your family reunion?

117
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,050
A movie, Carla.

118
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,821
I don't remember, uh, 
         Rebecca saying anything

119
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,923
about having a sister who   
          was in a horror movie.

120
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,658
Are you sure about that?

121
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,727
Let me check.

122
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,429
Yeah.

123
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,067
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

124
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,237
You know, if she had            
another, smaller head

125
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:42,240
growing out of her neck,        
I'd be positive.

126
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,807
I got to check this out.

127
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:48,045
Hey, ask her if 
            they let her keep   
            the little head.

128
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:54,385
Sorry about that.   
            Uh, bar business.

129
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,903
So, what brings you to Boston?

130
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,705
I'm shooting a bank commercial.

131
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,906
Oh, I was right!

132
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,609
You <i>are</i> Susan Howe,
                    the actress.

133
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,044
I loved you in that
              two-headed movie.

134
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,413
Oh, which one?                  
I did two of them.

135
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,615
Was it the one where the head   
was coming out of my neck?

136
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:08,983
Uh, yeah, that's the one.

137
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:11,752
Oh, thank goodness,             
because the other one           
I am not proud of.

138
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,854
Oh.

139
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,759
Well, so, you're, uh,      
 you're here to see Becky, huh?

140
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,662
How long has it been
            since the two of you
                 saw each other?

141
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,398
Ooh, it must be three years.

142
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,400
We had a little... falling out.

143
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:29,103
I only hope we're grown up      
enough now to kiss and make up.

144
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:32,206
Grown-up sisters,           
     kissing and making up.

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,842
That warms my cockles.     
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )

146
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:40,247
Let's get you two gals     
    back together, shall we?

147
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,317
Will you excuse me 
             just a minute here?

148
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:46,921
CLIFF:             
So, uh, what's the bone, Jerome?

149
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:49,757
Any late-breaking   
                 bulletins here?
Yeah, oh, yeah.

150
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,892
I think I'm on to something   
         here, fellas.

151
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,645
Carla, you hate your
             sister, don't you?

152
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,132
Sure, why?

153
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,566
Well, what would I have to do

154
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,468
to get the two of you      
     back together again?

155
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,656
Simple, Sam, ask me to come down
     and identify her body.

156
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,508
She's missing the point.

157
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,844
Can you imagine what            
the reward might be

158
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:13,114
for anybody who would act as    
a peacemaker between these two

159
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:17,185
tragically estranged      
  but perky-bottomed sisters?

160
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,169
Ah...

161
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:21,539
To Sammy, the man who 
          keeps the dream alive.

162
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:23,241
CARLA:                          
Wait a minute.

163
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,343
What makes you think you    
    can get the both of them?

164
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:28,513
It's taken you two years    
    to get a polite kick in     
      the teeth from number one.

165
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,965
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
            Carla, Carla, Carla.

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,185
Am I gonna have to teach you    
about women?

167
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:40,007
Yeah, Cliff, why don't you?

168
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,044
Nah, you better take            
this one, Sammy.

169
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,480
I don't want to hog             
the spotlight.

170
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,515
Carla...

171
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:50,317
I know you don't have a lot
        of experience with this,

172
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:53,721
but sometimes women 
            get... really happy.

173
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:56,023
And when that happens,

174
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:59,059
they get all emotional
                 and vulnerable.

175
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,529
And that's when it's time   
            for a fella like me,

176
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,464
who's very sensitive    
          and caring, to move in

177
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:07,201
and give new meaning to the   
words, "triple-decker Sam-ich."

178
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,402
NORM:   
                    Hey, hey!

179
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,037
CLIFF:
                    Hey, hey!

180
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,606
Hey!                  
                      All right!

181
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,108
So, Cliff...          
                        Huh?

182
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:15,877
tell me more about women.

183
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,865
Well, all right here, uh...

184
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:23,735
They're warm and soft, and...

185
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,002
( <i>sighs</i> )

186
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,971
...when they wash their cars,   
they're dressed

187
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,641
in nothing but suds,            
a suntan and a cowboy hat.

188
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:36,380
Sorry, I must have drifted away 
there for a second.

189
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,602
( <i>sighs</i> ):
                        So...

190
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,004
Oh, whoa, wait,
                     wait, wait.

191
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,672
I've got a
            surprise for you.

192
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,274
Sam, move your hand; your       
  cologne is stinging my eyes.

193
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:49,026
Come here, come here, 
         there's someone waiting

194
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,829
to see you, and     
              you're never gonna
            guess who it is.

195
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,031
Careful, careful.   
        You are gonna love this.

196
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,968
Ta-da!

197
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,736
Susan.

198
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,606
What are you doing here?

199
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,575
I wanted to see you.

200
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,677
Well, now   
                 you've seen me.

201
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:09,480
Yep, yep, there you are.

202
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:14,285
Boy, oh, boy,          
    is this a moment.

203
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,087
Yeah, I was here on a job,

204
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,856
and I thought I'd drop in       
         and say hello.

205
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,673
Hello.

206
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,058
Good-bye.

207
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,276
Fine, I tried.

208
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,644
You are obviously           
        not interested.

209
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,813
Obviously.
             No, no!            
    Wait, wait, wait a minute.

210
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,248
Come back here.         
        Listen, listen.

211
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:29,283
You know what's happening here, 
     you're both so excited

212
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:32,186
to see each other that you're  
  getting all tensed up here.

213
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,355
I think what we need to do      
        is put ourselves

214
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,323
into a little bit           
  of a more relaxed situation.

215
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,992
I know this hot tub club

216
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,493
where we can get                
group rates.

217
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,162
I'm kidding,          
    I'm kidding about that.

218
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:43,430
What we should do is,      
     we should go upstairs,

219
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,200
and we should have lunch    
         at Melville's.

220
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,836
Just the three of us.      
What do you say? My treat.

221
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,072
Well, I did come here      
          to make up.

222
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,340
Huh?

223
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,158
I did skip breakfast.

224
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,126
All right!              
    That's the spirit!

225
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:59,263
Family! That's what made        
this country great.

226
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,031
Come on.

227
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,135
Sam...          
    Yes?

228
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,704
why are you so
             desperate to see my
        sister and I make up?

229
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,573
I mean, what    
                is it to you?

230
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,309
Is this another stupid 
        ploy to get me into bed?

231
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,143
Oh, come on, Rebecca,           
don't be ridiculous!

232
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:15,479
I'm thinking of <i>both</i> of you.

233
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,460
This is nice.

234
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,994
Rebecca, I can't finish     
        my filet.

235
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,063
Do you want the rest?

236
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,365
Why, do you want me to get fat?

237
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,566
Oh, come on,

238
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,502
you have not been fat      
  since you were 12 years old.

239
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,704
Of course, you were       
    the Goodyear blimp then.

240
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,892
At least when I gave      
  my "I am an American" speech

241
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,361
at the Flag Day assembly,       
     I did not wet myself.

242
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,430
Rebecca, I was six.

243
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:51,666
But she did, Sam, she did.

244
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,833
Shut up.                
         You shut up.

245
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,518
No, you shut up.            
    No, you shut up!

246
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,571
Shut up...!

247
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,045
This is nice.

248
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,215
You know, I really don't think  
this was such a good idea, Sam.

249
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,716
And I hope you'll   
            excuse me, Susan,

250
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,417
if I don't clean    
              your table scraps.

251
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,519
Oh, wait a minute, sit down,  
        will you, pl...?

252
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,521
Girls, girls, girls,      
    what is the big problem

253
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:16,123
between you two anyway?

254
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,592
Sam, it is one of those     
    complicated issues

255
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:21,762
that you can't just pin down  
    into one certain thing.

256
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:23,197
Well, try.

257
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:24,749
( <i>sighs</i> ):              
        All right.

258
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,250
Dan Buddinger.

259
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:29,536
Mike Dietz, Jeff Carnahan,

260
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:32,055
Ron Allen, Steve        
        Melman, Terry Toban,

261
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,924
Clay Fisher...
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

262
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,577
Does this have anything to do  
    with boy trouble?

263
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,430
Yes. The trouble is, she can't 
  keep her hands off my boys.

264
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,233
If it bothered you that much why
didn't you just take them back?

265
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,420
Because I didn't want to stoop 
         to your level!

266
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,808
Besides, I tried
             and it didn't work.

267
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,777
Look, the point is,       
that was back when we were kids.

268
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,145
A million things have changed.

269
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,947
No, no, no,           
     the fact still remains

270
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,216
that every time         
    I am attracted to a guy,

271
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,284
you are on him         
      like white on rice.

272
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,687
So excuse me if I   
        don't leap over there

273
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,773
and say forgive me,
         please, please, please,

274
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,141
for breaking    
                my heart over

275
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,375
and over and over and over.

276
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,478
Excuse me,              
I have to get out of here.

277
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,980
I have work to do.

278
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:17,067
Sam, I'm sorry                  
you had to see that.

279
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,153
Well, that's okay.

280
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:22,507
I don't think it was
         fair for Rebecca to say

281
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,511
that you tried to   
             steal every guy she
         ever got interested in.

282
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,779
But I'm warning you
              right now, missy,

283
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,498
you better not
            try that with me.

284
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,336
Oh, Rebecca's interested in you?

285
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,204
Are you kidding me?

286
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:39,273
She's got a big old
                    crush on me.

287
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:43,344
Well, I am glad to see     
she hasn't lost her good taste.

288
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:46,814
Well, that's very sweet
             of you to say that.

289
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,783
More wine?

290
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:53,287
This is nice.   
              This is very nice.

291
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,082
I snuck out of the house.

292
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,317
So don't tell Lilith.

293
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:08,519
Gee, where's Sam?

294
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,987
Oh, he'll be            
        here any minute.

295
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,756
He's still up having lunch with 
Miss Howe's sister, Miss Howe.

296
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,575
Oh, you mean Rebecca's sister's 
            in town.

297
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,228
Susan Howe,                     
the, uh, movie star.

298
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,248
You mean, <i>the</i> Susan Howe,

299
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,083
the star of           
      <i>Night of the Mutants?</i>

300
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,269
Wow.                       
                    You saw it?

301
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,905
Well, yes. Lilith and I         
rented it last week.

302
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:28,706
Oh, really?

303
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,125
You two don't seem
         the slasher-movie type.

304
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,310
Oh, well, purely for scientific 
      purposes of course.

305
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,778
But, you know,         
    this may surprise you--

306
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,313
I rather enjoyed it.

307
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,348
See, I think films with scenes

308
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:40,017
of graphic disembowelment       
         and mutilation

309
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,052
can, in some cases,       
        help people to,

310
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,421
well, release some of the fears 
        and aggressions

311
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,390
of modern society.

312
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,891
Also, it's the first time       
        Lilith's mother

313
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,727
went home before 9:00...    
        screaming.

314
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,166
Hey, everybody.

315
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,470
Oh, Miss Howe, I'm
              Dr. Frasier Crane.

316
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,904
My wife and I  
                rented your film

317
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,839
<i>Night of the Mutants</i>   
            <i>last week, and, uh,</i>

318
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,709
well, I was wondering, um...

319
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,943
could I have your autograph?

320
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,077
Ah...         
    Sure.

321
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:07,995
Thank you.

322
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,346
Uh, I tell you what,

323
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,881
just make it out to

324
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,484
"Mother Sternin."

325
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,358
And say, if you would,
          "I know where you live

326
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,893
and I'm going to get you."

327
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:28,132
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,       
    what's the skinny, huh?

328
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,134
Yeah, what's the score?
                     Two to one?

329
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:33,487
Guys, guys,                     
I know I've accomplished

330
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:36,824
some truly legendary            
feats in my day,

331
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:39,927
but this...                     
this is my masterpiece.

332
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,562
This is my Moaning Lisa.

( <i>chuckling</i> )

334
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:45,633
Okay, tell me: 
                 what's the plan

335
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,167
and how are we involved?

336
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,369
Well, here it is                
and you're not.

337
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:54,775
Turns out that these two sisters
     are very competitive--

338
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,677
especially when it come to guys.

339
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,712
So all I had to do was      
    let the little one know

340
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:00,580
that the big one        
      had the hots for me

341
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:04,284
and bingo, she was eating       
        out of my hand.

342
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:05,886
Was she wearing                 
a cowboy hat?

343
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,857
It's a figure of speech,    
            Cliffie.

344
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,525
Well, she could have been.

345
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:14,628
What I need to do now      
          is make sure

346
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,930
that the big one knows that   
  the little one is interested

347
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,499
and I will be ping-ponging      
    between the two of them

348
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,169
until they bury me          
    with a smile on my face.

Have you had her scream for you,

Later, Woody. Later.

00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,660
Okay, uh, let's 
                see, the plan is

358
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,296
that I meet you back here   
        at closing time, right?

359

Yeah, can't wait.

00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:51,799
Yeah.           
      See you then.

Oh, boy.

Yeah, it's not fair.

363
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,487
All the chicks                  
in that family

364
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,355
are loaded

What'd my family get?

Look at the bright
                    side, Carla.

Probably takes them hours 
     to get ready every morning,

                the same with or
                without makeup,

370

      to get in the middle

379
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,160
your sister                     
just asked me out.

She what?!

Yeah, is that the craziest      
        thing, or what?

382
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,601
She obviously thinks      
that I'm attracted to you.

383
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,570
Oh, come on,          
why would she think that?

 by saying something like that?

Man, this makes
                 me so furious!

388

She comes out here          
 and she says that she's sorry

389
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,482
and she wants to make up for it,

390
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,183
and then the second       
      my back is turned,

00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,753
she comes onto the guy     
  she thinks is my boyfriend.

392

If there's just something       
          you could do

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:05,989
to get back at her.

I know                          
you put off our date,

437
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,390
but I just couldn't wait

438
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:50,059
to see you.
            You're all I've been

439
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,861
thinking about today.

440
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,797
Is there someplace private      
        we can go

441
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:56,099
for a few minutes where I can...

442
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,769
touch you and hold you?

443
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,605
Um, usually I go        
  for this stuff in a big way,

444
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,340
but at the moment...

445
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,442
I'm in a little bit       
      of a time jam here.

446
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:08,144
Oh, I'm <i>so</i> in the mood.

447
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,417
And I am so good
          when I am in the mood.

448
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,251
Would you excuse me             
for a second?

449
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,487
I got to make a 
            quick phone call.

450
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,289
I'll be right back.

451
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,913
Oh, come on, Rebecca, pick up, 
pick up, pick up, please.

452
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,900
Pick up, pick   
                up, pick up.

453
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,806
As long as you're not going     
to be talking with those lips...

454
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,942
( <i>groaning</i> )
( <i>provocative chuckle</i> )

455
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,144
( <i>both moaning and chuckling</i> )

456
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,412
Oh...

457
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,181
( <i>both continue moaning</i> )

458
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,817
Sam, I'm ready                  
for our date.

459
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,253
Susan!

460
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,121
Uh, Rebecca, I
            can explain this.

461
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,489
Wait, just... Ow.

462
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,024
My finger's caught              
in your bra.

463
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,210
Listen...

464
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:59,312
You don't owe me                
an explanation.

465
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:00,848
It's Susan.

466
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:02,733
It's always been Susan.

467
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,135
My entire life,         
    it has been Susan.

468
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,203
I'm glad you saw us.

469
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,838
You deserve to be hurt.

470
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,523
Oh, no, sister.                 
                 Come on.

471
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:12,726
I don't hurt anymore;   
        I am way beyond hurt.

472
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,661
Don't be silly, now, girls,   
        please, please.

473
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:18,482
And now it is Susan Howe's turn 
            to hurt.

474
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:21,601
( <i>gasping</i> )                     
         Hey, that's a gun.

475
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:23,454
It ain't licorice.

476
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,304
No, come on, let...

477
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:25,522
Let's talk about this.

478
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:26,790
Now, this is silly.

479
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,658
No, please,           
     I'm too young to die.

480
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,109
Rebecca.                        
      ( <i>Susan screaming</i> )

481
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,145
( <i>gunshot</i> )
              Oh...!

482
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,897
Holy cow!

483
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,918
That was for Dan Buddinger.

484
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:39,720
And this is for Jeff Carnahan.

485
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:40,904
( gunshot )           
                      Oh...!

486
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,839
And Mike Dietz.

487
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,790
( gunshot )

488
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,009
And Sam Malone.

489
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,845
( <i>three gunshots</i> )

490
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,614
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

491
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,484
What did...?

492
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:55,718
What is it, Sam?

493
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:57,871
Oh!

494
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,890
What, because I killed     
        my sister?

495
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,409
Uh-huh!

496
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:05,011
I didn't mean to do that anyway.

497
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:06,613
Oh, well, it's done.

498
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,532
All right...
              we got to get this
            body out of here.

499
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,201
Wha...? Wha...?

500
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,902
You got to help me, Sam;    
            come on.

501
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,371
Come on, take a hold of her.

502
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:15,672
Come on.                        
            Oh...!

503
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:18,808
Everybody does at least one     
bad thing in their life.

504
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:21,695
Sam, take her hands.

505
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,763
There.

506
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,898
All right, now, make
            sure nobody sees us.

507
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:26,199
( whimpering )

508
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,050
Stop being a baby!

509
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,568
Oh!

510
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:30,871
Oh, boy, oh, boy...

511
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,305
Move.

512
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,743
ALL:              
             Sammy!

513
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,481
She did it.

514
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:43,249
Boy, Sammy, when you said

515
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:45,786
you were going to knock 'em off 
         one at a time,

516
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,253
you were serious.

517
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,989
Oh, no, no,           
no, you don't understand.

518
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,824
I mean, she... she's real...

519
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,076
I'm dead.                       
              ( <i>gasps</i> )

520
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,616
( <i>laughter</i> )

521
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,952
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

522
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:07,691
That wasn't funny.

523
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,826
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

524
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,111
That wasn't funny.

525
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,414
I mean, that's the kind of thing
     that could, you know,

526
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:17,116
give somebody          
     serious mental damage.

527
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:18,251
Am I right, Lilith?

528
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,769
No, it was funny, Sam.

529
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,705
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

530
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,910
Susan, Susan, you   
                were so good.

531
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:28,511
Wasn't Susan good?

532
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,448
SUSAN:                          
You were pretty good            
yourself.

533
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,422
Sam, are you all right?

534
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,690
I'm hurt.

535
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:44,611
I'm hurt and I'm...

536
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:46,346
I'm offended.

537
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,681
And quite frankly,          
        I can't believe

538
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:50,851
that you two think that     
this is some sort of silly joke.

539
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:51,785
Am I right, Norm?

540
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,953
( <i>laughing</i> ):   
                        Yeah.

541
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,712
I'm never going to
            speak to either     
              one of you again.

542
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:05,682
Oh, Sam, that's really too bad, 
  because you know, in a way,

543
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,451
fending off your stupid advances

544
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,386
brought Susan and I       
         back together.

545
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,755
We haven't been 
                this close since
                 we were kids.

546
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,022
