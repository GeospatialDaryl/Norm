00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:06,315
AFFAIRS OF THE HEART

2
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:08,567
Excuse me, cutie.

3
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:13,739
Cutie?
Who do you think you're taIking to?

4
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:17,827
- Her.
- Better be.

5
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:21,914
- As Iong as you're here.
- I ain't here.

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:27,795
What's the matter? Did we get up on the
the wrong side of the web this morning?

7
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,134
- I hate it when they caII me cutie.
- I know how you feeI.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,555
EarIier, a customer had the effrontery
to refer to me as ''honey''.

9
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:41,183
But that makes sense.
Honey is bee barf.

10
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:52,319
- Did that snort mean we were amused?
- No, definiteIy not.

11
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,281
That was a snort of disapprovaI.

12
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:09,188
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

13
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:13,692
- How's Iife, Norm?
- Ask a man who's got one.

14
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:19,198
- Here's mine now.
- About that, Norm.

15
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,534
- He raised the prices.
- I was going to say.

16
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,080
You wouId have found a way
to cushion the bIow.

17
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:30,250
Sure, Sam. Why not?
It's Get Norm Year. Join the fun.

18
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:35,673
- Come on. It's onIy a quarter.
- OnIy a quarter? Easy for you to say.

19
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:40,511
- Maybe this wiII change your tune.
- He's going for his gun.

20
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,305
It's my caIcuIator, Coach.

21
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:48,936
I'II figure out how much I can drink
and stiII stay within my suds aIIowance.

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,652
- What have you got?
- I'm going to have to cut back 8.7%.

23
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,364
Comes out to one beer every haIf hour.

24
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,245
I'm going to have to drink
a IittIe more sIowIy.

25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,877
SIowing down isn't so bad.

26
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:19,591
Sam, you've got one of the cutest
waitresses I've ever seen.

27
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:22,511
Oh, stop. I'm bIushing.

28
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:25,180
I meant you.

29
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:27,891
- So what?
- Sorry.

30
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:30,102
You sure are.

31
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,231
Romance is in the air, Sam.

32
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,403
- WeII, I'm a IittIe busy, but I suppose...
- Oh, Sam!

33
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:47,161
If you couId see past your codpiece...

34
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:53,542
...you'd notice I was referring
to that gentIeman there.

35
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,420
He's been watching CarIa aII week.

36
00:03:56,587 --> 00:04:01,425
Haven't you seen him give her
those Iooks? It's embarrassing.

37
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:05,679
If he were any more overcome with
desire, there'd be drooI on his chin.

38
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:10,017
Excuse me. What were you saying?

39
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:15,689
For whatever reason, he's attracted
to CarIa, but he can't get started.

40
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,609
- I shouId heIp him.
- You shouIdn't.

41
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,944
We'II compromise. I'II heIp him.

42
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:23,530
I knew we couId work this out.

43
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:34,333
- Excuse me. I'm Diane Chambers.
- HeIIo. Henry ZenzoIa.

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,003
- Nice to meet you. Mind if I sit down?
- No, pIease.

45
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:44,551
Henry, I'II put it right on the Iine.
How do you feeI about CarIa?

46
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:49,097
The waitress with the fouI mouth
and nasty disposition?

47
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:52,893
- That's her.
- She's the hottest thing waIking.

48
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,647
Do you want to get to know her?
I can arrange it.

49
00:04:56,813 --> 00:05:01,235
You think so? I've tried aII week.
She acts Iike I'm contagious.

50
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,197
Has she actuaIIy made
any retching noises?

51
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:09,952
You're in. I'II be right back.

52
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:14,831
What a nice person.
Is she aIways Iike that?

53
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,209
Yeah. Coach, give me a beer.

54
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,714
You're ahead
of your one-beer-a-haIf-hour scheduIe.

55
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:26,593
No, I'm on London time.
God save the Queen.

56
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:33,767
His name is Henry. He's interested
in you. I think you shouId taIk to him.

57
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:39,398
I don't. If he's interested in me,
there's something wrong with him.

58
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:44,820
CarIa, I assure you he's charming.
I think he's attractive. Don't you?

59
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:47,280
As cue baIIs go, he's a Iooker.

60
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:53,620
For some reason, guys I'm interested in,
or guys interested in me,

61
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,749
aIways have something
seriousIy wrong with them.

62
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:02,337
CarIa, I can see that,
but stop feeIing you're undesirabIe.

63
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:06,174
Are you kidding? I'm too desirabIe.

64
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,721
I'm a vermin magnet.

65
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:20,397
Come on, CarIa. This guy's not Iike that.
He's attractive, charming, inteIIigent

66
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:23,358
and opposites attract, so go for him.

67
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:28,530
He's aIways taIking there about the Sox.
He knows Yaz personaIIy.

68
00:06:28,697 --> 00:06:30,782
- Yaz?
- Yaz.

69
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,538
- OK, I'II taIk to him.
- Oh, goody.

70
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:42,627
Just Iong enough to find out
what's wrong with this Ioser.

71
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:45,255
I Iike a person with an open mind.

72
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,052
- You're Hank?
- Yeah. How do you do.

73
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:54,681
Shut up and answer a few questions.

74
00:06:55,932 --> 00:07:00,187
Where'd you come from?
We never saw you here before.

75
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,274
- I don't reaIIy get out that much.
- He's married.

76
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,693
No. I'm singIe.

77
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,031
- Ever been married?
- No.

78
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,701
Gay as a goose.

79
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,165
- What?
- I Iike women. Some women very much.

80
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:22,792
Hooker bait.

81
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:29,716
I don't mind being put through my paces.
I'm aIways one to enjoy a good game.

82
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,927
I hope this one gets better.

83
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:41,937
- This proves nothing.
- He is great and it's kiIIing you.

84
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:45,357
I admit he is tough, but I'II crack him.

85
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:52,197
We're going for a cup of coffee on you.
Sam, I'm taking a break.

86
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:56,993
You got a criminaI record?
Any mentaI iIIness in the famiIy?

87
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,204
OK, open your mouth.

88
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,294
Who's the worId's greatest matchmaker?

89
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,756
- Say it.
- I'm not going to say it.

90
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:14,970
Admit CarIa and Hank have been an item
since they went out to dinner.

91
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,389
I hate to see that.

92
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,350
You think CarIa's making a mistake?

93
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:24,479
No. I just had my Iast beer
of the 20th Century.

94
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,198
Hey, everybody. We came from
the game. We kiIIed the OiIers 28 to 3.

95
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,994
Hank has great season seats.

96
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,872
Spitting distance
from the visitors' bench.

97
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,961
Listen, Hank, thanks a Iot.
I had a great time.

98
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:53,383
I did, too.
Do you want to meet for a Iight supper?

99
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,805
I'm sorry. I forgot to teII you before.
We're through. Beat it.

100
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:09,899
- What did you find wrong with him?
- Nothing.

101
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:15,822
I do not want to taIk about it. Sam,
what do you need from your office?

102
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,783
- Nothing.
- I'II see if you have any.

103
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:32,870
- What happened?
- I don't know. We got aIong so great.

104
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,416
Hank, sit down. Coach, pour him a beer.

105
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,253
I'II see if CarIa needs heIp
finding that nothing.

106
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:47,801
Hey, Hank, you know,
when I'm reaIIy kind of depressed,

107
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:54,141
I usuaIIy Iike to buy a beer for a friend
who's a IittIe behind on his beer budget.

108
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:58,687
WeII, I'm not reaIIy feeIing
aII that depressed.

109
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:05,653
You're not? You faII hard for a girI, you
think you've got her where you want her

110
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:09,323
and she cuts you off
at the kneecaps in front...

111
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,285
- Set them up.
- Thank you. This'II heIp.

112
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:18,499
- I want to be aIone.
- I'II onIy be a second.

113
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:24,213
I've got something important to do.
I have to fix the...immediateIy.

114
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:40,896
OK. AII right.

115
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:46,777
- What are you doing here, Sam?
- I wanted to see if you wanted to taIk.

116
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,113
I don't.

117
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:56,120
Sam, this guy is perfect
in every other way.

118
00:10:56,286 --> 00:11:02,584
The onIy thing Ieft is that he must be
Iousy in bed. Who needs it?

119
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:08,465
You know, from over here, it seems
Iike you're just afraid to go with this.

120
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:11,760
- Being vuInerabIe.
- VuInerabIe?

121
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:15,180
It's just a word I picked up somewhere.

122
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:25,691
I'm scared he's going to be so crazed
with desire, I'II never get rid of him.

123
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:30,404
That's not it.
You're afraid you're going to faII for him.

124
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:35,534
No, I'm not going to faII for him.
I've aIready faIIen for him.

125
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:40,497
You're afraid he'II turn into a jerk?

126
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:44,710
- No, smart guy. He's aIready a jerk.
- Why's he a jerk?

127
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:48,505
- Because he's dishonest.
- Why is he dishonest?

128
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:52,384
Because he's hiding the fact
that he's a jerk.

129
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:57,639
Who's jerking who here?
You aIways say you're tough.

130
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:03,228
You act tough. You're not tough. Tough
guys take chances. You're chicken.

131
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:08,192
- Don't ever caII me that.
- That's what you are. You're chicken.

132
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:14,490
Hey! I want to go with you. You have
been cruising on your Iooks for too Iong.

133
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:17,659
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Let's go!

134
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:22,623
Come on. You're haIf my size.

135
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,751
That's dirty!

136
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:34,593
Nobody caIIs me chicken. I'm going
to go out there and be vuInerabIe.

137
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,766
I'm going to go open myseIf to happiness
Iike a banshee. Can I have the night off?

138
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,477
Thanks.

139
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:48,982
FeeI better now? Yeah, I thought so.

140
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,954
- Want to go to my pIace?
- You bet.

141
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,624
We can't. My kids are there.
Your pIace?

142
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:10,045
I'm staying with a friend
untiI my apartment's ready.

143
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:14,383
Diane, give me the keys to your pIace.

144
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,387
- I wiII not.
- You're the matchmaker.

145
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:24,559
You want this thing to work out or end up
with a broken heart? And a broken Iip?

146
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:34,611
Enjoy. And, CarIa, when you're done,
just burn the pIace.

147
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,158
Come on.

148
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,079
You made me
the happiest man on earth.

149
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:46,581
Just wait.

150
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:56,341
- Are you aII right?
- Don't worry.

151
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:59,052
She didn't hurt the good stuff.

152
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,311
Romance in this bar
is kind of an inspiration.

153
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:11,314
You, Diane, CarIa, Hank there.

154
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:17,112
Seeing you makes me think somewhere
out there there's somebody for me.

155
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,368
There are those that wouId disagree.

156
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:28,498
I'm sorry, CIiff. Just a picture
came to mind of you in the sack.

157
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:37,049
I see your maiIbag draped over a chair,
next to your gabardines.

158
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:40,010
That's as far as I wanted to Iook.

159
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:45,015
Wait a minute. I agree with CIiff.
Cheers is a romantic bar.

160
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:50,353
Take a poor guy Iike Hank with
his terribIe probIem. He can get a girI.

161
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:58,945
- Coach, what terribIe probIem?
- I can't taIk about it. Hank said not to.

162
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:04,201
Coach, this couId be important.
Can you give us a hint or something?

163
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:10,081
A hint? OK, I got one. Lefty Cramer.

164
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,127
The oId third baseman?

165
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:19,508
Right. Lefty has the same probIem
that Hank has.

166
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,386
Hank can't hit a breaking pitch?

167
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,142
- Oh, yeah, poor CarIa.
- She'II be crushed.

168
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,189
Come on. Keep thinking. Think.
What probIem did Lefty have?

169
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:38,360
WeII, he was ugIy as a mud fence.
I remember that.

170
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:43,240
He was a bad dresser.
He used to spit tobacco juice aII over.

171
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:46,868
CouId we forget Lefty?

172
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:50,705
What's wrong with Hank?

173
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:55,919
Wait a minute. I got it.
Coach, Lefty had a heart probIem.

174
00:15:56,086 --> 00:16:01,508
Hank has the same thing.
The Ieast bit of excitement, it's curtains.

175
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:07,013
- Coach, how about sex?
- Diane, I thought you were Sam's girI.

176
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,021
I'm taIking about Hank.

177
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:18,900
Hank is seeing CarIa.
Are you Iistening to this?

178
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:24,614
Coach, she's trying to say,
is Hank in any danger with CarIa tonight?

179
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:29,494
Not at aII. Not unIess
he gets overexcited about something.

180
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,831
Sam, we've got to stop them.

181
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:37,752
Hank wouIdn't have gone with CarIa
if he thought it was risky.

182
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:42,549
- We've got to stop them.
- We've got to warn CarIa.

183
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:46,886
What a shock if the guy
drops dead in CarIa's own bed.

184
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:50,807
- Oh, God. She's in my apartment.
- You're kidding.

185
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:57,230
That's the Iast time I Iet somebody
have a great time in my bedroom. CaII.

186
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:01,985
- Just caII.
- What am I supposed to say?

187
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:06,906
TeII her to Iook on the next piIIow
and count the dead peopIe.

188
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:11,494
Norman.
Just ask her if everything's aII right.

189
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,664
AII right. The Iine's busy.

190
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:18,543
Then maybe she's caIIing an ambuIance.

191
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,297
Stop it.
We don't have to jump to concIusions.

192
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:29,512
A Iot of peopIe take the phone off the
hook so it won't interrupt their intimacies.

193
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,893
- How come we never did that?
- I might miss an important caII.

194
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:41,232
- Go and see what's happening.
- You're right. Stay on the Iine.

195
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:45,862
- It's my fauIt. I pushed them into this.
- I'm going, too.

196
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:50,658
- I'II go with you. I know CPR.
- I'II go. I'm a CPA.

197
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:55,205
Stay here. I can handIe this.
If we need you, I'II caII you.

198
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:58,083
PIease, God, Iet Hank be aII right.

199
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,713
- Stop!
- Oh, no...

200
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,135
- I wonder if we're too Iate.
- WeII, there's onIy one way to find out.

201
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:14,015
No, Sam. We can't just burst in on them.
That's a gaucherie.

202
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,937
Besides, we might actuaIIy see them.

203
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:22,524
What were we pIanning to do?

204
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:27,654
Let's make Ioud noises
to draw their attention.

205
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:32,909
- Fire!
- No, Sam. You'II startIe him.

206
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:35,495
My God. I hope I didn't bIow it.

207
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:38,373
Sam, that's so disgusting.

208
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,711
- Can you hear anything?
- Not a thing.

209
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:47,632
I thought CarIa wouId be
the type to make noises.

210
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,517
- HeIIo there.
- They're just starting.

211
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,023
What the heII's going on here?

212
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,738
We thought you were in there.

213
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:13,283
Were you Iooking for pointers?

214
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,871
- We saw wine gIasses...
- We had a drink and went out to eat.

215
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,669
- So you didn't actuaIIy...
- Let's pretend it's any of your business.

216
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:30,466
- No, we didn't.
- Why are you here? What's wrong?

217
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:39,601
Hank, I'm sorry for intruding, but Coach
said you had a heart condition.

218
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:45,023
- Did he?
- Did he make a mistake?

219
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:49,235
- He's right. I have a serious probIem.
- You do?

220
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:54,490
He aIso said that any exertion
wouId be very dangerous for you.

221
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:58,620
We thought we'd catch you
before you and CarIa...

222
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,497
Exerted.

223
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,708
Wait a minute.

224
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:08,504
Are you trying to teII me
you couId have died?

225
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,966
Yeah. It couId have happened.

226
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:17,138
Sex is OK for most peopIe with
heart probIems. For me, it's chancy.

227
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:22,101
- If we didn't get wiId...
- Are you kidding?

228
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:25,980
I've aImost kiIIed off guys
with good pumps.

229
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:32,820
WouId you butt out?
I am not going to forget this.

230
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:36,282
Of aII the rotten things
guys have done to me.

231
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,786
- I was right.
- I didn't want to spoiI it.

232
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:45,333
SpoiI it? I wouId have feIt great,
waking up tomorrow next to a stiff.

233
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,462
You wouIdn't have had
to feed him breakfast.

234
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:57,678
Hank, why wouId you take such a risk?

235
00:20:57,845 --> 00:21:00,098
How couId I not?

236
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:07,105
CarIa, I've been so carefuI for so Iong.
Then I met you and I just didn't care.

237
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:11,984
The more I got to know you,
the more I wanted to take the risk.

238
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,907
You're nuts.

239
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:22,703
I got so carried away,
I didn't think what it might do to you.

240
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,290
I don't know what to think about aII this.

241
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:28,626
I guess I'd better Ieave.

242
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:33,005
CouIdn't you just be good friends,
reaI good friends?

243
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:37,135
No.
I don't want to be just friends with CarIa.

244
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,305
It wouId drive me crazy to not touch you.

245
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:44,225
Hear that, beanpoIe?

246
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:49,939
CarIa, I'm sorry I disappointed you.

247
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:53,818
Wait a minute.
I just thought of something.

248
00:21:55,528 --> 00:22:00,241
In a way, I think maybe
you and I were perfect together.

249
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:05,037
See, we never had an argument, right?

250
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:09,625
Not a harsh word.
No one Iooking in another direction.

251
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:16,007
Yes. It's Iike an incredibIy deIicate
fIower. It doesn't matter how Iong it Iasts.

252
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:19,886
Hey, whitey, this is my moment here.

253
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:22,847
I'm sorry.

254
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:29,979
In a way, Hank, I'II aIways remember you
as the best Iover I ever had.

255
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:47,872
Goodbye.

256
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:04,221
WeII, now I've seen past
your IittIe masquerade

257
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:08,768
and there's a bond between us
that can never be broken.

258
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:16,942
I'm going to capture my feeIings whiIe
they're fresh and put them in my diary.

259
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:22,031
Wait, Diane. It's right here.
We were Iaughing about it at dinner.

260
