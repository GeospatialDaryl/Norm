1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,717
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,956
Oh, no.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,599
It's almost 5:00.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,153
What's the problem
with 5:00, Woody?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,834
Well, every day at 5,
this guy comes in

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,151
and blabbers and blabbers
and talks my ear off.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,073
- I don't know what to do.
- Why don't you do what I do.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,913
Tell him to shut his fat, ugly mouth.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,355
Oh, no, it's not Mr Clavin.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,278
Woody, Woody.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,829
Calm yourself. There's
no need for concern.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,117
I'm sure he's just a lonely man
who wandered in here one day

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,872
and found a sympathetic ear.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,632
Unfortunately, indulging him
will only aggravate the problem.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,554
You see, people in this situation have
a tendency to prattle on endlessly,

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,438
totally unaware of how
others are receiving

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,830
this unwanted, innocuous information.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,999
Now, the next time
a neurotic personality such as this

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,997
gets off on one of these jags,

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,151
just turn your back and walk away.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,796
Because, you see,
the important thing is, well...

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,988
Well, just a second, I was...

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,748
Oh, you merry band.

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,839
- Diane here yet?
- No, no.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,389
Miss Tardy-Slip is late again.

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,032
She probably stopped somewhere

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,795
to think up another lame-o excuse
for being late in the first place.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,109
I'm sorry I'm late.

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,791
I was taking a nap,
and I forgot to set my alarm.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,633
And my down comforter
felt so toasty.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,429
Well, you know me.
I'm something of a slumber cat.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,159
Jack Dalton called.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,839
Oh, my God. Jack Dalton?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,117
I haven't heard that name for months.
Jack Dalton.

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,710
- Who is he?
- Nobody.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,109
Well, Mr Nobody just landed
his private jet at Hyannis Port

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,669
and is coming over
to see you right now.

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,990
You never mentioned this guy
to me. How come?

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,039
Well, there's not much to say.
He's a man I dated a bit in Europe.

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,117
Was that before or after
you dumped Dr Crane

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
and sent him into
an alcoholic tailspin?

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,632
After.

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,314
How long after?

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,959
Days.

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,351
I met Jack at the running of the bulls
in Pamplona.

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,319
Isn't that just like a woman?

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,311
While I wept bitterly
into the Adriatic,

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,359
she was busy dodging bovines
in sunny Spain.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,114
Frasier, I was upset.
I would have done anything.

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,270
I wasn't running to Jack,
I was running away from you.

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,149
Well, I feel better now.

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,233
As fortune would have it,
Jack came into my life at that point,

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,712
and his love of danger
intoxicated me.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,838
If he said, "Let's try
the luge run at St Moritz,"

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,592
I said, "Why not."

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,397
I guess for a brief while,
I was danger's mistress.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,355
Is there anyone whose mistress
you weren't?

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,274
Put a cork in it, Frasier.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,515
Jack is from a period in my life
that I would

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,513
rather put behind me.
I'm more mature now.

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,352
More centred.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
Sam, I'm going to hide in the back.

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,993
When Jack comes,
just tell him I'm dead.

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,838
Chambers!

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,599
Jack.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,436
Diane's dead.

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,115
- Still light as a bird, huh?
- Oh, Jack.

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,714
Listen, I want you
to meet everybody.

69
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,393
This is Carla Tortelli.

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,750
Tortelli!

71
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,037
Easy, Hercules. I just had chilli.

72
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,159
- I'm Woody Boyd.
- Boyd!

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,038
- I'm Cliff Clavin.
- Clavin!

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,357
Norm Peterson.

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,391
Norm.

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,038
I got a whistle to wet.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,475
Hey, barkeep,

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,631
how'd you like to arm-wrestle me
for a beer?

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,994
Hey, all right!

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,918
Alrighty, but I have to warn you,

81
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,390
I was arm-wrestling champion
of Posey County.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,477
- Fair enough.
- All right.

83
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,399
One, two, three...

84
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,669
Ladies and gents,
the new champ of Posey County.

85
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,032
All right, who's next?

86
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,229
Thanks, not me.

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,239
You look like you could give me
a run for my money.

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,271
I think I'll take a rain check.

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,233
Come on, man,
just for the sport of it.

90
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,197
Jack, I'll buy you the beer.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,191
You don't have to beat
everybody in the bar.

92
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,313
What makes you think
I'm gonna lose?

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,516
Sam Malone here.
I'm the owner of the bar,

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,352
and I've yet to lose a beer in it.

95
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,154
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,276
One, two, three...

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,156
So how long you in town for?

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,875
Just for the day. I'm on my way
to the Air Races in Reno.

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,197
Reno? Yeah, that's lovely
this time of year.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,318
Beautiful.

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,670
Well, I guess I owe you a beer here.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,788
Diane, how the hell are you?

103
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,631
I'm fine. I'm fine.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,552
My God, you look pale.

105
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,757
You folks should've seen her
frolicking in the surf at Mykonos.

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,673
Her little bottom was
as brown as a berry.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,273
The stick running around
buck-naked?

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,151
- It was a semiprivate beach.
- Used to be a semiprivate bottom.

109
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,397
So, Jack, what's been happening
with you lately?

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,950
Oh, nothing much.
I spent most of last year in Tibet

111
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,954
centring my consciousness with
secrets from the Book of the Dead.

112
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,639
Fun place, Tibet.

113
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,671
I studied under this Buddhist monk

114
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,593
who had such a pixyish
sense of humour.

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,151
I remember this one
particular morning.

116
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,709
We were clad in goatskin.

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,310
The sun was just coming
over the Himalayas.

118
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,640
At that moment I took my first trip
out of my body to nirvana.

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,752
A trip like that
could well be deductible.

120
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,515
See, well, I'm a CPA.

121
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,591
Unemployed CPA.

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,320
Kind of a funny, unemployed CPA.

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,399
Mr Dalton, you've had so many bizarre
and terrifying experiences.

124
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,909
Some people say that I have
a death wish. Far from it.

125
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,279
- I have a life wish.
- Yeah, so does Normie.

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,557
- What, what, what?
- He wishes he had one.

127
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,078
Hey, Chambers!
Come on, tell us all about you.

128
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,117
Now, the last time I saw you,

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,357
you turned down my offer
to travel around the world

130
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,432
because you had a secret love
back in Boston.

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,953
Baseball player, wasn't it?

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,754
Yes, Mickey Mantle.
It didn't work out.

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,674
I always say the best remedy
for unrequited love

134
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,957
is a trip around the world on a raft.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,912
Sound tempting?

136
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,752
Jack, I feel kind of settled now.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,718
I'll admit that when
you knew me in Europe,

138
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,111
it was important for me
to test myself that way.

139
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,635
And I was rather fearless.

140
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,918
But that was the nadir
of my existence.

141
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,795
My life now is complete and happy,
and I'm scared of my own shadow.

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,797
Well, the least you can do
is give me this evening.

143
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,155
Come on, take a spin
in my new plane.

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,157
I'll show you what that baby can do.

145
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,039
Hey, what kind of aircraft
you got up there, Dalton?

146
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,633
Messerschmitt? Fokker?

147
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,473
No, it's a Bobcat

148
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,070
with a couple of Pratt & Whitney
JT1 5D-1A engines.

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,834
Twenty-two hundred pounds
of thrust apiece.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,150
Hey, good little birdy.

151
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,918
Come on, Diane, let's go.

152
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,919
Jack...

153
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,116
...thank you for your kind invitation,

154
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,637
but Sam couldn't possibly let me go
at the beginning of my shift.

155
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,195
Oh, hey, it's kind of slow tonight.
Why don't you go.

156
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,156
May I speak with you
a moment, Sam?

157
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,791
I'd really rather not go flying tonight.

158
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,748
- What?
- Sam, please.

159
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,277
Tell him I have to work tonight,
and I couldn't possibly accompany him.

160
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,118
I have a better idea.
Why don't you do it.

161
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,670
You were his berry-bottomed baby.

162
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,156
Maybe you're right.

163
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,830
It's up to me.

164
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,596
Oh, Jack.

165
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,278
I think it would be better
if I didn't go out with you tonight.

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,313
No, no, no. Say it ain't so.

167
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,318
The crazy, impulsive Diane
I knew in Europe

168
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,396
has turned into Miss Nine-to-Five,
Play-lt-Safe, Dare-l-Eat-a-Peach?

169
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,474
What a shame.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,116
So long, Diane.

171
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,272
- Well, you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

172
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,193
I'm just sad at what's lost.

173
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,636
The army of dullness
has recruited another soul.

174
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,596
Well, a little spin doesn't sound so bad.
It's a very clear night.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,028
Hey!

176
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,959
Does the woman ever say no?

177
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,716
Only to you.

178
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,398
Jack, just one thing.

179
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,710
Would you mind
if Sam accompanies us?

180
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,433
Wait, how'd I get on board this thing?

181
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,596
May I speak with you again?

182
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,478
What do you want?

183
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,469
Sam, it would mean
a great deal to me

184
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,392
if you came along for protection.

185
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,673
He's not the kind of man
I trust myself to be alone with.

186
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,638
Oh, yeah. Like me, you mean?

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,831
You do understand.

188
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,110
Okay, all right.

189
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,396
Jack? I guess I'm coming along.

190
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,516
Hey, the more the merrier.

191
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,989
- Malone!
- Don't do that.

192
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,872
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, I guess so.

193
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,189
Hey, you know, Dalton,

194
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,749
a spin up in that little birdy of yours
sure sounds inviting.

195
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,435
- Yeah, they'll tell you all about it.
- Yeah, I guess they will.

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,595
This is truly lovely.

197
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,516
The moon and stars
our only companions

198
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,672
as we gently brush aside
the billowing clouds.

199
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,273
- Diane, take the controls.
- What? What'd you say?

200
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,670
Me? I know nothing about flying.

201
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,916
Well, just put both hands
on this like this.

202
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,793
That's right. Attagirl.

203
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,190
Okay, I heard something
rattling around in back there.

204
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,998
Gotta go secure it.

205
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,469
Come on, Sam.
Why don't you sit up there.

206
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,552
That's it.
Come on, the view's great.

207
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,314
Okay, now, just fly her
steady as she goes.

208
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,789
Don't touch any controls.
Don't touch anything.

209
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,428
You're headed in the right direction.

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,797
Hi, Diane.

211
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,714
Hey, Jack? What do you call
this steering-wheel thing here?

212
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,235
It's called a steering wheel.

213
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,675
No, I'm just kidding.
It's called a yoke.

214
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,195
A bad yoke.

215
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,235
This is so frightening.

216
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,719
And yet exhilarating.

217
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,313
It's okay. It's okay.

218
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,354
I think we're getting
the hang of this, Sam.

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,677
Yeah. Yeah.

220
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,598
Feeling pretty powerful, huh?

221
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,033
Well, I have to admit,
I kind of feel like I own the sky.

222
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,598
- Jack is really something, isn't he?
- Are you kidding me?

223
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,557
I mean...

224
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,676
...I could do all that macho stuff
if I wanted to,

225
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,876
but it wouldn't make me
any more of a man.

226
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,153
Do I detect a hint
of raised consciousness?

227
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,993
Yeah. I mean, a real guy
doesn't have to jump on sharks

228
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,232
and dodge poison darts
just to prove he's a guy.

229
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,350
I'm astonished.

230
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,717
A real guy just has to score heavy
with the babes, that's all.

231
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,833
Hey, Jack.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,275
Hey, Jack, you know,
I have to admit, you're right.

233
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,510
This is kind of fun.

234
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,592
Jack? Yo, Jack?

235
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,873
Well, he couldn't have gone too far.
Unless he bailed out.

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,792
- Jack?
- Jack?

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,470
Sam? He's dead.

238
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,756
- What do you mean dead?
- I mean "dead," dead.

239
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,876
- He hasn't got a pulse.
- Oh, come on.

240
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,951
I can't believe a guy
like that's ever gonna die.

241
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,390
Yeah? Well, trust me.

242
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,355
Like hell I will.

243
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,751
We're going to crash.
We're going to die.

244
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,277
They'll check out our dental records
to identify our remains.

245
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,629
And I haven't been to Dr Oberding
for as much as a polish

246
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,791
in over six months.

247
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,473
- He's dead.
- I know, dead.

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,519
Okay.

249
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,352
All right, but we're not dead yet.

250
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,839
No, no, no, no, no, no.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,752
All right.
All right, I saw this movie once

252
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,549
where this perfectly ordinary lady
had to land this airliner.

253
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,951
So all we gotta do now is make radio
contact with some guy on the ground,

254
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,192
and he'll talk us down
onto the runway.

255
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,271
What do you remember?
Wait, what do you remember?

256
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,950
I remember thinking that, "These
people are in a lot of trouble."

257
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,630
Sam, we're going to die.

258
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,355
Hey, hey. Do you mind, please?
I'm in complete control here, Diane.

259
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,670
I just gotta find the damn radio,
that's all.

260
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,879
How do you know
which one is the radio?

261
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,155
- I don't.
- Will you stop

262
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,595
indiscriminately pushing buttons?

263
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,110
Oh, my God. I don't wanna die.

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,430
- You're not making this any easier.
- We're too young.

265
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,955
Just relax, will you?
I mean, we're still flying, aren't we?

266
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,032
We're still going
in a basically straight line here.

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,875
And we got plenty of fuel, according
to the fuel-gauge thing there.

268
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,391
That's a clock.

269
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,671
Well, all right. It's early.

270
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,031
We've still got a lot of time
to sort this whole thing out.

271
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,556
Damn.

272
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,748
You're right, you're right.
We're still aloft.

273
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,275
Maybe somebody will pick us up
on their radar or something

274
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,273
and talk us down,
and everything will be wonderful.

275
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,876
- Oh, Sam, what did you do?
- I don't know.

276
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,951
Well, don't do it again.
We're sinking.

277
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,556
No, don't be silly.
Ships sink. Planes...

278
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,520
All right, I'm gonna pull back
on this thing here. Right here.

279
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,033
Okay, here I go. All right?

280
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,918
- Oh, this is good.
- All right. All right.

281
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,229
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is good.

282
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,992
- Yeah, yeah.
- Absolutely wonderful.

283
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,750
Okay, all right.
All right, now we're back.

284
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,512
Normal here.

285
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,910
I'm just gonna keep looking
for this damn radio.

286
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,390
Please, please, please,
please, please.

287
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,632
- Look out!
- Will you stop that!

288
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,519
People don't fly well when people
are screaming in their ears.

289
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

290
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,952
Good God, please, please.
Oh, God, please.

291
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,596
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

292
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,598
- Sam, I think we're going down.
- Yeah, I think so too.

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,558
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

294
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,439
All right. All right. All right.

295
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,957
Let's just have a little dignity here
and try to be calm, huh?

296
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,678
- How do we do that?
- Oh, Jesus.

297
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,513
I don't know. I don't know.
Talk about something.

298
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,432
- Like what?
- Anything. Talk about anything.

299
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,752
Talk about all the good things
that have happened to us, huh?

300
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,351
Good things?

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,239
What about all the things
that are never gonna happen?

302
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,836
I'm never gonna get married.
I'm never gonna have a baby.

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,879
I'm never gonna get old.
I don't even have a grey hair.

304
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,477
- Sure you do, right there.
- I do? Where?

305
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,350
- Oh, please, please.
- Sam, hold me.

306
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,829
Oh, God.

307
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,350
Oh, it would have been us
one of these days, wouldn't it?

308
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,351
You and me married?

309
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,358
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,113
- Little Sams and Dianes running...
- Oh, yeah.

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,479
Oh, God.

312
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,632
Why didn't I ask you
when I had the chance?

313
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,514
- Why did I go to Europe?
- Oh, it's okay.

314
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,557
- At least we're going together.
- Yeah.

315
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,796
I love it.

316
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,910
Jack, what the hell
are you doing alive?

317
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,077
Dalton, fly the damn plane.

318
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,832
It was a little trick I learned in Tibet.

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,197
I slowed my metabolism down
to a heartbeat a minute.

320
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,272
- Why the hell did you do that, Jack?
- Fly the damn plane, will you, man.

321
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,510
- This is about to crash.
- Oh, we're not gonna crash.

322
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,353
- We're at 20,000 feet.
- Big deal, Jack.

323
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,718
Hey, relax, folks.
You were on autopilot the whole time.

324
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,558
Well, you were when I left.

325
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,429
Who's been screwing around
with the controls here, huh?

326
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,988
That was the rottenest, stupidest,
sleaziest thing anyone's ever done.

327
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,192
Chambers, I saw comfortable
and safe and domestic

328
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,590
written all over your face tonight
and couldn't stand it.

329
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,591
You needed this. You too, Malone.

330
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,034
You needed a step to the brink.

331
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,156
You needed to look into
the gaping maw of death

332
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,799
and live to tell about it.

333
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,599
I'm gonna stick my fist
in your gaping maw.

334
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,796
Oh, no, you won't.
You'll live to thank me.

335
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,473
From this day forward, you're reborn.

336
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,676
Everything in your life's
gonna be better.

337
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,110
- You're crazy.
- Food is gonna taste better.

338
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,311
- I don't care.
- Flowers are gonna smell better.

339
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,517
- You're nuts.
- Sex is gonna feel better.

340
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,193
Well, I never want to see you again
as long as I live.

341
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,078
You're a big, dangerous baby,
Jack Dalton.

342
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,516
- That's right, yeah.
- And regressing at a rapid pace.

343
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,274
You know something? You know,
I feel like punching your lights out.

344
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,113
Sam. Sam, he's the only one that
knows how to land the plane.

345
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,874
That's right.
Okay, all right, all right.

346
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,715
Yeah, but when we get on the ground,
you are dog meat, friend.

347
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,432
So, Sam, you never did tell us
how you got that shiner.

348
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,840
We hit some turbulence there,
and l...

349
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,719
...knocked myself into
the alta-gyroscope thing.

350
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,436
Oh, boy, when are they ever gonna
recess those things, huh?

351
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,353
Is that gizmo there
in the shape of a fist?

352
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,793
All right, so Dalton caught me
with a sucker punch.

353
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,872
- Yeah, but you should see him.
- We got even.

354
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,315
We told the FAA on him.

355
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,510
So, what did you guys talk about when
you thought you were gonna die?

356
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,828
Oh, I don't know...

357
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,878
You remember anything, Diane?

358
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,153
Not a word.

359
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
There were a lot of frightening
things going on.

360
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,318
Well, I'm kind of tired.
I'm gonna get ready to go.

361
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,274
Well, you know, Normie,
all this talk of danger

362
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,557
has inspired me to go out
and do something really crazy, eh?

363
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,635
What do you say you and me

364
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,394
go out and ring some doorbells
and run away, eh?

365
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,549
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,196
Mind if I get going, Sam?

367
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,396
In ten minutes, my sitter's
going on overtime,

368
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,312
and my kids ain't worth
a buck an hour.

369
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,117
- Go, go. Yeah.
- Thanks. You're a pal.

370
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,239
Hey, Sam, I want you to know,

371
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,795
if I'm ever in a life-or-death situation

372
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,794
and things look hopeless,
like there's no way of getting out alive,

373
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,996
I want you there with me.

374
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,992
Thanks, buddy.

375
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,039
No, no, wait.
Don't leave me here with...

376
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,999
Where did everybody go?

377
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,831
Oh, home, I guess.

378
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,310
- Well, I guess I'll do the same.
- Yeah.

379
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,630
Quite a night, right, Sam?

380
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,995
Yeah, quite a night.

381
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,352
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

382
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,193
Look, Sam...

383
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,155
...some things were said between us
that have never been said before.

384
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,869
And they were said
because we were facing death.

385
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,516
And now that the crisis is over,

386
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,558
I think we should set aside
some of those things

387
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,988
for when we can
better deal with them.

388
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,673
What I'm trying to say is

389
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,116
that I think we should,
for the time being,

390
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,192
forget what was said on that plane.

391
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,789
Hey, what plane, huh?

392
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,231
The plane where you said
your deepest desire was to marry me.

393
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,838
Oh, yeah, that plane.
