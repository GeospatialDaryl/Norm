00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,138
Oh, shoot!

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,973
It's a minus!
I'm not pregnant.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,575
Well, we only started
trying last night.

5
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:10,676
I guess
we can't expect

6
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,144
to get pregnant
the first time.

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,245
Well, I thought
that's what the fourth

8
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,181
and fifth times were for.

9
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,584
Fifth time.
You imagine that?

10
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,086
I'm only up to three.

11
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,157
I just want to be
pregnant now.

12
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,925
Rebecca, why don't you
approach this

13
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,994
from a scientific point
of view?

14
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,363
Make a simple
plot-point graph,

15
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,898
and chart
your basal temperature

16
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,433
at a fixed hour
each morning.

17
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,202
After a couple of months,
a pattern will emerge,

18
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:41,807
thereby making your peak
fertility days absolutely
predictable.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,842
Good idea.
Thanks, Lilith!

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,245
Whew, boy!
You guys went through all that?

21
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,815
No, we just got ripped one night
and tore one off.

22
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,521
Remember that,
sugar, huh?

00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,531
Eh?

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,565
Eh?

41
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,368
Hey, all right.

42
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,970
Listen to mine.

43
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,506
"Dear Miss Howe, I'm having
a great time on vacation.

44
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,575
"I miss everyone there,
but I miss you most of all.

45
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,610
Love, Woody."

46
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,978
What does yours say, Sam?

47
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,313
"Dear Sam, I'm having a great
time on vacation.

48
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,917
"I miss everyone there,
but I miss you most of all.

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,953
Love, Woody."

50
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,655
"I'm having

00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,490

52
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,193
Cliffie?

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,561
Well, "Dear Mr. Clavin,

54
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,329
"I'm having a great time
on vacation.

55
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,198
Love, Woody."

56
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,205
Hey, Frasier,
Lilith.

57
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,373
What'll you have?

58
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,874
A scotch, Sam.

59
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,243
And whatever my Neanderthal
husband will have.

60
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,845
You two fighting?

61
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,413
No, on the contrary,
Sam,

62
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,183
I insist that
she call me that.

63
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,320
Frasier's been captivated
by a new theory of masculinity

64
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,124
which suggests within each man
is a hidden primal beast,

65
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,794
softened by years
of civilization
and sensitivity.

66
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,130
<i>He saw it on Sally Jesse.</i>

67
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,901
Yes, and they got a really cool
name for this beast.

68
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,037
It's called
the "Inner Hairy Man."

69
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,009
Or in your case, dear,
"The Receding Hairy Man."

70
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,443
She thinks it's all
very childish.

71
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,845
No, I don't.

72
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,313
Oh, tell your
little friends

73
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,914
all about your
big field trip.

74
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,050
Primal journey, Lilith.

75
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,086
You see, I'm just gonna
get into my car and go.

76
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,121
Out on the open road.

77
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,956
I'm taking a week off.

78
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,358
I'm gonna get in touch
with my hidden beast.

79
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,193
Ah, good luck.

80
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,595
Thanks, Sam.

81
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,296
You know, actually I was gonna
invite you to join me.

82
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,431
You see, I get
a little nervous

83
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,733
when I drive at night.

84
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,070
Oh, yeah, it'd be nice, but, uh,
Woody's on vacation, you know.

85
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,406
CARLA:
Oh, well, that's
okay, Sammy.

86
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,074
I could get my nephew
Frankie to help out.

87
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,410
He's a good kid,
real sweet, Frankie.

88
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,779
Of course,
he's never been in a bar,

89
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,514
but he'll be okay.

90
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,782
Oh, I don't know about this.

91
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,450
You know, this is my livelihood,
my business.

92
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,918
I don't want
to just turn it over

93
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,186
to somebody because
they're family.

94
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,321
He'll work for minimum wage.

95
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,390
I'm in!
Great!

96
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,858
Great.

97
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,860
Hey, this is great.
So, uh, where are we gonna go?

98
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,429
Desert? Mountains?

99
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,531
Well, actually, Sam,
the location doesn't
really matter.

100
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,801
This is more of a
spiritual journey,

101
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,503
an heroic quest.

102
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,205
You know, you know, if we, uh,
drive to California,

103
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,440
we could go see Disneyland.

104
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,608
Ooh!
Yeah.

105
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,045
Perhaps you could find your
manhood on the giant teacups.

106
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,583
Yeah, a road trip
to Disneyland.

107
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,085
Sounds fun.

108
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,220
You want to join us, Norm?

109
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:50,956
Well (stammers)...

110
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,092
I'm sure you two gentlemen
have something to do.

111
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>Oh, no problemo.</i>

112
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,794
I got a couple of weeks vacation
coming up.

113
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,699
Really?
Oh, yeah, my supervisor
reminds me daily.

114
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,234
Well, Cliff, I, uh,

115
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,136
I don't know if my car is
big enough...

116
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,372
Oh, let's take my wagon.
What do you say, Norm? Huh?

117
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,173
The four of us tooling
down old mother road,

118
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,476
getting in touch with
the old hairy man-mobile, huh?

119
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,344
I don't know.
I don't think I could handle

120
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,413
sitting still
for six hours a day.

121
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,984
Well, yeah,
it'd be more like ten.

122
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,185
Oh, then I'm in.

123
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,988
SAM:
Boy, I'll never forget,

124
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,457
when I was 19,
Buck, my best friend--

125
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,593
he was a teammate of mine
in the minors--

126
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,462
he and I, uh, hitchhiked
all across Route 66.

127
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,797
Boy, best time
of my life.

128
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,298
Yeah?
Do they still have the place

129
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,000
where the Cadillacs are
sticking up out of the ground?

130
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,702
Oh, yeah, Cadillac Ranch,
in Merrimac Caverns.

131
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,970
All right.

132
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,304
Yeah, once I lost
a Hopalong Cassidy watch there

133
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,472
when I was ten.

134
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,074
Yeah, it just slipped
right off my wrist.

135
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,876
Yeah, you wouldn't believe it,

136
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,745
but as a youth,
I had very fine-boned wrists.

137
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,215
I can't tell you how many
people mistook me for royalty.

138
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,151
It's true.

139
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,587
Oh, what the hell!
We'll make it a group thing.

140
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,922
All of us will get out
and try to get in touch

141
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,791
with our tribal
instincts.
There you go.

142
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,260
Oh, give me strength.

143
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,162
Oh, come on, Lilith,
be happy for us.

144
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,830
We're all dropping
our inhibitions.

145
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,333
We're gonna go out and find
our manhood on the open road.

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,300
Yeah, like men!

147
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,868
Yeah, like manly men!
Real men!

148
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,670
<i>Like those chicks
in Thelma and Louise!</i>

149
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,972
(cheering)

150
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,475
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What happened here?

151
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,243
Ah, the eight track's acting up
again there, Sammy.

152
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,778
Grab the butter knife

153
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,280
out of the glove compartment,
will you?

154
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,917
Yeah.
There you go.

155
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,151
Here we are.

156
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,320
Well, at least we still got
the A.M. radio.

157
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,823
So, how far
have we gone?

158
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,958
Oh, about
a hundred miles.

159
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:33,959
Yeah.

160
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,994
Well, it's
minus 38.

161
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,296
Why minus 38?

162
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,965
Well, my trip meter
only sets back to 38.

163
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,338
Well, let's see.
What's a hundred minus 38?

164
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,674
Well, why don't we just,
uh, drive 38 more miles?

165
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,875
Then we'll know
we've hit a hundred.

166
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,412
Hey...

167
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,581
I didn't know
you were good at math.

168
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,816
Yeah, well, you know,
I used to be an accountant.

169
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,186
What you reading
there, Fras?

170
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,688
Oh, uh...

171
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,556
<i>It's called
Iron John.</i>

172
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,693
It's a best-seller
about getting in touch
with one's masculinity.

173
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,328
Mmm.

174
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,331
So you're actually gonna try
to read in a moving car?

175
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,799
Doesn't that make you sick?

176
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,601
No.

177
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,003
I always get sick
when I read in a car.

178
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,472
The car bounces around,

179
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,809
you know, your eyes try
to follow the words there.

180
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,411
You can smell
the gas fumes.

181
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,247
Pretty soon, you start sweating
and gasping for breath.

182
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,748
What's the problem?

183
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,483
I'm sick.

184
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,887
You know, I'll bet it's
from reading in the car.

185
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,189
I'm telling you.

186
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,137
(inhales)
(moans)

187
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,208
What?

188
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,344
I didn't say anything.

189
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,945
Yeah, but you were
thinking something.

190
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,280
No, I wasn't.

191
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,582
Yes, you think I have the
hots for Carla's nephew.

192
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,783
I didn't say that.

193
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,851
'Cause I do.

194
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,920
No kidding?

195
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,288
Oh, like you don't?

196
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,556
You've only been
sitting there

197
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,291
for the last four
days staring at him.

198
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,226
And it's worse with you,
because you're married.

199
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,061
That's slutty.

200
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,831
And what about you?

201
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,466
You're ogling him
and meanwhile,

202
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,335
you're trying to conceive
a child with another man.

203
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,838
Yes, but he is not my
husband, so that does
not make me a slut.

204
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,143
It's perfectly natural.

205
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,444
One can be married

206
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,747
and still be drawn
to the odd magnificent butt.

207
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,615
For once I'm with you, Doc.

208
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,452
I agree, but you know
what I really notice in a guy?

209
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,388
His eyes.

210
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,758
Yeah, but that magnificent
butt thing is right up there.

211
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,726
Yeah, well,
this guy has both.

212
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,328
And talk about biceps.

213
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,296
Whoa. You're
getting me hot.

214
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,498
Who are we talking
about here?

215
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,733
Your nephew, Frankie.

216
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,107
That is so sick!

217
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,610
Carla, surely,
as a woman, you can see

218
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,380
how your nephew might be
considered... desirable.

219
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,215
Sure. You start
thinking like that,

220
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,351
and you end up
with Woody's family.

221
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,991
Just look at you two.

222
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,293
You're acting like a couple
of construction workers.

223
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,763
Carla's right,
Lilith.

224
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,498
I mean, we're treating
men just the way

225
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,467
we hate to be
treated by them.

226
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,472
Oops, I dropped my purse.

227
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
I'll get it for you.

228
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,078
Here you go.

229
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,212
Thank you.
You're welcome.

230
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,589
Thank you again.
You're welcome.

231
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,071
Okay, I got one.

232
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,906
When was the last time
you guys cried?

233
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,075
Huh? Cliffie?

234
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,610
Uh... well, I guess the, uh,

235
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,680
it's probably my,
uh, junior prom.

236
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,149
Oh, no, no, no. Cliffie,
this is not that story where,

237
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,318
uh, you got stood up
and you had to take your ma

238
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,186
and everyone laughed at you
and pantsed you, is it?

239
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:25,524
<i>No, no, I said junior prom.</i>

240
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,264
Yeah, you see, Ma was
putting on a boutonniere,

241
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,234
and a pin stuck me in the chest,
I got a staph infection.

242
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,036
Hmm.

243
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,470
How about you, Fras?

244
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,939
Well, the day we left
for this trip,

245
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,709
my son gave me a,
a picture.

246
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,144
And you cried?

247
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,646
I cried because
it was so beautiful.

248
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,652
Good luck finding
that hairy man.

249
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>Well, at least I can
get pricked by a pin
and not almost die.</i>

250
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,328
What about you, Norm?

251
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,998
Well, there was
one time, uh,

252
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,935
we thought Vera was
pregnant, and...

253
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,504
then it turns out she wasn't.

254
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm sorry, Norm.

255
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,276
You never told me
that, buddy.

256
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,211
Well, it turns out,
she was lying.

257
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,348
She didn't tell me
till after the wedding.

258
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,052
I must have cried for a week.

259
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
How about you, Sam?

260
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,358
Oh, you guys
should see him.

261
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,593
(cooing):
He's sleeping
like a little baby.

262
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,928
Aw, it's so cute.

263
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,497
(tires screeching)
(yelling)

264
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,043
What seems to be
the trouble, Sam?

265
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,113
Well, I know a little bit
about engines, and...

266
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,081
it seems like what
we got here is

267
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,050
a burned piece of meat.

268
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,822
Yeah, how is my, uh,
hobo steak coming?

269
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,658
Oh, yeah, well, I
threw that on the engine

270
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,427
back in, uh, Lukachukai.

271
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,663
At the risk of hearing
your answer, Cliff,

272
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,133
why would you do
something so stupid?

273
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,734
Oh, well, you,
you cook in there.

274
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,603
You see, you put your
food on the engine,

275
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,872
and then you can drive
and cook at the same time.

276
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,342
Oh, hey, it looks like the
vegetable kabobs are about done.

277
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,517
Maybe they're a little
bit too crisp, huh?

278
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,920
SAM:
Come on, let's
get back in the car

279
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,689
and go find a motel, huh?
Yeah, all right.

280
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,724
Hey, Cliffie, I can't
turn the key here.

281
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,560
Well, yeah, it's got a security
device on it there, Sam.

282
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,529
Oh.
Yeah, what I do
is turn the wheel

283
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,497
all the way to the left
and then, uh,

284
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,199
crank the key
as hard as I can.

285
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,434
(keys jangle)

286
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,069
SAM:
Oh, man.

287
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,504
Look at that. I just broke
the key off in the ignition.

288
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,376
<i>I said "as hard
as I can," Sammy.</i>

289
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,447
That's just great.

290
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,148
What are we going to do now?

291
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,417
Looks like I'm going to have
to hot-wire the car here.

292
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,052
Hey, wh-what am
I thinking about?

293
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,220
I've had my cellular phone

294
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,488
the whole time;
we can just call

295
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,191
for help.
No, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

296
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,826
Frasier, where's
your hairy man?

297
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,661
We can save ourselves here.

298
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,964
Yeah, hot-wiring's easy.

299
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,232
Buck showed me
how to do it

300
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,434
on a trip
across the states.

301
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,670
God, that guy was a whiz
with anything mechanical.

302
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,704
Yeah, here you go.

303
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,006
All you got to do is take

304
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,841
these two wires here
and connect them.

305
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,809
(electricity crackling)

306
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,884
You, you okay there, Sammy?

307
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,486
Diane?

308
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,827
Yeah, well, uh, you know
what your friend Buck, uh,

309
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,562
didn't, uh, reckon
on there, Sammy,

310
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,699
was that Cliff Clavin
anti-theft device.

311
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,534
Yeah, you see
old Mr. Car Thief

312
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,669
gets the shock of his life,

313
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,039
the doors automatically
lock shut,

314
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,373
and the alarm goes off.

315
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,108
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

316
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,344
<i>The doors lock
automatically?</i>

317
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,212
Yeah, but the alarm's
supposed to be going off.

318
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,414
You know, it must
be on the fritz.

319
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,315
Our ears should
be ringing by now.

320
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,317
Oh, I'll just have
to do it manually.

321
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,354
You locked us out of the car!

322
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,291
(cell phone ringing)

323
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,827
My phone!

324
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,128
My phone is ringing!

325
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,329
All right!

326
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,665
And the doors are locked!

327
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,900
Well, break the damn window!

328
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,101
Are you kidding me?!

329
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,369
You know how much
those windows cost?

330
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,904
We don't have time
to argue here, Cliff.

331
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,405
You're not breaking
those windows.

332
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,873
(ringing continues)
You just try it, young man.

333
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,542
You're gonna have
to come through me...
(glass breaking)

334
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,012
You're gonna pay for that,
I hope you know.

335
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
(ringing continues)

336
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,749
Hello? Hello?

337
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,384
If it's Vera,
I'm not here.

338
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,855
Yes, this is Frasier Crane.

339
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,523
Oh, thank God
somebody called.

340
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,058
The batteries are
getting sort of low.

341
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,727
Look, I don't
have much time.

342
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,195
Excuse me?

343
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,030
Y-Yes, I understand
the Democratic party's

344
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,331
in trouble, and I'd
love to contribute,

345
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,400
but I'm in a little
trouble myself right now.

346
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,802
Oh, damn!

347
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,970
The batteries are dead!

348
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,739
SAM:
All right. Okay.

349
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,140
Let's, uh,
take it easy, Fras.

350
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,042
Nobody panic.
We'll be all right.

351
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,877
FRASIER:
Great.

352
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,246
We're lost, can't
start the car.

353
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,148
Way to go, Sam.

354
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,383
SAM:
Oh, now wait a minute.

355
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,517
Don't blame me, you know.

356
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,885
It's Cliff's fault for wanting

357
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,888
to see America
like the pioneers.

358
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,990
We should've stayed
on the main road.

359
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,459
Did Charles Kuralt
stay on the main road?

360
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,794
Look, I'm not the one

361
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
that fell asleep at the wheel.

362
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:31,730
I wouldn't have fallen
asleep at the wheel

363
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,065
if you hadn't given me
that extra shift.

364
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,567
Well, we were behind schedule.

365
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,969
Yes, I believe that
was your fault

366
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,438
for getting your fat butt lodged
in that cavern.

367
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:42,875
Well, I was looking
for my Hopalong Cassidy watch.

368
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,410
Do you mind?!

369
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,978
SAM:
Ah, come on, you guys.

370
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,147
Can we stop arguing
for, like, ten seconds here?

371
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,448
Geez, Buck and I went across

372
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,650
the entire United States
and we didn't argue once.

373
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,519
You know, frankly, Sam,
I'm getting a little tired

374
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,088
of hearing about Saint Buck!

375
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,757
If he was so wonderful,

376
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,159
how come none of us
has ever met him?

377
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,261
Because ever since he got
into the Hall of Fame,

378
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,530
he won't return my phone calls,
so I have to hang around

379
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,765
a bunch of losers
in a stupid bar!

380
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,201
Does that answer your
question, Mr. Hairy Man?!

381
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,474
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

382
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,142
I didn't mean
anything by that.

383
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,479
It's just that, well,
he asked the question.

384
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:28,587
You know, I, I hate
to bring this up, but, uh...

385
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,623
we could really be in some,
some serious trouble here.

386
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,858
Oh, come on, man.

387
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,693
Hey, listen,
at least we, uh,

388
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,328
we've got each other
here, right?

389
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,429
I mean, you know,
here we are

390
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,531
out in the desert,
back to nature.

391
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,000
I mean, look, look
at this air here.

392
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,301
It's clear. It's fresh.

393
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,969
I mean, isn't that
why we came out here

394
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,471
in the first place?
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,306
Look at the stars, guys.

396
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,507
Look at that.

397
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,309
Got to be a million
of 'em up there.

398
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,644
Kind of makes you feel
insignificant, huh?

399
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,981
Yeah, I don't
feel anything.

400
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,556
(sighs)

401
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,226
Frankie?
Yeah?

402
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,794
I need you to move
those big boxes

403
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,995
to the other side
of the poolroom.

404
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,731
Gosh, Miss Howe,
it's the fifth time today.

405
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,167
I'm getting kind of sweaty.

406
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,169
Well, then take off
your shirt, you goose.

407
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,274
I could have gone
with those guys

408
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,709
on that little road trip,
you know.

409
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,110
I know.

410
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,379
I just wasn't here
when they decided to go.

411
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,747
So you've said.

412
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,983
They, uh, probably
tried to call me

413
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,885
and hung up on my machine.
Hmm.

414
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,554
Sometimes it doesn't
record the hang-ups.

415
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,556
Mm-hmm.

416
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,026
You're not much
of a conversationalist, are you?

417
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,565
Where is everybody?

418
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,833
Probably in
New Mexico by now.

419
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,834
You know, I could've
gone with 'em

420
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,936
if they'd just left a message.

421
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,605
No, I-I was talking
about my nephew

422
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,342
and Rebecca
of Horny Brook Farm.

423
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,447
They're in the back.

424
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,315
Frankie's helping
her move some boxes.

425
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,917
I'll just bet he is.

426
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,452
You know, I'm getting
a little sick of the way

427
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,287
she's throwing herself
all over that guy.

428
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,855
I mean, it's disgusting.

429
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,957
Carla, I've never
seen this side of you.

430
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,092
Yeah, well...

431
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,626
You know, Frankie's sweet.

432
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,096
One day he's going to meet
a nice girl and settle down.

433
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,864
And in the meantime,
it's my job

434
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,699
to keep him
away from sleazy women

435
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,401
looking for a quick one-nighter.

436
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,269
You mean women like you?

437
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,039
Ironic, huh?

438
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,810
Oh, Frankie.
What?

439
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,446
I thought I told you
to stay away from Rebecca.

440
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,348
Look, the woman is a tramp.

441
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,183
All she wants you for
is your body.

442
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,419
Miss Howe? She seems so nice.

443
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,620
(chuckling):
Are you kidding?

444
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,156
She has had every man
in this bar.

445
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,391
Every single one.

446
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,326
What?
That's right. Most of 'em,

447
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,961
ten, 20 times.

448
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,730
Look, you're a good boy,
Frankie. Now, go, go.

449
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,265
Get out of here,
before it's too late.

450
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,634
Now, go.
Run like the wind!

451
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,136
Go! Don't ever
come back!

452
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,604
I won't.

453
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,140
You know what I'm going to do
on the way home?
What?

454
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,908
I'm going to stop
at Saint Michael's,

455
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,344
and I'm going to pray
for her soul.

456
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,948
You do that.

457
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,451
How the hell did
he ever get in my family?

458
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,221
PAUL:
Hey, Rebecca?

459
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,457
Yes?
Rumor has it

460
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,592
you've, uh, slept
with every guy in the bar.

461
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,927
What?

462
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:23,829
So, uh, how come
you haven't

463
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,898
done the wild thing
with old Paul, huh?

464
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,304
I never get included
in anything.

465
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,209
CLIFF:
We're going to die out here.

466
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,311
They're going to find
our bleached bones.

467
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,480
Look, let's just
relax here, everybody.

468
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,716
Everything's going
to seem better in the morning.

469
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,317
Oh, yes, Sam.

470
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,652
"In the morning."

471
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,854
When the desert
sun comes up.

472
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,890
By noon, it'll be 120!

473
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,292
Forget it, Doc.

474
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,828
You're never going to see 120.

475
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,664
At 110, your lungs explode.

476
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,836
Cliff, that is ridiculous!

477
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,471
Oh, yeah?

478
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,172
Well, would you like
to make a friendly wager

479
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,575
on that?

480
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,378
How many hours have
we got till sunup?

481
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,280
About four, I'd say.

482
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,422
Well... I've lived
a good life.

483
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,425
The only thing I

484
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,427
regret is I didn't get
a chance to say

485
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,029
good-bye to Lilith
and Frederick,

486
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,998
to tell them how
much I love them.

487
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,167
Well, at least you've got
somebody

488
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,802
to carry on your name, you know.

489
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,404
I-I don't have anybody.

490
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,939
If I die out here,
it's me dying alone.

491
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,776
No, you're not, Sam.
You've got us.

492
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:51,717
Ah... here we are wasting
away in the desert.

493
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,119
I never pictured
that the four of us

494
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,320
would go out like this.

495
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,156
How did you picture it, Cliff?

496
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,660
Well, I pictured, uh,

497
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,962
Sammy getting topped
by a jealous husband.

498
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,299
Norm, I figured you'd,
you know, heart attack.

499
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,604
Frasier here...

500
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,239
Cliff, I, I don't
want to hear it.

501
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,709
You bet you don't.

502
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,018
Oh, look at that.

503
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,653
The sun's about
to come up.

504
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,588
FRASIER:
Say, uh,

505
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,390
where's, where's Norm?
Oh, he's asleep

506
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,491
in the back here.

507
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,926
Yeah? Well...

508
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,427
well, he's not asleep anymore.

509
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,062
Oh, hey, he's gone!

510
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,266
Well, he's got to be
around here someplace.

511
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,601
Norm!
Norm!

512
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,003
Normie!
Norm!

513
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,004
Normie!
Norm!

514
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,006
Here, Norm!

515
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,408
You, you don't suppose some wolf

516
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,043
dragged him off
in the night, do you?

517
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,546
Well, maybe we ought
to take a look for him.

518
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:55,948
FRASIER:
Not me.

519
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:59,084
I don't want to meet the wolf
that can drag off Norm.

520
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,822
(horn toots)

521
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,691
Norm!
Norm!

522
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,959
Thank God you're safe!

523
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,361
Yeah.
Where'd you
get this thing?

524
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,196
It came complimentary
with the room.

525
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,364
What room?

526
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,432
At the resort.

527
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:14,867
What resort?

528
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,403
The resort just over the hill,
where I spent the night.

529
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,104
You mean you
stayed in a resort

530
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,839
while we slept here
in the dirt?!

531
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,107
Why didn't you come
and tell us?

532
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,276
How could you do
something like this?!

533
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,678
You guys want to yell
at me some more,

534
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,379
or do you want to make
the breakfast buffet?

535
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,681
It stops in ten minutes.

536
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,249
Well, naturally,
the buffet.
