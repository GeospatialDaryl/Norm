00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:04,018
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,621
TV REPORTER: We're going live
now to the Route 93 overpass,

3
00:00:06,622 --> 00:00:09,591
where an unidentified woman
has climbed to the outside rail

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,912
and is threatening to jump.

5
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,294
An emergency rescue team
has had no luck so far

6
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:14,495
in persuading the woman

7
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,487
to climb down
from her dangerous perch.

8
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:18,166
Oh, boy. As one
who has been there,

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:21,236
it is imperative that
they do nothing to agitate that woman.

10
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:22,570
Boy, oh, boy. I mean, what

11
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,305
what has
to go wrong with your life

12
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:26,641
to be driven to such
desperate measures, huh?

13
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:28,309
We have a tentative
identification.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,045
The woman is
Anna Cosetti of Boston.

15
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,913
Sam, can I
take the afternoon off?

16
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:34,165
Why?
I gotta go

17
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,703
look after the kids;
That woman's my babysitter.

18
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:41,523

What's that, Cliff?

27
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:28,853
They're closing
the Twi-Lite Drive-In.

28
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:29,971
Oh, you're joking, man.

29
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:31,022
No, not at all.

30
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,373
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:35,093
Another American icon
destroyed by the bulldozer.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,928
What are they gonna close next?

33
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,229
Hopefully, your mouth.

34
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:41,583
Well, I like
drive-ins.

35
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,852
All the great memories
I have of that place.

36
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,052
You know what

37
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:46,137
I love most about that place?

38
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:49,207
It has that,
that great hot, fresh popcorn,

39
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,625
and they use real butter there,

40
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:51,993
not that imitation
yellow stuff.

41
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,861
Isn't that where you proposed
to Vera there, Norm?

42
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,029
Yeah.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,314
Anyway, do you know any place

44
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,450
that has real butter
these days? I don't.

45
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,985
Boy, I've been going
to that place

46
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,386
ever since I was a teenager.

47
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,521
Of course a lot of
the stuff I saw there

48
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,156
was pretty hard core.

49
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:06,941
They didn't show those
kind of movies there.

50
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,910
Who said they did?

51
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,422
Boy, oh, boy, you know,
I'll never forget

52
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,216
Ma used to take me down there

53
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:15,983
all bundled up in my pyjamas

54
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,185
and all, you know.

55
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:19,554
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
it was at the Twi-Lite

56
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:22,857
that I first saw
Herbie, the Love Bug.

57
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:26,744
Cliffie, Herbie, the Love
Bug came out in, uh, 1969,

58
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,513
and you were born in, uh...

59
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,630
Oh, please, man, don't.
Don't do the math.

60
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:35,320
Geez, I feel so left out.

61
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,155
You guys have all
these wonderful memories

62
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,423
about this spot.

63
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,758
I must confess, I've never
even been to a drive-in.

64
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,027
CLIFF:
Well, tonight's your lucky night, Doc.

65
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:45,897
Uh, it says here, down
at the Twi-Lite they're, uh,

66
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,416
closing up with an
all-night Godzilla marathon.

67
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,618
What do you say,
shall we go? Shall we, huh?

68
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:51,919
NORM:
Yeah, I'm in.

69
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:53,838
Geez, I'd love to.
Sounds like fun.

70
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,173
Why don't we all just jump
into my BMW? SAM:

71
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:59,127
You can't go to a,
a drive-in in a Beemer, man.

72
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,196
You need a classic convertible.

73
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:02,363
Okay, okay.

74
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,399
I'm sold. So where
do we get one?

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,667
Well, Cliff, your mom has
a convertible, doesn't she?

76
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:08,753
No!

77
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,872
What do you mean?
I saw her just the other day.

78
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,039
She was driving a convertible.

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,241
Now, look, Norm,
there's a lot of

80
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:15,709
beautiful women driving around
in convertibles, all right?

81
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,778
Mr. Clavin, you
wouldn't be afraid

82
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,947
to ask your mom to borrow
the car, would you?

83
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,165
I'm not gonna dignify
that with a yes.

84
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:24,819
Come on, Cliff.
It's one night.

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,054
It's not gonna kill ya.
Yeah.

86
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,655
Come on.
Oh, well.

87
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:28,957
All right, all
right, all right.

88
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,958
I'll figure something out.

89
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,559
All right, count me in.

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,227
All right, great.
What about you, Mr. Peterson?

91
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,795
Well, I'm in, Wood, but, uh,

92
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:36,397
I can't go to the
snack bar for you guys.

93
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:37,749
When I was a teenager, I, uh,

94
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,383
ran up quite a
tab at that place.

95
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,552
Well, how big?

96
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,790
Well, they are closing
down, aren't they?

97
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,595
Sam Malone!

98
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,380
Yes.

99
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,048
You know who I am?

100
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:55,567
No, sir, I don't,

101
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,903
but I swear to you, I never
touched your daughter.

102
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:04,725
Nah, nah, you bought this
bar from me 17 years ago.

103
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,260
Although, now that
you mention it,

104
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,395
you did touch my daughter.

105
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:09,864
I'll be damned! Yeah!

106
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:11,866
Gus O'Malley!
How are you doing?

107
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,067
Look at that.

108
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:14,268
What are you doing here?

109
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,839
Ah, I came to town
for a wedding

110
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:17,205
and thought I'd drop by

111
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,856
Boy, this place looks great.

112
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:20,592
You've really, really
kept it in good shape.

113
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,293
Yeah, thanks for that.

114
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,871
Hey, uh, I want you
to meet, uh...

115
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,263
Carla Tortelli's our waitress.

116
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,397
This is Gus O'Malley.
Hi.

117
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:27,598
That's Woody, our bartender.

118
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,649
Hi.
Woody.

119
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,553
I bought this place from Gus.

120
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,221
Yeah.
Sam, you've been had.

121
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,290
You already own this bar.

122
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,461
You must be Coach's boy.

123
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:46,434
It's a good guess,
but, no, he, uh,

124
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:47,768
actually, you know, uh,

125
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:49,504
Coach passed away
several years ago.

126
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,573
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah.

127
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,576
You look great. What've,
what've you been doing?

128
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,578
I moved to Arizona
with the wife.

129
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,213
Been living off
my life savings.

130
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,715
Believe me, if you
manage this place right,

131
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:03,012
it can really provide
for you in your old age.

132
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,353
It can?

133
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,372
Oh, yeah. It's all
in the management.

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Oh...

135
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,241
Sam, I'm gonna use
the petty cash

136
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,475
to buy lottery tickets.

137
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,946
The way I figure it,
it's our only hope.

138
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,215
Rebecca, I'd like you
to meet Gus O'Malley.

139
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,717
He used to have
the place before me.

140
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,102
Oh, nice to meet you.
Rebecca.

141
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,388
Hey, Sam, uh...

142
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:26,491
you and her, huh?
Oh, we, uh...

143
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:29,527
No, no. No, no,
no. No, no.

144
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:31,195
It feels so great

145
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,131
to be back here
in this old saloon!

146
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,232
Boy, I could...
Listen, do you think I could,

147
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,800
I could pop back here, you know,

148
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,169
and maybe serve up
one little drink?

149
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,703
You know, just
for old times' sake?

150
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:40,921
Yeah. Do it. Go on.

151
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,540
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

152
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,808
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,076
This brings it all back.

154
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,178
It's like I never left.

155
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,813
Uh, could I have
a beer, please, Gus?

156
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:50,948
Sure, Norm.

157
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:01,409
Something's different.

158
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,177
Gus is back!

159
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,696
How you been, Norm?

160
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,397
I'm all right.
Can't complain.

161
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,233
Yeah. How is
that lovely bride of yours?

162
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,734
What, what was her name again?

163
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:11,152
Vera.
Oh, yeah.

164
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,671
Vera. Boy, I remember
when they were newly-wed.

165
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:15,122
You'd come in here every night

166
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,124
and make those goo-goo eyes
at each other.

167
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,192
You're kidding me.

168
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,260
Norm and Vera?

169
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,895
GUS:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

170
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,893
He'd recite poetry
to her all the time.

171
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,733
He'd put quarter after
quarter in that jukebox,

172
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,802
and he'd slow dance
with Vera until closing.

173
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:28,870
You remember that, Norm?

174
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,621
Just give me the beer, Gus.

175
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,479
Hey, guys!

176
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,297
Hey!
Hey, Johnny. Hi, Ed.

177
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:41,582
Sorry I'm late.

178
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,751
Got the car.
Everything's all set.

179
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,052
Great. How'd you
get your mother

180
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:46,287
to part with her
precious vehicle?

181
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:48,556
Oh, I just, uh, poured a
couple of glasses of wine,

182
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:49,790
cranked the heat up to full,

183
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,293
and, uh, she'll
sleep till Saturday.

184
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:54,929
All right. Godzilla,
here we come. SAM:

185
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,430
Hey, you guys have a good time.

186
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,431
See you later, Woody.

187
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:58,666
Listen, I want to
thank you guys

188
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,701
for letting me come along.

189
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,135
Horseplay, you know.
Camaraderie.

190
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:02,770
Hanging out with the
guys and having fun

191
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:04,638
is something that's been
sorely missed in my life.

192
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,273
I'm really looking forward
to this drive-in thing.

193
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:07,474
Yeah, well, in that case,

194
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:08,876
I suggest we make
you trunk boy.

195
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:10,511
Wow, trunk boy!

196
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,980
Don't know what it is,
but it sounds fun.

197
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:16,183
Well, gang, I
got to be leaving.

198
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,853
I haven't had so much
fun in a long, long time.

199
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,254
I feel like a kid again.

200
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,589
Hey, hold on a second here.

201
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,590
Gus, listen.

202
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:23,925
You know, with Woody leaving

203
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,292
to go to the drive-in
and everything,

204
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,460
I'm a little
short-handed.

205
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,062
What do you say you hop
behind the bar here

206
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,964
and let me put you
on salary for a night?

207
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,499
Nah, you kids don't want
an old buzzard back there.

208
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,601
Yeah, of course.
Come on.

209
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:34,902
It'd be so great.
You know,

210
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,604
it'd be like having
a little piece of history

211
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:37,772
behind the bar, you know?

212
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,574
Take us back to our roots.

213
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,408
Besides, we really
like you, Gus.

214
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,544
Well, all right,
all right. I'll do it.

215
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:44,612
Hey, Sammy?
Yeah.

216
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:45,813
As long as we
got the old geezer,

217
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:47,548
I'm gonna take the night off.

218
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,968
W-What do you want
me to do first, boss?

219
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,471
Well, you tell me.
You're the boss.

220
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,271
What?

221
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,623
Yeah, you're gonna

222
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,391
run the place,
just like the old days, Gus.

223
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,826
As a matter of fact...
(rings bell)

224
00:07:58,827 --> 00:07:59,827
Hey, listen up, everybody!

225
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:01,128
This is Gus O'Malley.

226
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:04,086
He owned the place before me,
and as far as I'm concerned,

227
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,566
tonight I'm working for him.

228
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:08,319
(whoops and applause)

229
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,488
Do you mean that, Sam?

230
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:12,490
Yeah.

231
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,225
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I'm very touched.

232
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,292
Yeah.
Thank you.

233
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,694
Yeah.
Boy, it's, uh,

234
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,163
been a long time;
I'm a little bit rusty.

235
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:24,235
Long time since I
ran a bar, but here goes.

236
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,504
All right! All right!
Let's move it!

237
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,639
Let's move it!
Let's move it, sexy.

238
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:29,974
And you, too.

239
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,341
Let's move it! Move it!

240
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:33,961
I wanna see your butt
moving, not your lips.

241
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:37,047
Oh, yeah, that feels right.

242
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,609
Great.

243
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,776
Finally we park.

244
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:52,246
You only drove around
the lot three times.

245
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,015
I had to get my
bearings there, Norm.

246
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,216
Oh, yeah, I used to come

247
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:56,950
with my high school
buddies all the time

248
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:59,001
and I'd go to the
snack bar and come back...

249
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,388
couldn't find the car.

250
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:01,505
Damnedest thing.

251
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,724
Kept happening
over and over again.

252
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:07,027
Cliff, did it ever occur to you
that maybe the fellows were...?

253
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,316
Never mind.

254
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,218
Let's hook up the speaker.
All right.

255
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,887
No, no, hold your
horses there, Woody.

256
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,289
You know, those things can
chip and scratch. Uh...

257
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:21,659
See if I can get
the old speaker doily here.

258
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,711
Yeah.

259
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:25,313
You know, my mom
made this herself.

260
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,414
(thumping)

261
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,516
FRASIER:
Hey, are we there yet?

262
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:29,717
Uh-oh. Trunk boy.

263
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,853
Yeah.

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,722
Oh, hang on, Doc, we're coming!

265
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,057
FRASIER:
Well, hurry up!

266
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,060
Ah, no!
What?

267
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,418
Ah, the stupid key
broke off in the lock there.

268
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,248
FRASIER:
Hey, what's going on out there?

269
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:45,716
Don't panic, okay?

270
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,953
Th-The first rule of being
trunk boy is, "Don't panic."

271
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,538
Now, I have some news for you

272
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:52,073
that you may find upsetting.

273
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,075
Cliff broke the key
off in the lock.

274
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:55,776
FRASIER:
What?!

275
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:56,944
(banging) Hey, hey, hey, hey!

276
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,545
Don't be putting dents
in that lid, huh?

277
00:09:58,546 --> 00:09:59,847
(banging)

278
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,549
Oh, thank God! Air!

279
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,784
Oh, great, great.
Thanks a lot, Doc.

280
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:07,121
In your cowardly desire to
live, you broke Ma's trunk.

281
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,989
That's fine.
Let's watch the movie.

282
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,824
Come on, guys.
The movie's about to start.

283
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:11,959
I don't mind telling you,

284
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,627
That-that's the most
terrifying thing

285
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:15,062
I've ever gone
through in my life.

286
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:16,497
Yeah, well, we saved six bucks.

287
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:17,898
Oh? That much?
Yeah.

288
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:22,770
Wood, you want to make the, uh,

289
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,605
first, uh, run
to the snack bar, please?

290
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:25,996
Sure. What do
you guys want?

291
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,576
Well, I'll have a mineral water

292
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:31,345
and a decaf cap, and, um...

293
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,847
Oh! Bring me some
Toblerone chocolate.

294
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:37,001
You really don't get the
drive-in experience, do you?

295
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,152
I'm trying.

296
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:39,854
Hey, uh, listen,
if we're talking

297
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,323
about having messy snacks in
the car, I guess it's apropos

298
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,158
to go over Ma's rules

299
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,460
as regards the food
and beverage service.

300
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,496
Uh, Norm, you want to get
the, uh, flyers

301
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,464
out of the glove
compartment there, please?

302
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:51,632
Cliff, uh, listen...

303
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,334
Tell you what?
While I pass out these,

304
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:54,869
uh, flyers, why
don't you go ahead

305
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,070
and get the, uh, snacks, okay?

306
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,237
We'll save time that way.

307
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:58,928
Oh, capital idea.
Very efficient.

308
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,457
Be back in a flash.
Okay.

309
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,147
Ma's rule number one-
ditch the mail-man.

310
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:08,900
(engine starting)

311
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,891
Shake your booty, Tortelli!

312
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,525
You got scotches waiting.

313
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:20,561
My policy is that
if the customer

314
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,013
doesn't get the drink
within 30 seconds,

315
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,498
they're on the house,

316
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,266
which means you're docked
for the price of the beverage.

317
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,301
I'll dock you.

318
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,435
I heard that.

319
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,172
You know, between you and me,

320
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,307
I think she needed that
little kick in the butt.

321
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,509
She's always just doing
exactly what she wants to do,

322
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,977
and she never
gets any work done.

323
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,746
Well, it must be nice
to have the kind of job

324
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:42,949
where you just stand around
all day and talk all the time.

325
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,685
Excuse me?

326
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:47,738
Am I to assume that the time
cards have been finished?

327
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,122
That you've completed

328
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,891
the work schedule
for next week?

329
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,327
That you made out the
deposit slips for this money

330
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,329
that is overflowing
the cash drawer here?

331
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,664
While you're standing around,
I've been hustling drinks!

332
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,033
Well, I have been very busy.

333
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,335
Well, maybe you've been
flapping your lips there! Hey!

334
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:02,736
(bell rings)

335
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,037
Tortelli!

336
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:06,407
You got boilermakers
here, Tortelli!

337
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,546
Oh, Sam, can I talk
to you for a minute?

338
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,147
Sure. Sure.

339
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,351
Well, suddenly we're in Hawaii
lounging on the beach.

340
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,638
Could, could you just
give us a second here, Gus?

341
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,506
Right. That's exactly
what you got.

342
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,158
Sam, cute is cute,

343
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,861
but you got to do something
about Captain Bligh over there.

344
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,163
All right, yeah,
I'll talk to him.

345
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,264
I'll talk to him.

346
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,399
Hey, Gus, I have an idea.

347
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,584
Let me give you a break here.

348
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:37,155
You've been working
your buns off here.

349
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,689
Oh, I get it.

350
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,457
The old man's in the way, huh?

351
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,961
Well, I guess you can't
go home again after all.

352
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,763
For a few precious hours there,

353
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,133
I was able to forget
about my heart condition.

354
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,752
Gus, you have a...

355
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:53,153
you have a heart condition?

356
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:54,772
Well, I didn't want
to bring it up,

357
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,463
but I mean, uh,
who cares, right?

358
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,658
Yeah.

359
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,593
No, no.

360
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:00,928
Oh, shoot!

361
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,731
You know, uh, completely forgot,
I got something to do here.

362
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,149
Uh, oh, damn.

363
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,684
Can you, can you,
uh, fill in for me

364
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,685
for the rest of the night?

365
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,852
You wouldn't mind, would you?

366
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,003
You mean that, Sam?

367
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:11,305
Yeah, please.

368
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,140
Sam, you made me a happy man!

369
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:14,158
Ah, great.

370
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,243
All right!
All right!

371
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,045
Who went over my head?!

372
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,414
Who double-crossed Gus?!

373
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,038
Well, suddenly our tongues
ain't wagging no more, are they?

374
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,839
That's very interesting.

375
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,365
So, this is your
precious drive-in?

376
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,834
(chuckles)

377
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,936
Tin box squawking in our ears,

378
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,805
endless parade of people
walking in front of the car,

379
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:46,891
a man in a rubber dragon suit

380
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,560
stepping on miniature
Japanese houses.

381
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:52,563
Yeah, you believe they're
gonna tear this place down?

382
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,765
You guys, this couldn't
really happen, could it?

383
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,133
Hmm?

384
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,468
I mean, don't think I'm stupid
or anything, but I mean,

385
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,154
you know, if there really was
atomic testing offshore,

386
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:03,023
and it woke up a dinosaur,

387
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,193
and it got affected by
the radiation, I mean,

388
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,195
you know, not
exactly like this,

389
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:10,931
but maybe something
pretty close?

390
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,499
NORM:
Woody, Woody, Woody,

391
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,201
when are you gonna grow up?

392
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,602
(chuckles)

393
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,637
Course it could happen.

394
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:19,023
You know, I'm getting
kind of cold.

395
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,758
Do you think we can
put the top up?

396
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,543
Uh, sure, Fras.

397
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,517
(mechanical grinding)

398
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:32,953
What happened?

399
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:34,388
I don't know. It's stuck.

400
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,823
Well, put it
back down. Here.

401
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,034
I'm trying.
It's jammed.

402
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:40,695
(car horn honking)

403
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:42,463
MAN:
Hey, put that thing down!

404
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,864
We're trying to watch a movie!

405
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:45,265
Let me handle
this, Norm. (car horn honking)

406
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:49,102
I'm a great believer in
the retort courteous.

407
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,220
Why don't you move
your car, butt head?!

408
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,510
Yep.
Good work, Dr. Crane.

409
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,878
They stopped honking.

410
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:01,315
Many an upperclassman was
afraid of the lash of my tongue.

411
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:02,883
Well, you know, Norm,
I think you were

412
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:05,519
way out of line
with that "butt head" crack.

413
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:07,054
Oh, hi.
How you doing there?

414
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:09,139
NORM:
Look, uh,

415
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
it's-it's jammed.

416
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:11,742
It-it won't go down. It, uh...

417
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,533
Thank you!

418
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,804
CLIFF:
Oh, well, there you guys are.

419
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,406
Boy, I get so turned
around in these drive-ins.

420
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:28,208
(chuckles)

421
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,326
Hey.

422
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,579
Hey, what-what
happened to the top?!

423
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,913
All right, come on, you guys.

424
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,481
I'm taking names.

425
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:36,899
Well, geez, Cliff,
it-it was the guy behind us.

426
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,351
He just went over
to the snack bar.

427
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:39,587
You can't miss him.

428
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,822
He's got the sort of
fashion risk hair style.

429
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,023
Oh.

430
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:44,825
A little punky
freak, huh? Yeah.

431
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:45,926
I'll-I'll deal
with him.

432
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,828
Okay.

433
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:52,307
Now, what the hell is
that supposed to be,

434
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,767
a giant moth?

435
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,886
Well, it's funny
you should bring it up.

436
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:57,087
That's Mothra.

437
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,822
They're trying to figure out
a way to kill it.

438
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,225
Yeah? Why don't they
just throw a wool suit over the city,

439
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,294
and when he goes
for it, zap him?

440
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,656
How'd it go, Cliff?

441
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:18,192
Oh, just fine.

442
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:19,559
Cliff, where's my chocolate?

443
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,328
You don't want to know.

444
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:32,139
So, uh, what'd I miss?

445
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,407
Why-why is
that girl,

446
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,576
uh, running around
screaming at everybody?

447
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,462
Well, she's trying to convince
them that, uh, that Godzilla's

448
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,431
merely confused and not really
trying to hurt them.

449
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,250
Isn't that the part usually
played by Akiro Nakamoto?

450
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:45,752
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:48,823
But, uh, she left halfway
through the Godzilla series.

452
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:49,924
I don't understand.

453
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,058
Why would an actress leave

454
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,527
right in the middle
of a successful series?

455
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,133
(clanking)

456
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,551
Woody, Woody,
what are you doing?

457
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,702
I'm not doing anything.

458
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:02,936
Why is the car shaking?

459
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:03,937
I don't know.

460
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,205
Well, I'm not doing anything.

461
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:06,740
Hold it. I know
what's going on here.

462
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,774
What? What is it?

463
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,442
Well, there's
a teenager back here

464
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:11,512
with a tattoo in the shape
of a flaming skull

465
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:13,814
relieving you of your tires.

466
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:15,582
(power drill whirring)

467
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,350
Geez, Ma's gonna kill me.

468
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:18,685
What are we gonna do?

469
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,120
All right, everybody
get on the floor,

470
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,555
don't make any eye contact.

471
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,889
We might have a chance.

472
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,315
All right, one more time.

473
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,382
It's Cheers.

474
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,717
The "C" is for...

475
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,834
Courtesy.
Courtesy.

476
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,153
The "H" is for...

477
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,387
Honesty.
Honesty.

478
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:38,688
The "E" is for...

479
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:39,889
Energy.
Energy.

480
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:41,291
The other "E" is for...

481
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,859
More energy.
More energy.

482
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,495
The "R" is for...

483
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,263
Right, Gus.
Right, Gus.

484
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,917
Which you "S" for "say"
when I give an order.

485
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:53,087
You know, Gus, I-I think
what the problem is here

486
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,655
that you are just being
a little too hard on us.

487
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,091
Well, thank you
very much, Miss Howe,

488
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,730
for telling me that I have to
pussyfoot around my employees.

489
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:07,034
Incidentally, in my day,
a woman in the public eye

490
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:10,403
made it her business to look
as attractive as possible.

491
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,521
What?

492
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,573
Have they stopped
making lipstick?

493
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,342
Am I that old?

494
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:16,459
Come on, Gus.

495
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,677
Gus, what are you doing, man?

496
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:19,279
You can't talk to them
like this, damn it.

497
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,413
These are my employees.

498
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:21,614
They're my friends, too.

499
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:24,000
I trained them,
and I'm gonna stand by them.

500
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:27,638
You people are the most
thoughtless, lazy bunch of slobs

501
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,973
I've ever had the misfortune
to know in my entire life!

502
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:32,359
How do you expect
to serve the public?

503
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:35,062
You people have taken
the good name of Cheers...

504
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,264
a name I worked so
hard to build up...

505
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,832
and you've turned
it into garbage.

506
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,116
And if you think

507
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:41,851
I'm a hard worker,
you should've known the guy

508
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,604
that owned this place before me.

509
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,455
He collapsed and died

510
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,174
right here in this bar,

511
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:50,143
right there where
you're standing this minute!

512
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:54,582
I realize that I cannot
fire the lot of you

513
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,516
just because you disgust me.

514
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,285
So I'm gonna do
the next best thing,

515
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:00,253
and I'm gonna walk out of here.

516
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:02,189
Now, you can have your apron,

517
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:04,925
and you can have your damn bar!

518
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,213
Sam?

519
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,836
Boy, tonight was the most fun
I've had in 20 years.

520
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,507
Oh, I thank you, all of you,
so very, very much.

521
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,610
Listen, if you people
are ever in Arizona,

522
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,045
you got a place to stay.

523
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:27,581
Oh, wait, wait, wait, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute here.

524
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:28,682
Here.

525
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:29,750
This is tonight's
receipts, you see?

526
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,317
The-the cash drawer

527
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:33,470
was full, and that's
what's-what's left over.

528
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:34,521
Good night, Sam.

529
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,672
Good night, ladies.

530
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,674
Good night, Cheers.

531
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:46,783
All right, all right, all right!

532
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,768
Okay, let's get a move on.

533
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:49,887
Let's get a move on.

534
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,271
I want to see your butts moving,

535
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,106
not your lips!
Come on!

536
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,474
Move it!
Move it!

537
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,427
Move it! Move it! Move it!

538
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:02,816
Well, thanks for
coming to the rescue.

539
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,752
Well, lucky for you they
only took the one tire.

540
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:06,853
Got the spare on.

541
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:07,921
She's as good as new.

542
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,372
So if you have
any more problems,

543
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,841
just do what you did before...

544
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,776
lean on the horn and scream
"They're killing us.

545
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,711
They're killing us."

546
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,379
Well, thank you
very much, officer.

547
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,181
And, uh, here you go.

548
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:21,051
Little something for yourself.

549
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,855
Stamps?

550
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,758
What the hell am I
gonna do with stamps?

551
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:35,132
Well, guys, you think
Godzilla there is, uh,

552
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,835
ferocious with his fire breath
and crushing buildings, huh?

553
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:42,072
Wait till you see Ma when
she gets a load of this car.

554
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,141
I'll be off on the
next boat to Rio.

555
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,277
You can say good-bye to
your old buddy, Cliff, that's for sure.

556
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,146
Well, sorry about that,
Mr. Clavin.

557
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,064
Well, you know, it's been

558
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:51,331
a pretty miserable night,
actually.

559
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:54,268
What do you say we call it
a night and head home?

560
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:56,153
Oh, no you don't, Doc.

561
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,289
We went through all this
so we could have a good time

562
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,524
at the drive-in, and that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

563
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,408
Oh, come on, Cliff.

564
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:02,409
There's only one more movie.

565
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,910
We all know what's gonna happen.

566
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,413
There's gonna be atomic testing,
Godzilla's gonna wake up,

567
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,314
gets mad, goes and eats Tokyo,

568
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:10,083
fights some other monster,
disappears into the ocean.

569
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,150
The end.

570
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:13,870
Oh, well, thanks a lot,
Dr. Crane.

571
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:19,709
Oh, look, please, you know,
you guys, I don't know,

572
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,478
your attraction to
the drive-in experience,

573
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,879
it just eludes me.

574
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,549
I mean, no wonder they're
tearing all these places down.

575
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,601
Yeah, maybe you're
right. Yeah.

576
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,771
Maybe there is something to
being out on Friday night,

577
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:33,139
and you're hanging out
with all your pals

578
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,408
and watching the movie.

579
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,944
I guess those days are gone.

580
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:40,547
Gentlemen, may I suggest that
you are not mourning the loss

581
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:44,250
of this drive-in, but rather
the loss of your youth.

582
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:47,937
Guess you're right, Doc.

583
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:49,973
Wow, it's kind of sad
when you think about it.

584
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:51,975
Mmm. Yeah.

585
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,544
Yeah, I think you hit the tail

586
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:57,414
right on the donkey
with that one, Doc.

587
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,412
Yes, it's the
superficial trappings

588
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,051
of youth that we yearn for.

589
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:04,221
We wish for time
to stand still, and why?

590
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,459
Because we are afraid
of our own mortality.

591
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,541
Sure.

592
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,860
But sooner or later,

593
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,762
it's time for men to put aside

594
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:16,232
childish things because, well,
they are no longer childs.

595
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:21,905
So, as a great poet once
said, "If I were a child..."

596
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:24,441
You know, Cliff,
uh, tell you what,

597
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,743
before we take off, why don't
you get one more look at that,

598
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,478
uh, that little popcorn girl
you were telling us about?

599
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,479
Hey, yeah.

600
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,781
Have one more tub
of that popcorn.

601
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,348
Yeah, you bet.
Tell you what, here.

602
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,584
Sweet on me,
wasn't she? My treat.

603
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:36,586
Yeah.

604
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,392
Gonna find
another parking spot?

605
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,493
Hell, no.
We're going home.

606
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:44,761
(engine starts)
