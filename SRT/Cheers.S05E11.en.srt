1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,088
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,058
I'll tell you, Woody,
the psychiatric profession

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,427
can really get rough sometimes.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,229
I think if I hear one
more person telling me

5
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,731
about one more problem, I'll explode.

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,100
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,351
Actually, I suppose you do.

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,353
Our professions are
really very much alike.

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,355
We both have to listen patiently

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,824
while people unload
their grief and suffering.

11
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,327
Sometimes it's just
more than I can bear.

12
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,245
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

13
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,698
You know, if only I had
your ability to listen

14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,200
to a person's problem,
sympathize with them,

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,203
and yet still go on about my
business calmly and happily.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,089
How do you do it, Wood?

17
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,424
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

18
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,762
You're not listening to me, are you?

19
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,964
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

20
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,133
How about a double scotch rocks?

21
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:50,884
Coming right up.

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,806

All right, here, here it is, troops.

38
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,761
The reason I called
you in was to tell you

39
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,097
I just got a chance
to go up to Moose River

40
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,483
to do some fishing with
some old baseball buddies.

41
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,435
Ah, a fishing trip.

42
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,769
Another desperate

43
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,105
yet futile attempt to forget me.

44
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,491
No, no, just another desperate

45
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,860
yet futile attempt to catch some fish.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,528
The problem is

47
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,863
I want to leave right now.

48
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,364
So, who wants to be saddled

49
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:30,250
with taking charge of
the place while I'm gone?

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,584
Oh, me, me! I do!

51
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,585
I want to!

52
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,586
Uh, wait a minute here.

53
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,588
Uh, all right, sit down, sit down.

54
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,090
I guess I'm gonna have to make

55
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,091
an executive decision here.

56
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,593
All right,

57
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,845
hold out your fists.

58
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,096
There you go.

59
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,597
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four...

60
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,099
Oh, Sam, Sam, Sam.

61
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,101
This isn't fair.

62
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,435
It isn't?

63
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,271
No-- everybody knows
that when you do

64
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,273
"one potato, two potato"
with three people,

65
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,277
you end up with the same
person with whom you started.

66
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,116
Oh, yeah, all right. Uh...

67
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,034
Oh, I got something else here.

68
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,035
All right, all right.

69
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,537
My dog died last night.

70
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,789
What color is his blood?

71
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:15,962
What kind of disgusting game is that?

72
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,915
It's something I
played when I was a kid.

73
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:19,799
Now pick a color.

74
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,000
What for?

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,335
Your dog's blood.

76
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,722
Oh, this is horrible.

77
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,591
You played this as a child?

78
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,894
Well, no wonder you're so disturbed.

79
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,896
Would you please pick a color

80
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,265
so I can spell it and
knock somebody out?

81
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:36,733
All right, mauve.

82
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,823
All right, all right, um...

83
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,776
Here we go, yeah.

84
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:47,777
We'll use a bat here.

85
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:48,778
Good idea.

86
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,164
Okay, I'm in charge!

87
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,615
Sam.

88
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,617
Actually, I, uh, had this is mind.

89
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,619
Woody, you know how to do this.

90
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,620
Here you go.

91
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,621
All right, here.

92
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,006
Oh, oh...

93
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,425
(laughing)

94
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,426
Oh!

95
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,428
He grabbed the little
knobby thing at the top.

96
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:06,429
You can't do that.

97
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:07,797
That's not part of the bat.

98
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:10,433
WOODY: The little knobby
thing is so a part of the bat.

99
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,351
Well, can he grab it?

100
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,852
Sure he can grab it. ! Yeah.

101
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,854
And then you and I get three turns

102
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,356
trying to kick it out of his fingers

103
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,224
and the one who kicks it out wins.

104
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,693
Well, how do we decide who kicks first?

105
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,195
One potato, two potato...

106
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,696
Oh!

107
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,698
You're going to have to make a decision

108
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,701
like a rational adult human being.

109
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,203
All right, all right.

110
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,205
Okay, Woody's my man.

111
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,206
Oh! Oh, no!

112
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,458
Come on! Why Woody?

113
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,793
Well, because he's the only person

114
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,795
who hasn't irritated the hell out of me

115
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,163
in the last five minutes.

116
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,547
Come on. Get out of here.

117
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,550
Let me, uh, go over some of
the management rules with him.

118
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,551
Go on, go on.

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,842
I think you're really gonna
enjoy this weekend, boss.

120
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,230
Okay,
first rule--

121
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,766
keep this with you at all times.

122
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,158
Oh, Woody, here's a letter from Indiana.

123
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,493
Oh, boy!

124
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:12,996
It's from my girlfriend, Beth.

125
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,914
So how are things in the
great Midwest, huh, Woods?

126
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,750
Well, let's everybody gather
'round and we'll find out, huh?

127
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,086
Oh, great, let's pull up the stove,

128
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,089
whittle a tetch and chaw some tabacky.

129
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,510
Boy, Beth writes the
greatest letters in the world.

130
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,013
I can't wait for you guys to hear this.

131
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,433
"Dear Woody,

132
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,435
"this is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write.

133
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,938
"What I have to say is that
I care about you very much,

134
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,441
"but I'm afraid we can't
stay together anymore.

135
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,943
"You see, I've fallen in
love with Leonard Twilley

136
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,445
"and we're flying up to Niagara Falls

137
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,946
"on the 20th to be married.

138
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,449
"We're gonna drop by
and see you on our way.

139
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,317
"I feel I have to explain in person.

140
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,702
"I hope you understand

141
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,704
"and find it in your
heart to forgive me.

142
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,707
See you Saturday. Love, Beth."

143
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:03,212
Well, this isn't quite as
good as her usual letters.

144
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,752
I'm so sorry, Woody.

145
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:11,254
I can't believe it.

146
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:13,256
Beth and Leonard Twilley.

147
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,258
Woody, today's Saturday, you know.

148
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,759
Uh, she could be here any minute.

149
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,146
Gosh, I'm feeling kind of bad.

150
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,647
Listen, if you'll excuse me,

151
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,649
I think I'd like to be alone now.

152
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,074
Oh, I guess it'd be easier if I left.

153
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,494
Uh, wait a sec, Wood.

154
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,863
You know, maybe this is really

155
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,364
a blessing in disguise.

156
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,367
You see, sometimes in
order to achieve maturity,

157
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,370
it's necessary to disengage
oneself from relationships

158
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,372
that keep one's growth rooted

159
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,375
in an artificially
prolonged period of stasis.

160
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,877
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

161
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,264
Woody, come on.

162
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,517
Sometimes things work out
for the best, you know?

163
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,801
Look at it this way.

164
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,803
Boston's crawling with
beautiful, single women.

165
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,305
Just get on out there.

166
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,689
CLIFF: Yeah, he's right, you know.

167
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,691
Take it from one who knows.

168
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,061
Yeah, but since Sammy's not
here, just take it from us.

169
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,564
CLIFF: Yeah, you know, he
is, uh, right there, Woody.

170
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,399
You know, the best way
to forget about Beth

171
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,901
is go out there, find some skirt,

172
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,871
have her, use her and throw her away.

173
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,373
Maybe you guys are right.

174
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,875
Maybe the best way to get over this

175
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,379
is to make wild, crazy, passionate love

176
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,382
to the first available
woman who comes along.

177
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,884
Woody, don't listen to them.

178
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,387
It's not necessary for you to suppress

179
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,389
your grief in debauchery.

180
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,392
It's important for you to experience it.

181
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,895
People grow from intense suffering.

182
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,263
Yeah? Then how come

183
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,766
I haven't grown an inch
since I've known you?

184
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:55,908
Oh, boy, Normie, look at this.

185
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,411
Another psychic's head exploded.

186
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,417
Kind of makes you wonder why anyone

187
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,420
goes into that line of work, doesn't it?

188
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,422
Excuse me.

189
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,924
I've been experiencing
grief all afternoon

190
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,426
and instead of killing myself,

191
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,428
I'd like to take you out to dinner.

192
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,930
Sounds great, but no thank you.

193
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,433
Did I say it was my treat?

194
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,439
Woody, you've hit on nearly
every woman in the bar.

195
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,940
Why are you so persistent?

196
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,942
Well, when Beth gets here, you know,

197
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,445
I want to show her that
I got someone else, too.

198
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,946
If there's one thing I can't stand,

199
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,948
it's that look of pity in her eyes.

200
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,950
I'm sure she's far too wrapped up

201
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,454
in her own happiness to
have time to pity you.

202
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,208
Well, that is a comfort.

203
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,829
Hi, Woody.

204
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:50,830
Oh, hi, Beth.

205
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,832
Hi, Leonard.

206
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,217
Did you get my letter?

207
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,968
Yeah, I got it.

208
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,836
Are you mad?

209
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,804
Oh, no, I'm not mad at all.

210
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,806
You know, you're the
last person in the world

211
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,308
I ever wanted to hurt.

212
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,809
Hey, I'm fine, really.

213
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,811
Can I get you guys something to drink?

214
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,812
Wine.

215
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,314
How 'bout a brewski?

216
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,315
Brewski...

217
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,321
Woody, we didn't mean
for this to happen.

218
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,823
It was fate.

219
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,825
I was in Fryer's Hardware Store

220
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,827
looking at some copper tubing.

221
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,830
Beth was buying a lawn
sprinkler and, well...

222
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,333
I never stood a chance.

223
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,453
Oh, Leonard, I can't stand it.

224
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,954
Look what we've done to him.

225
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,457
I know, it's worse than
I thought it would be.

226
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:35,458
Oh, please, guys, don't do that.

227
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,460
How can we happily walk down the aisle

228
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,461
knowing we're leaving
him here like this?

229
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,463
I won't be in the mood for any cake.

230
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:41,464
Beth... Leonard...

231
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,965
I keep getting

232
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,467
this picture of you sitting alone

233
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,968
in your room, night after night,

234
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:47,970
and it makes me want to cry.

235
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,854
DIANE: Hi, Beth.

236
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,523
Nice to meet you, Leonard.

237
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,859
Woody, uh, don't you think it's time

238
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,361
to tell Beth
about you-know-who?

239
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,862
Who?

240
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,365
Well, that lovely young lady

241
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,233
you've been seeing so much of.

242
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,201
Is this true?

243
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,119
Yes.

244
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,039
Well, I'm glad you found someone, Woody.

245
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,541
What's she like?

246
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,043
Well, uh, uh, she's about four, five,

247
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,044
five, five feet

248
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,546
four or five.

249
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,047
She's kind of hard to describe.

250
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,552
Cornflower blue eyes,

251
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,054
titian hair, Raphaelesque figure.

252
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,424
And she smells good.

253
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,093
I feel so much better

254
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,312
knowing you won't be alone.

255
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,147
Well...

256
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,566
Come on, Leonard. We'd better be going.

257
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,853
It was nice seeing you, Woody.

258
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,189
Bye, Beth.

259
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,607
Good luck.

260
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,859
Yeah, good luck, Beth.

261
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:46,662
DIANE: Well, it's too
bad you two had to leave.

262
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:48,030
I know you would have

263
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,031
enjoyed meeting Woody's girlfriend.

264
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,032
She's extraordinary.

265
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,534
Yeah, we could have had dinner tonight.

266
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,919
Actually our plane doesn't
leave till midnight.

267
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,421
Oh, that's right.

268
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,923
Well, we can all have dinner together.

269
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,342
Oh, great.

270
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,343
8:00 okay?

271
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:01,711
Yeah, fine.

272
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,133
Way to go, Miss Chambers.

273
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,634
What am I gonna do now?

274
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,635
I'm sorry, Woody.

275
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,137
I have a strict rule

276
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,140
about meddling in
other people's affairs.

277
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,268
Why did Miss Chambers have to
shoot my big mouth off for me?

278
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,723
Boy, this is the worst thing
that's ever happened to anybody.

279
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,641
Oh, I don't know about that, Woody.

280
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,644
Uh, did you ever have your head explode?

281
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,899
Woody, as a way of apologizing,

282
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,400
let me try to think

283
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,402
of another way out of this.

284
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,403
Now, let's see.

285
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,790
I'm sure we can think of something.

286
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,577
Well, it better be good,
'cause I need a date quick.

287
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,081
Oh, boy, it's too bad
Sammy's not here to help ya.

288
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,083
Hey, Sammy may not be here,

289
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,585
but his inventory is.

290
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,586
Yeah, Woody.

291
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,587
Oh, hey, hey, hey...

292
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,588
Woody,

293
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,974
put that down on the bar very carefully

294
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,975
and walk away.

295
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,678
Yeah, it's a little bit too hot

296
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,180
for you to handle there, Woodman.

297
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,181
I'll tell ya what I'll do.

298
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:14,433
I'll give you the number
of one of my tootsies.

299
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,103
I think he'd prefer something

300
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,104
that lives above ground.

301
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,942
Wait a minute.

302
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,777
Do you really think it's proper

303
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,780
to be rifling through
a man's personal papers?

304
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,783
No matter how close a
friend, no matter how...

305
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,034
Miss Chambers, you're in here.

306
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,370
Give me that.

307
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,871
"Diane Chambers.

308
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,374
"Probably the most
incredible woman I ever met.

309
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:39,875
Don't you agree, Diane?"

310
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,377
Well...

311
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,849
Hey, here's one.

312
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,850
Three stars.

313
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,186
"Tina Wilson.

314
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,138
Fun, sexy, easy."

315
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,140
Well, she sounds interesting.

316
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,142
And you know just what to do

317
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,526
with sweet Tina Wilson.

318
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,813
Have her, use her, and
I'll throw her away.

319
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,616
I don't think you're
going to get an answer.

320
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,067
Why not?

321
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,820
I'm sweet Tina Wilson.

322
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,708
Well, what would be a
good time to call you?

323
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,714
Ah, it's not workin'.

324
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,715
I'm no good at this.

325
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,834
No, no, no, Woody.
Don't give up so easily.

326
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,552
Oh, here's one.

327
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,806
Oh, oh, look at this here,
the ultimate one, too, huh?

328
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
She's got a whole page to herself.

329
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah!

330
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,759
"Desiree Harrison."

331
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,761
Oh, look at all those stars.

332
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,263
Yeah, any more stars

333
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,265
you'd have to pledge allegiance to her.

334
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,266
Yeah, hey.

335
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,768
"The best, the best, the best."

336
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,771
Hey, get on the horn there, Woods.

337
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,274
Woody, something tells
me you shouldn't do this.

338
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:46,775
Please reconsider.

339
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,278
Oh, that's easy for you to
say. You got him into this.

340
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,280
Why don't you do something
extraordinary for once

341
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,164
and butt out?

342
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,586
What do I say to her?

343
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,422
Uh, tell her you're a
friend of Sam Malone.

344
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,675
Good.

345
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,961
Hi, uh, De, Desiree?

346
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,346
Yeah, I'm a friend of Sam Malone.

347
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,100
Hold on. She wants to know why I called.

348
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,352
Tell her that, uh, Sammy
said she was the best.

349
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,221
And you want to find out for yourself.

350
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,190
Oh, good. Uh, yeah,
Sam says you're the best

351
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,693
and I wanna find out for myself.

352
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:21,694
Hold on.

353
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,062
She wants to know my name.

354
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,530
Wing it.

355
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,533
Yeah, it's Woody Boyd.

356
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,035
Yeah, how about 7:00 tonight?

357
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,287
Yeah?

358
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,621
Okay, uh, well,

359
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,624
I'll see ya here in the bar.

360
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,625
Great. Ha-ha!

361
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,626
All right, Woody!

362
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:42,498
Well, seein' as how
it's Gomer's night out...

363
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,585
...that leaves me in charge of the bar.

364
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,054
Oh, not necessarily.

365
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,392
Woody, who do you assign
to take command of the bar?

366
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,645
Well, I don't know how to
choose between the two of you.

367
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,931
Oh, I know, I know.
We're both your friends.

368
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,932
No, it's not that.

369
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,433
You ruined "one potato, two potato."

370
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,938
Okay, why don't we let the bar decide?

371
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,356
Well, that seems

372
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:09,325
the fair and democratic thing to do.

373
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,776
(clanking fork)

374
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:15,281
We should each make a speech
presenting our best arguments

375
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,783
as to why we should
be in charge of the bar

376
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,285
and we'll leave it up to you.

377
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,287
Carla, the floor is yours,

378
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,789
and not for the first time, I might add.

379
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:33,299
If I'm elected, no way
will Diane make a speech.

380
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,684
(cheering)

381
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:40,556
Whoo! Whoo!

382
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,946
(patrons whistling)

383
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,281
Hey, hubba-hubba!

384
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,950
How do I look? Is my tie crooked?

385
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,118
Uh, no, but your pants are on backwards.

386
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,823
Made ya look. Made ya look.

387
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,124
That's very funny, Mr. Clavin,

388
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,627
but I guess I'm not in the
mood for that clever humor.

389
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,630
Yeah, you and the rest of creation.

390
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,583
Yeah, I'm worried about
my date with, uh, Desiree.

391
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,084
She's one of Sam's women.

392
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,470
She may be too much for one man.

393
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,976
Is there somebody here named Woody?

394
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,810
Yeah.

395
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,311
I'm Desiree.

396
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,681
Uh, just a minute, please.

397
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,768
Is it me or does she look different

398
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,152
than she did on the phone?

399
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,905
She comes highly
recommended by the master.

400
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,407
All right, here goes nothin'.

401
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,827
So you're Desiree?

402
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,694
Yeah.

403
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,579
Hi, I'm Woody.

404
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,581
Can I get your coat?

405
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,118
What's she doin' here?

406
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:45,120
That's Woody's date.

407
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,623
Woody's goin' out with
Sam's cleaning lady?

408
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,627
Cleaning lady?

409
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,630
That's right. Sam says she's the best.

410
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,134
So how are you?

411
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,135
Fine. Shall we get started?

412
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,637
What? Right, right here?

413
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,306
Here or in the back if you prefer.

414
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,642
Well, don't you want any dinner first?

415
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,143
No, I'd like to get right to it.

416
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:10,529
I'll stop to eat when
I get a little tired.

417
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,814
Wow.

418
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,199
I figure you probably
have your own equipment.

419
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,201
If not, I have mine out in the car.

420
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,704
What sort of equipment?

421
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,706
Well, the first thing
we'll need is a bucket.

422
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,707
Really?

423
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,709
Yeah, and some rubber gloves

424
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,711
and one of those really hard
brushes with a long handle.

425
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,466
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

426
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,802
Well, I need something to get
to those hard-to-reach places.

427
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,806
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

428
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:42,511
Guys, I think there's things
about Sam that we don't know.

429
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,012
No, no, Woody, she's not Sam's date.

430
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:45,514
She's his maid.

431
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:46,515
Yeah, Carla told us.

432
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:47,516
Those stars mean

433
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:49,518
she's the best housekeeper around.

434
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,023
Oh, boy, do I feel stupid!

435
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:56,525
What am I gonna do now?

436
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:59,278
Maybe you should, uh,
tell her the truth.

437
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:02,397
Yeah, yeah, okay.

438
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,202
Uh, listen, ma'am,

439
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,204
I think there's been a terrible mistake.

440
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:10,706
I don't think I'm gonna be...

441
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:12,091
Hi, Woody.

442
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,761
So that's what you call titian hair.

443
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,879
Hi,

444
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm Beth.

445
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,264
I'm Desiree.

446
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,100
This is my fiancé, Leonard.

447
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,384
Good.

448
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:29,391
Yeah, they're gonna be joining us

449
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,893
for dinner tonight.

450
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,394
Dinner?

451
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,397
You wanna take me out to dinner?

452
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,899
Yeah. So what do you say?

453
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:40,152
Well, it beats scrubbin'
grout with a toothbrush.

454
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:44,490
You folks and your
big-city expressions.

455
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,992
Yes, I thought we'd eat at Melville's,

456
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,877
if that's okay with you, ma'am.

457
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,745
Okay.

458
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:56,135
I was expecting someone
a little younger, Woody.

459
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
Me, too.

460
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,393
That was fun.

461
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,894
Nice seein' ya.

462
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,396
Listen, have a nice marriage.

463
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,398
Well, didn't somebody mention dancing?

464
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,899
We still have time
before our plane leaves.

465
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,901
Now you want to take me dancing?

466
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,270
It sure beats scrubbin'
grout with a toothbrush.

467
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,190
Hey, I could live here.

468
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,691
Let me go freshen up.

469
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,695
Oh, dancing. I hope my knees hold out.

470
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,082
Is it any wonder I love her?

471
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,450
I like her, Woody.

472
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,452
Yeah, listen, why don't
you two have a seat?

473
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:31,954
I'll get you somethin' to drink.

474
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,964
Woody...

475
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,966
I know I got you into this,

476
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,968
but it's time to stop.

477
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,469
I know Beth hurt you,

478
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,972
but she doesn't deserve to be lied to.

479
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,474
Besides, would your
mother be proud of you

480
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,977
if she knew what you were doing?

481
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,981
Let Beth know how you feel.

482
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,483
I think it would do you both good.

483
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,486
You're right, Miss Chambers.

484
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,488
I guess I owe Beth that much.

485
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:15,047
Oh, you won't tell my mother, will you?

486
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,548
Mum's the word.

487
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,052
You won't tell my mum, will you?

488
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,396
Excuse me, uh, Beth, can I talk

489
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,397
to you for a moment?

490
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,399
Sure, Woody. Excuse us, Leonard.

491
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,903
Sure. You're not gonna steal her

492
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,404
back from me, are you, Woody?

493
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,906
Go drink your beer, Leonard.

494
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,908
Yes, dear.

495
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,914
Uh, listen, Beth.

496
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,920
Desiree's not my girlfriend.

497
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,290
Well, I had a feeling.

498
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,676
What gave it away?

499
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,544
When she forgot your name during dinner.

500
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,964
See, I was so hurt,

501
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,716
I, I didn't want you to
think that I was on my own.

502
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,434
I'm sorry.

503
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,220
But you know we couldn't have lasted.

504
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,722
We've grown apart.

505
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:16,108
We're just too different now.

506
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,610
You're the adventurous type.

507
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,112
I just want to settle down.

508
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,481
I love you, Beth.

509
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,784
I love you, too, Woody.

510
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,655
Leonard's more a part of my world.

511
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,657
Well, maybe I could
move back to Indiana.

512
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,575
Do you want to do that?

513
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:35,577
No.

514
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:38,580
And I could never live in Boston, so...

515
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,466
how does that leave us?

516
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,086
Real sad.

517
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,804
Yeah.

518
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,639
Well, I hope you get happy.

519
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,560
There's, uh, something
I want to give you.

520
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,561
Oh, no, it's okay.

521
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,062
The drinks are on me.

522
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,063
No. (chuckles)

523
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,565
I meant this.

524
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,437
Good-bye, Woody.

525
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:08,026
That, Leonard, is, uh,
how the tractor was born.

526
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,833
Come on, Leonard. We
have a plane to catch.

527
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,286
Okay. Well, good-bye.

528
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,288
You guys ever find
yourselves in Indiana,

529
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,289
you know what to do.

530
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,043
Yeah, run screamin' to the airport.

531
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,764
See ya, Woody.

532
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,098
Bye, Leonard.

533
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,099
You take care of her.

534
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,351
I will.

535
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,136
You better.

536
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,527
Are you okay, Woody?

537
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,532
Well, I feel pretty bad.

538
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,534
It hurts, but at least it's settled.

539
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,037
Now I can go back to
bein' Woody Boyd again.

540
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,038
Oh, hey, Woody Boyd,

541
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,540
what about Mrs. Clean in the back there?

542
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,410
Come on, you guys.

543
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,161
Take it easy.

544
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,163
She happens to be a very nice lady.

545
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,048
We had a good time tonight.

546
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,417
She talked about all kinds
of interesting things:

547
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,802
movies, sports...

548
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,086
How to get cat hair out of the drapes.

549
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,588
(all laugh)

550
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,761
Good-bye, Woody.

551
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,263
Uh, no, Desiree, please, don't go.

552
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,765
I'm not stupid.

553
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,768
Don't pay any attention to them.

554
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,271
Look, I'm not exactly sure
what happened here tonight.

555
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,272
Something tells me

556
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,774
you got trapped into this.

557
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,275
So I'm gonna let you off the hook.

558
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,276
Now, look,

559
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,278
when, when I talked
to you earlier today,

560
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,280
I admit I thought you
were somebody else.

561
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,782
But I had fun tonight.

562
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,783
I like you.

563
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:42,170
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is

564
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,457
I need somebody to talk to.

565
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,343
What'd you have in mind?

566
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,294
I don't know.

567
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,547
I, uh, thought maybe a cup of coffee.

568
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:55,383
Sure. Why not?

569
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,853
This isn't gonna turn

570
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,356
into one of those
May/December romances, is it?

571
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,858
Well, with the holidays comin' up,

572
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,227
December's no good, but May's okay.
