00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:07,339
NO HELP WANTED

2
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:24,102
When I hear "A Foggy Day
In London Town", I think of my wife.

3
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:26,270
Was that your song, Coach?

4
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:33,568
No, but Sinatra sang that and it always
reminds me of "From Here To Eternity".

5
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:38,823
- You took her to see it on the first date?
- No, it reminds me of Hawaii.

6
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,991
You and your wife met in Hawaii?

7
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:46,829
No, I've never been to Hawaii.
Neither has Wally Engels.

8
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,958
I'll take it. Coach, who's Wally Engels?

9
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,670
An old paI of mine in the navy.
He introduced me to my wife.

10
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,550
Boy,
that's some memory you've got there.

11
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:14,685
- That song brings back great memories.
- Really? What?

12
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:17,687
They played it
the day my daughter got married.

13
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,360
That's all.

14
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,446
We sure get 'em in here, don't we?

15
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,342
Hello, Sam.

16
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:52,221
- Hey, Becky. Boy, long time no see.
- I finally got transferred back to Boston.

17
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:58,518
I missed this city and its landmarks.
Speaking of which, when do you get off?

18
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:01,146
I don't get off any more, Becky.

19
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:09,903
What I meant by that was Diane
and I are going together here.

20
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,155
- Who?
- Diane, this is Becky Hawley.

21
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:20,703
Diane and I have been going together
for what? Nine, ten months?

22
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,373
- Four.
- Whatever.

23
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,293
I'm glad to see
you have a nice thing going,

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,713
although I must say
I will miss the fun we used to have.

25
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:39,302
I got something a lot better than fun.
I got good solid pleasantness.

26
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,097
You're a reaI rush yourself.

27
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,641
- I didn't mean to upset anyone.
- You didn't.

28
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:52,062
I've come to terms with Sam's past.
Besides, I'm not the jealous type.

29
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,148
- Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Good to see you again.

30
00:03:56,315 --> 00:04:01,569
- You, too.
- Why don't I walk you to your car?

31
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,742
On second thoughts, I'll stand in the bar.

32
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,413
- I liked her.
- I'll bet.

33
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:24,046
Have an accident, Sam,
or are you just glad to see me?

34
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:27,424
Both.

35
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,136
Two Cutty rocks.
Norm's late again today.

36
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:37,558
I noticed. It's eating into my beer profits.
I'll have to raise prices to get even.

37
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:41,144
That'll be $11, Cliff.

38
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,896
He hasn't been in
before five o'clock all week.

39
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:48,150
You don't suppose he finally got a job?

40
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:51,861
If Norm had a job,
he'd have told us about it.

41
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,737
I hope he didn't tell me and I forgot.

42
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:58,408
I'd remember forgetting
something that big.

43
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:03,537
Cliff's right. If Norm got a job,
he would have made it a big deaI.

44
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,957
You know, yesterday I saw something
very disturbing.

45
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,750
The price of peroxide went up?

46
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:13,879
I was born a blonde.

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,214
What were you saying?

48
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:23,303
Well, on my way here, I saw a fellow
who looked very much like Norman,

49
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:27,306
sneaking in the back door
of Melville's kitchen.

50
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:32,101
I said hi, but he pulled his coat
over his face and ran inside.

51
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:35,396
Why would he be in Melville's kitchen?

52
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:40,567
I think he's been reduced
to taking a job as a dishwasher.

53
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:47,822
No. Norm would never stoop to that. He
probably went in to beg for table scraps.

54
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:53,410
- Wait a minute. I thought of something.
- I thought I heard a clank.

55
00:05:55,454 --> 00:06:00,416
About a week ago, Norm asked me
if a reaI man would wash dishes.

56
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:06,671
- I don't believe it.
- Impossible to escape the conclusion.

57
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,882
I found a way.

58
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:16,930
I'm not going to believe that my buddy
has been reduced to scrubbing pots.

59
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:21,850
If he had, there's be signs.
He'd be reeking like a mackereI.

60
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,854
Go on! Beat it! Scram! Get out of here!

61
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,652
Beat it! Get out of here!

62
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,449
Go on! Get out of here!

63
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,120
That proves it.
He's either washing dishes,

64
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,289
or driving a herd of cats to Dodge City.

65
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:54,460
He'd need at least 200 head
for that drive to Dodge.

66
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,878
Afternoon, everybody.

67
00:06:57,045 --> 00:07:02,383
- Can I draw you a beer?
- I know what they look like. Pour one.

68
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,594
What's with all the cats?

69
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:09,764
- Animals like me.
- Good. Cos no human is gonna.

70
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,811
Norm,
you smell like low tide in Bridgeport.

71
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:22,565
- It must be that tuna sandwich I ate.
- What did you do, eat it or roll in it?

72
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:26,069
Everything OK? Any luck finding a job?

73
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:30,948
- Let's just drop it.
- Here, Normie. You need a napkin.

74
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:35,952
Look at your hands.
They're all red and wrinkled.

75
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,245
So's your brain.

76
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:45,584
I'm sorry, Coach. Everybody, I'm sorry.
I might as well come clean here.

77
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:48,379
Please!

78
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:55,217
I'm washing dishes. The unemployment
ran out. I had to do something.

79
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:58,762
Give me your hands.
This'll cut the smell.

80
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:02,348
Norman,
you must be hopelessly depressed.

81
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:08,061
Last night I was so depressed,
I almost jumped out my window.

82
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:12,606
There were so many cats,
they would have broken the fall.

83
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:16,025
Those guys are only a scouting party.

84
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:20,612
Go on! Get out of here!

85
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,451
There's dignity in any work.
Don't be ashamed.

86
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:32,998
I know exactly how Normie feels. When
I was a youngster, I was a busboy.

87
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:38,252
And the getting ordered around,
it's more than a man can take.

88
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,589
- Get a beer over here, Grandpa.
- Right away.

89
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:48,760
Dishwasher. I guess I've sunk about
as low as an accountant can sink.

90
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:54,932
I was 30th in my class. Now I spend
my afternoons watching lettuce float.

91
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:59,519
Norman, you're an accountant.
You should be accounting.

92
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:02,938
Sam, put Norman on as your accountant.

93
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:06,650
- That would be fabulous.
- I already have one.

94
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:10,028
Well, fire him and hire Norman.

95
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:13,697
- Can I speak to you over here?
- Certainly.

96
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:19,535
- Don't you think it's a good idea?
- I want to tell her how much I like it.

97
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:23,414
Ms Chambers is going
to get a buss on the cheek.

98
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,374
Let's hope it's going at least 80.

99
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,130
No. Listen.

100
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:39,218
There are two areas of my life I don't
want touched. I've told you about one.

101
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:43,555
- And I didn't.
- You've been very good about that.

102
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:48,726
The other area is my business.
I worked very hard to get this bar.

103
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:53,730
Now you've got me turning
my books over to a dishwasher.

104
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:58,984
- He's not a dishwasher. He's a friend.
- Right, he's my friend.

105
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:04,906
How do I know he's a good accountant?
He hasn't been hired for over a year.

106
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:08,617
So he's highly motivated
to do a good job.

107
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:12,203
Keep him on long enough
to get his pride back.

108
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,165
I won't put you on the spot.
I don't have to be your accountant.

109
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:21,878
- I can always just kill myself.
- This man has options here.

110
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:27,674
Sam, now, it's true,
hiring Norman has emotionaI overtones,

111
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,470
but, without emotions,
the mind becomes a stagnant pond.

112
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:38,224
Let's face it, in your case, we're not
dealing with white water rapids.

113
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,603
OK. All right, fine. I'll put Norm on.

114
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,857
But when I fire him, you'll be responsible
for him losing all his self-respect.

115
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:53,070
How can we miss
with such a positive attitude?

116
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,155
Norm, you're my new accountant.

117
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,367
Sammy, I am honoured.

118
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:04,703
This is one of the great moments
of my life.

119
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,083
- One of your great moments?
- There have only been two.

120
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,586
I know this is out of pity,
but you got the best accountant.

121
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:17,423
- I'll second that.
- That he's the best?

122
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,258
That he's doing it out of pity.

123
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:31,892
Here he is. Norm "Render Unto Caesar
That Which Is Zilch" Peterson!

124
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:38,565
- Diane, more coffee, please.
- I'm proud of you.

125
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,733
There's a job to do
and you put beer aside.

126
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,737
- I want to do a good job for Sammy.
- Isn't that nice?

127
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:50,324
- Isn't that nice, Sam?
- How's it going, Norm?

128
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,743
Almost done.
You won't be disappointed.

129
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,331
I found a few things. You'll have the best
tax return ever to be audited.

130
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:02,418
Lighten up, will you? It's a tax joke.

131
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:08,422
There's a bounce in his step
I haven't seen in months.

132
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,135
Tonight may be a turning point
in his life. His job complete.

133
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,930
- He may even make amends with Vera.
- That would be wonderfuI.

134
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:24,518
Or he might drink till he passes out with
his head in the toilet. Too close to call.

135
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:29,105
I hope he's not trying too hard
to impress me.

136
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:33,443
What if he is? You helped him out.
He appreciates that.

137
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,862
I don't like taking chances with the IRS.

138
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:42,158
I was satisfied with my old accountant.
I paid three grand in taxes.

139
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:46,953
There's be no trouble.
That's all I want from Norm. No risks.

140
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,540
- You worry. He's a great accountant.
- How do you know?

141
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,752
My mother said everybody
has one thing they're great at.

142
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,299
With Norm, we've eliminated everything
but accountant and great white hunter.

143
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,719
- Here we go, Sam.
- How'd it come out, Norm?

144
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:11,598
- I'II let my return speak for itself.
- I'm getting back $15,000?

145
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,560
We make camp here, Bwana.

146
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:29,478
Of course babies can eat pizza.
Put it in the blender.

147
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:33,939
Do you have a cigarette machine?

148
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,026
- Back room.
- Thank you, beautifuI.

149
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:40,028
- What did you call me?
- BeautifuI.

150
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,156
- Sounded different the first time.
- BeautifuI.

151
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,366
That was the word.

152
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,370
Afternoon, everybody.

153
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:55,499
- A beer, Norm?
- I'm high on life.

154
00:13:55,665 --> 00:14:01,462
Of course beer is my life. There's
my boss man. How's it going, buddy?

155
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,131
Pretty good.
Waiting for that big tax refund.

156
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:08,218
What are you going to do with it?

157
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:13,013
I think that some of it should go
for something sheer, sexy

158
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,017
and a little breathtaking,
for the speciaI someone in his life.

159
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:21,603
You're right.
Are you an extra large, Norm?

160
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,732
In peignoirs,
but I can squeeze into a large teddy.

161
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,526
Wait. You gotta check these out.

162
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:38,367
Printed matches. "Norm Peterson
Incorporated, An Accountancy Firm. "

163
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:42,787
- That's very impressive.
- Business must be good.

164
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:49,334
Yeah. It just took Sammy having faith in
me and my getting a little faith in myself.

165
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:53,504
- Bingo.
- How many new clients have you got?

166
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:57,632
Just one, but I've been hustling
and I got some nibbles.

167
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,511
Which reminds me.
Diane, here's your return.

168
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:07,849
- Nice refund.
- I thought you'd like that.

169
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:11,268
Those psychiatrist fees
were deductible.

170
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:15,730
Those sessions in February,
we're talking a gold mine.

171
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,317
Shut up. I'm better.

172
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,991
February was a rough month, wasn't it?

173
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:34,662
What you've done for Norman
is a miracle. I'm proud of you.

174
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,623
- It was nothing.
- Don't be modest.

175
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,833
You stood by him.

176
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,587
When he said you were getting
$15,000, even I blanched

177
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:49,466
and money means no more to me
than it does to beasts in the field.

178
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,635
Sammy, give me a hand with this stuff.

179
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,638
Coach, will you get that?

180
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:01,642
- Cheers. It's for you.
- I'm busy. Take a message.

181
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:04,520
Can I take a message? He's busy.

182
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,192
It was your accountant.
He was saying...

183
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:16,488
Bell Day.

184
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:23,076
And he said your tax returns are ready.

185
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:29,165
- What the hell's going on here?
- Do you mean about Bell Day?

186
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:33,585
Did you send in the return
I prepared for you or not?

187
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:35,795
No, Norm, I didn't.

188
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,340
Why not?

189
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:45,011
I should have said. I'm conservative
when it comes to money.

190
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:49,806
Let me get this straight.
You don't trust me or my work.

191
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:52,893
So you had somebody else
do your taxes.

192
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:58,063
A $15,000 refund scared me.
I've never gotten a refund before.

193
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,483
You know why?
That accountant is a wimp.

194
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,319
The guy wouldn't know a deduction
if he sat on it.

195
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:10,198
What are you trying to say,
that Norm pulled a $15,000 boner?

196
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:16,536
I was trying to protect myself.
You would have done the same thing.

197
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,414
Come on. You would and you know it.

198
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,921
Let's drop this. I didn't want Norm
to do my taxes in the first place.

199
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,964
You don't do business with friends.

200
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:36,385
Then you're safe going into business
with anybody in this room.

201
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:39,639
Come on. Isn't anybody on my side?

202
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:46,061
AII I wanted to do was protect
my business and not offend Norm.

203
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:52,190
I'm standing by you. I may not agree
with you, but I admire your courage.

204
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:57,611
- You do?
- I've stood against the majority.

205
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:02,407
Resisting public opinion
for the sake of personaI principle.

206
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,617
Is that right? Like what?

207
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:09,037
In my senior year,
I fought to integrate my sorority.

208
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:12,791
You hear this?
They wouldn't let blacks in?

209
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,293
It wasn't blacks. That's not the point.

210
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,836
What was it, some other race?

211
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:23,091
A religion?

212
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:26,510
- It wasn't a religion.
- Come on. Who?

213
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:31,806
What? Who wouldn't they let in?

214
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:37,852
Girls with poorly-publicised
coming-out parties.

215
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:45,233
Within a couple of months,
they blended right in.

216
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,988
- You don't trust me as a friend.
- Stop right there.

217
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:56,242
- You separate business from friendship.
- I'm separating you from my life.

218
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:00,413
If I get into trouble with the IRS,
I could go to jaiI

219
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,582
and you know
what happens to pretty boys in jaiI.

220
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:11,130
- Your attitude is unprofessionaI.
- You know what you are?

221
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:15,425
- Don't say anything...
- You're a backstabber.

222
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:18,009
- You're a big baby.
- Hair hat.

223
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:21,430
- Ham-hock.
- Gooseneck. This is fun.

224
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:26,058
We are not the ones fighting,
spaghetti breath.

225
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:29,936
- You're a bad guy.
- You're getting on my nerves.

226
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:34,148
- The truth hurts?
- Will you listen to yourselves?

227
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:37,568
Standing there, arguing, bickering!

228
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,987
You're making
a mockery out of Bell Day!

229
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:51,162
Sammy, I've just been through
the roughest year of my life.

230
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:54,414
What kept me going
was a belief in myself.

231
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:57,500
I hoped somebody would believe in me.

232
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:01,587
- I thought it was you.
- You're laying a guilt trip.

233
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:04,630
- That stinks.
- I'm going for good.

234
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:09,135
Don't come back here
thinking this will blow over.

235
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:15,139
As a matter of fact,
I don't want you back in my bar again.

236
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:17,933
Fine. You got it.

237
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,770
I gotta settle one thing with him.

238
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:26,690
Norman, wait.
Don't do anything silly. Please.

239
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:31,527
Stay out. It is part of the male rituaI
you know nothing about.

240
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:36,490
- Coming in!
- How do you want to do this?

241
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,994
I don't want to go.

242
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:47,499
Hey. Come on. I didn't mean that you...

243
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,548
Come on. Listen.

244
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:02,720
We're not going to get anywhere
unless you start acting like an adult.

245
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,930
Come on.

246
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:12,561
Here.

247
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:26,155
This bar's all I have, Sam.
The people are my family.

248
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:32,869
- You're my brother.
- You're my brother, too.

249
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:55,179
Norm, you're my accountant.

250
00:21:57,263 --> 00:22:00,976
- You mean it, Sam?
- Right after this tax season.

251
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:07,522
I'll take it, but I don't want to beg.

252
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:18,531
The roots of physicaI aggression in the
male is found in the DNA molecule itself.

253
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:24,744
Right up here.
About one o'clock, as I recall.

254
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,414
- Fascinating, Cliff.
- Yes, fascinating.

255
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,710
Hold onto your hat, too, because the
very letters DNA are an acronym

256
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,130
for the words
"Dames Are Not Aggressive".

257
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:44,093
They stand for deoxyribonucleic acid.

258
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,848
Yes, but parse that in a Latin declension
and my point is still moot.

259
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,272
If a little knowledge is dangerous,
you are a walking time bomb.

260
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,481
Thank you, Diane.

261
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:05,193
Let's talk about the gas turbine engine.

262
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,908
- Coach, buy my buddy a beer.
- Coming up.

263
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,785
So you didn't resort to violence?

264
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:18,788
I want you to meet my new accountant.

265
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:23,792
Congratulations.

266
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:28,379
I've been with the wrong guy
for the last ten years.

267
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:31,882
- Thanks, Sam.
- Thank you, Norm.

268
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,053
This is such a beautifuI moment.

269
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,474
Seeing you two friends reconcile,
I could almost cry.

270
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,851
Girls.

271
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:22,965
English
