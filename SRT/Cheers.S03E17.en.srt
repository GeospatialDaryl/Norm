1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,832
BEHlND EVERY GREAT MAN

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,430
Delicious, Sammy. Fortunately,
l've saved room for another.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,792
Gentlemen, the keg is dry.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,599
A new keg coming out, gents.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
We'll miss you.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,874
Do we have to do this every time?

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,918
We don't have to,
it's an honour and a privilege.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,753
The keg is dead. Long live the keg.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,789
Norm? Normie, are you OK?

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,714
Oh, Cliffie, l swore
it wouldn't get to me this time.

11
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,237
l got a letter from Coach. He's in Ohio.

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,073
- Why Ohio?
- Family reunion.

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,676
There's some pictures
of him with everybody.

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,356
- Let me see.
- That's a very attractive family.

15
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,273
But why is everybody
but the Coach black?

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,149
That's not his family.
He was sent an invitation by mistake.

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,869
He didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings
by not showing up.

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,515
Looks like they've accepted him.

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,832
Are you kidding? He's been going
for the last six or seven years.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,595
ln fact, next year
they're going to have it at his place.

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,231
lt says here, ''Send
my love to everybody at Cheers.''

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,153
Then he signs it ''Uncle Whitey''.

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,079
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

24
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,279
- What would you like, Norm?
- A reason to live. Keep them coming.

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,558
- You look a little peaky there, my friend.
- l'll be OK once my dinner settles in.

26
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,395
- You ate at the Hungry Heifer again?
- Yes. The place is all right.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,518
l just didn't order the right thing.

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,319
- l couldn't resist the muscles.
- l love seafood.

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,075
No, he's a big burly waiter,
makes you shut up and eat.

30
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,156
- Va-va-va-voom, eh, Norm?
- l beg your pardon?

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,711
Hot babe at twelve o'clock.
l think it's the next notch on my bedpost.

32
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,637
The only notches on your bedpost come
from banging your head in frustration.

33
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,157
- Coming this way.
- l pity you married guys.

34
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,232
- Hi, l'm Paula Nelson.
- Norm Peterson.

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,628
Hi....

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,279
- This smooth talker is Cliff Clavin.
- Hello, Cliff.

37
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,352
May l buy you
and your immigrant friend a beer?

38
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,557
- Absolutely.
- Two beers, please.

39
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,154
l'm a reporter
for ''Boston Scene'' magazine.

40
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,757
l'm looking for information
on the singles scene in Boston.

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,314
- Have you met many women at Cheers?
- No.

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,789
l haven't had much success,

43
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,953
but how can l compete
with Cary Grant over there?

44
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,868
l notice you're not writing.

45
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,113
Don't waste your time
with these two geldings. Beat it!

46
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,149
Real smooth, Cliffie.

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,710
lt's a good thing
she identified herself as a reporter.

48
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,317
Otherwise, she would be
Doctor Feelgood's next patient.

49
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,075
Cliff, how long did it take you
to create this little world you live in?

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,753
lf you really want the low-down
on the singles scene,

51
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,673
talk to the owner of the bar,
Sam Malone.

52
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,149
He'll give you
all the information you need

53
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,550
and make you breakfast
the next morning.

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,190
l've heard every pick-up line imaginable.

55
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,239
l doubt your Mr Malone has anything
but a quote that would help me.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,868
Well, la-di-dah.

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,711
Hey, good-looking,
what have you got cooking?

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,713
- You must be Sam Malone.
- The one and only.

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,759
- Who are you? Do you like ltalian food?
- l'm Paula Nelson.

60
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,673
Hi, Paula.

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,277
Hi. l'm writing an article on singles bars
for ''Boston Scene'' magazine.

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,557
What is the major allure
of this bar for the singles crowd?

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,678
You're gazing hungrily at him, honey.

64
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,156
You're unbelievable.

65
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,313
- l think he's got a whiff on this one.
- Not in a million years.

66
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,870
Would you say ''Cheers''
is known as a singles bar?

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,318
l'll answer that question seriously
if you'll answer one of mine seriously.

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,879
OK.

69
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,511
Do you think it's possible for a man
to satisfy a woman too much?

70
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,955
ln my two weeks of research,

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,033
you're the first man to hit on me
so relentlessly l've ended the interview.

72
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,078
- You should have come to me first.
- Excuse me.

73
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,674
- You're not leaving, are you?
- Sam, dig it out.

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,149
Come on, you can do it, babe.

75
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,836
You don't really think l meant
those juvenile come-ons, do you?

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,959
- Why wouldn't l?
- Hey, you did! She did!

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,076
No, l was just giving you examples

78
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,238
of the stupid things
guys say here to pick up women.

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,119
- lt's sad.
- Yeah. Well, be that as it may...

80
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,555
Wait. lt'd be fun to help you.

81
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,678
- You're looking for a quote?
- Don't waste my time.

82
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,470
l always say, if it wasn't for people
who say they never go to singles bars,

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,154
singles bars would be out of business.

84
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,276
Didn't Diane say that?

85
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,069
When you talk all the time, you're
bound to say everything eventually.

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,993
- That's almost useable.
- There's more.

87
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,469
Why don't we go up to Melville's?

88
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,156
l'll share my thoughts on singles bars
and we'll have some bouillabaisse.

89
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,437
ls this another come-on?
You're plying me with fish heads?

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,673
No, no, l promise.
We'll just talk about the article. OK?

91
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,150
- l do love bouillabaisse...
- l hear it's an aphrodisiac.

92
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,108
But when l'm around,
even oxygen is an aphrodisiac.

93
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,068
l can't believe you're not writing down
these crude come-ons.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,598
Probably the hardest part of my job
is the daily encounter with loneliness...

95
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
Sammy!

96
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,470
Put it there, Cliffie!

97
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,313
- We're number one!
- Number one!

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,599
Guys? Do you remember anything
Diane said about lmpressionism?

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,070
No, but l know
she makes a bad first one.

100
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,232
- After that, it gets worse.
- Why are you asking, Sam?

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,358
l found out Paula likes
French lmpressionists,

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,159
so l've got to find
some smart things to say.

103
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,675
Yeah, she's an art buff

104
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,832
and l'm a Paula-in-the-buff buff.

105
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,719
Give up on this one, Sammy.

106
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,440
l'm doing fine. We've had two dates,

107
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,876
as long as l keep throwing out
Dianeisms, there's no problem.

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,319
Haven't you had your fill
of dames like that?

109
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,314
l thought that disaster with Diane would
have soured you on brainy women.

110
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,436
Or women. Or life.

111
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,753
- Listen, l want that woman, Carla. OK?
- What's so special about this woman?

112
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,993
Well, if you must know,
it's kind of embarrassing to admit,

113
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,151
but l've never had a reporter before.

114
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,797
- Get out.
- Well, never a magazine reporter...

115
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,795
...from the Boston area...
with a circulation of over a million...

116
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,110
- Yeah, go on.
- ...lately.

117
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,589
What's special about this one?
l don't get it.

118
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,593
l understand it.
He wants the ones he can't have.

119
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,149
Like this dame and me.

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,755
Can't anybody think of something
Diane said about painters?

121
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,115
She's out of your league, Sammy.

122
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,751
Face it, you're just one of us,
one of the great unwashed.

123
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,796
Excuse me, Sam?

124
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,796
l was all too brief in my response
to your inquiry about Cézanne.

125
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,076
Backgrounds were very important to him,
even in his early period.

126
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,438
Eventually however, he completely broke
with Renaissance perspective.

127
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,149
That makes sense.
Thank you very much.

128
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,993
But that's not the reason
his paintings looked,

129
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,711
as you so eloquently put it,
''like he was goofed on skunk weed.''

130
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,515
- You know what l was talking about.
- l'm not putting you down.

131
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,673
l think your new-found interest in the arts
is completely laudable.

132
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,230
And l'd like to think
that l had something to do with it.

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,072
You did.

134
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,549
- Keep it up, big lug.
- Thank you.

135
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,229
Background... lmportant... Renaissance.

136
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,868
A-l-S-S-A-N-C-E...

137
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,237
- Perspective.
- Give up, cucumber brain.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,754
Hey, Sam, you have got a textbook.
What are you asking Diane for?

139
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,593
lt's more fun to steal than study.

140
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,599
Anyway, it's a hot irony to use Diane's
brain to get another woman's body.

141
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,998
l'll be in my office, studying.

142
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,118
Diane, how about those pointillists?

143
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,434
Oh... l think Seurat was the finest
naturalist of his time.

144
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,591
You and me both, sister.

145
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,596
Diane, l'm off to the fetish seminar.

146
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,310
l was hoping for a <i>rapprochement</i>
before l go out of town.

147
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,869
Frasier, l thought l had seen you
at your lowest last night

148
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,032
when you waited until
the kiwi tarts and the demitasse

149
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,397
to announce you were
going to yet another seminar.

150
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,870
This is the most demanding
relationship l've ever been in.

151
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,874
Diane, am l pronouncing this right?
Giv-er-ny?

152
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,838
- Giverny.
- Thank you.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,120
Every time we have a discussion, it
turns into... What was that all about?

154
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,875
Sam is developing an interest
in the lmpressionists.

155
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,634
- Hmm, what?
- Hmm, this is suspicious.

156
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,837
l think it's part of Sam's grand design
to win you back.

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,594
Not this again.
You sound like a broken record.

158
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,799
Now you're saying l repeat myself.
That l say things over and over.

159
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,393
You do repeat yourself on this subject.

160
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,552
And it's very cynical of you
not to believe

161
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,998
that Sam is developing
a genuine appreciation for culture.

162
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,596
l'm sorry, Diane, just one more
art question here.

163
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,593
- What is it, Sam?
- All right. Excuse me.

164
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,716
Now, this Rubens guy.

165
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,111
ls this the same guy
that invented that sandwich?

166
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,794
- No, l don't think so.
- OK. l was just wondering.

167
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,476
The women in his paintings look
like they really tuck away the groceries.

168
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,755
He'll be a curator in no time.

169
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,598
l hate that attitude!

170
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,639
lt's obviously futile
to try to talk to you in this mood.

171
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,756
This is the number to call me,

172
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,549
should you be interested
in rational discourse.

173
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,673
You'll rue the day you did that!

174
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,834
Oh, Frasier!

175
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,871
Diane... Oh, damn.

176
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,476
Carla, do you remember
if Diane said anything about Renoir's

177
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,676
''Bather Seated on a Rock''?

178
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,392
Would you give up on that egghead?
lt didn't work before, it won't now.

179
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,438
l was different before,
this time l'll do it right.

180
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,989
You really think it's worth all this trouble?

181
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,630
Ever since that woman
walked in the door, l've wanted her.

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,712
l won't give up just because
she thinks she's smarter.

183
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,715
- l don't like her.
- That's quite clear, but it won't stop me.

184
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,790
He wants me.

185
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,276
- Hi.
- Hi.

186
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,397
Sam, if there's anything else l can do

187
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,271
to further stimulate and arouse
your interest in the arts, let me know.

188
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,557
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

189
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,918
l'm so moved by your hunger...
for knowledge.

190
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,990
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

191
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,116
Afternoon, everybody.

192
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,280
So how was your meal
at the Hungry Heifer?

193
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,432
Cliff was fussy at first,
but l think l converted him.

194
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,831
- Really?
- Well, yeah, my steak was a little gristly,

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,757
but what do you expect when they've
got a mural of the Heimlich manoeuvre?

196
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,799
Carla, take the bar for a minute,
l have an important call to make.

197
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,793
Cliffie had the Ton O'T-Bone.

198
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,590
For less than four bucks you get
24 ounces of USDA choice beff.

199
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,199
- No, you mean beef.
- Don't be ridiculous, that stuff is beff.

200
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,230
lt's a Hungry Heifer trademark

201
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,712
for a processed, synthetic,
meat-like substance.

202
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,757
- Oh, no.
- What do you expect for four bucks?

203
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,036
See me complain about the loobster?

204
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,951
Hi, this is Sam Malone. You remember
me, do you? Well, that's great.

205
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,078
l'd like to make a reservation
for tomorrow night,

206
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,196
but l want a particular room.

207
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,559
Do you remember l was there with a
slender blonde who was mad about me?

208
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,154
Yeah, l want the same room.

209
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,472
lt had a fireplace
and a deck and a hot tub.

210
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,108
That's it.
l'd like to have that one, please.

211
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,955
Yeah, l'm hoping it'll create
the same old magic.

212
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,351
Yeah. Thank you,
l'll see you tomorrow night. Bye.

213
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,279
Sammy, l hate to cast a shadow
over your good time,

214
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,672
but who will make drinks tomorrow
while you're making whoopee?

215
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,877
Damn. l didn't think about that.

216
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,830
- You can handle the bar, can't you?
- Give up waiting on tables?

217
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,595
l get my heaviest tips
in my third trimester.

218
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,149
You think Diane's ready
to handle this by herself?

219
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,633
What? She's a worse bartender
than she is a waitress.

220
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,156
When you made her do it
for a couple of hours, she hated it.

221
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,073
Well, l'll just have to ask her nice.

222
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,312
- Well, good luck. And good night.
- Yeah, good night.

223
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,031
Well, Sam, l guess l'll be going home,

224
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,239
unless there's something
you'd like to talk to me about,

225
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,949
now we're almost alone
and we have a private moment.

226
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,629
Actually, there is something
l'd like to ask you.

227
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,396
Ask away.

228
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,398
You've been acting
kind of strange today. ls there...?

229
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,632
Well, l've had something on my mind.

230
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,598
Well, yeah, me, too.

231
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,035
This will be pretty tough to ask you.

232
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,239
Sam? lf it makes it any easier,
l know what you're going to ask.

233
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,879
- You do?
- Yes.

234
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,919
l overheard your conversation,
l couldn't help it.

235
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,197
You're going to ask
about this weekend, aren't you?

236
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,195
Yeah, l know the first time we tried this,
it didn't turn out too hot,

237
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,397
but l'll take full responsibility for that.

238
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,750
Well, l'm sure that l was at fault, too.

239
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,710
Whatever. l think the important thing
is that it'll be better this time,

240
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,553
now you know where everything is.

241
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,633
Well, l suppose that's true.

242
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,750
Yeah, l'll tell you what.

243
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,435
lf you like this weekend,
maybe we can make it permanent.

244
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,556
What do you say?

245
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,355
Permanent?

246
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,193
ls that you want, Sam?

247
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,829
l'm not making any promises. Let's just
see how the weekend goes, OK?

248
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,629
- ls three o'clock OK? l already booked.
- l know.

249
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,231
Sam, l'm just overwhelmed.

250
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,437
Oh, come on.
You don't have to be nervous.

251
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,628
After your first few drinks, you'll relax,
and l think you'll actually enjoy it.

252
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,080
Well, it does seem to help.

253
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,792
- Sam!
- What?

254
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,953
Everything's going so fast.
My mind is a tumult.

255
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,908
l feel like we're on a runaway train.
Where will it end?

256
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,877
- l've got to think about this. l'm sorry.
- You really are taking this seriously.

257
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,555
Don't worry, if you break anything,
l'm fully insured.

258
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,753
- Excuse me.
- My fault.

259
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,878
- You take it.
- No, you.

260
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,996
Thank you.

261
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,232
- Nice day for a trip.
- Yes, isn't it?

262
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,755
- Where are you off to, uh...
- Paula.

263
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,638
Diane.

264
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,236
l'm going away with a gentleman
for the weekend.

265
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,995
This is a coincidence, so am l.

266
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,993
- And you're meeting him here?
- Yes.

267
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,953
Me, too.

268
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,833
- Small world, huh?
- Yeah.

269
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,397
lt's my first weekend with this guy and
l just hope l'm not making a big mistake.

270
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,516
He's got me puzzled.

271
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,117
l start to think he's a dumb jerk
and then he says something intelligent.

272
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,834
Well, l'm lucky,
l know mine's a dumb jerk.

273
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,869
But we have something
that just won't die.

274
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,600
Kinda like crab grass.

275
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,672
That's a lovely thought.

276
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,559
l know l may be making
the biggest mistake of my life.

277
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,953
- l'm seeing an eminent psychiatrist.
- So am l. ls it helping you?

278
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,396
- No, l mean romantically.
- Oh.

279
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,475
And l may be giving
all of that up just to rekindle...

280
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,078
...a mostly physical relationship
whose only appeal may be its danger.

281
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,909
- Where are you going with this guy?
- To an inn on the coast of Maine.

282
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,036
This is amazing.

283
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,189
- You don't mean...
- Yes.

284
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,795
- Hey, Paula.
- Sam!

285
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,474
- lt's good to see you.
- You, too.

286
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,758
- Ready for a trip down ecstasy lane?
- Yes, l think so.

287
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,879
- Diane, how are you doing?
- Fine, great, great.

288
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,277
- Really well.
- Will you be all right here by yourself?

289
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,192
You bet.

290
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,114
You two just go off and have nice time.

291
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,236
OK. Thank you.

292
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,030
lf you run into any problem,
Carla knows where to reach me.

293
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,078
- l appreciate this.
- Bye, Diane.

294
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,429
What's with the suitcase?

295
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,195
That's not my suitcase.

296
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,999
Who said it was my suitcase? No, no.

297
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,436
- lt looks like yours.
- There are a million of these around.

298
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,149
No, this one belongs
to this gentleman. Sir?

299
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,875
Really.

300
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,998
Now don't leave this lying around.
Anybody could just walk right off with it.

301
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,515
lt'll never happen again.

302
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,992
- Well, have fun, Sam.
- Yes...

303
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,310
Thank you, l will.

304
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,438
You!

305
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,470
That's the most fun l've had since 1 958.

306
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,715
