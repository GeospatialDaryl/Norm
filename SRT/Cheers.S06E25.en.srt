00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,206
Yeah, it's just                 
a hop, skip                     

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,442
and a jump                      
from the office                 
to the Ginza.

00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,527
    Look who just               
    slithered in.

00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:14,362
    The carpet cobras,

    "The Snake" Drake.          

7
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,268
        SAM:                    
        I'm all right.          
        How are you?            

8
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:22,170
        Rebecca, I've got       
        to use the phone here.  

9
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:24,139
        Oh, you're              
      a phone person, too?      

10
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:25,240
            So am I.            

11
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,775
Isn't it amazing how much       
we have in common?              

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,977
                        Thanks. 

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,712
You know that Drake guy?        

14
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,981
He's probably                   
the kind of bloke               

15
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:37,919
that has his knuckle hair       
removed with electrolysis.      

16
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:39,820
Yeah, he's probably got one     
of those electronic zappers     

17
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:43,324
that he uses to forestall       
his receding hairline.          

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,859
And I bet ya,                   
I bet ya a dime to a donut      

19
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:46,327
that he has his loofa           

20
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:49,997
and he rubs himself raw         
to get rid of his cellulite.    

21
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:54,402
Well, it was in                 

22
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:57,638
 last month's <i>Soldier</i>

      in the world today       

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,683
 Takes everything you've got   

26
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:11,318
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

27
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:14,889
 Sure would help a lot         

28
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:20,761
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

29
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:22,663
   Sometimes you want to go    

30
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:28,036
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

31
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,640
 And they're always glad       
        you came               

32
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,076
         You want to be        
      where you can see        

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,679
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

34
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:43,084
 You want to be where everybody
    knows your name            

35
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,419
         You want to go        
      where people know        

36
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,022
   People are all the same     

37

        Oh!                     

40
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,467
                    Sam, listen.

41
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,901
            Don't you find it   
            interesting         

42
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,503
            that of all the fine
            restaurants         

43
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:19,504
              in Boston to dine,

44
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,706
    that Evans should repeatedly
    dine at Melville's          

45
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,174
                right upstairs  
                from where I can

46
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,376
              be found every day
              of the week?      

47
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,377
No, no.                         

48
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,678
But I do find it                
interesting                     

49
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:28,580
that your button's              
undone there,                   

50
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,416
and your bra has                
a little bow in                 
the middle.                     

51
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
So, uh, what,                   

52
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,423
you think the big guy's         
finally coming around, huh?     

53
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:42,059
No, he's in there               
using my phone.                 

54
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:43,060
Can't you see?                  

55
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:44,896
Since his divorce               
became final,                   

56
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,231
he uses all                     
of his spare time               
to be around me.                

57
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,833
He is in my office              
right now                       

58
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,435
sitting in my chair,            

59
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:53,571
his lips just inches            
from the mouthpiece             

60
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,107
that I use every day.           

61
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:57,842
                You're right.   

62
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,778
                I'm an idiot.   

63
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,680
Excuse me.                      
Rebecca, can we talk?           

64
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,365
Excuse me, Sam.                 
I'm being beckoned.             

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,468
        Listen, if-if this is   
        what you think it is,   

66
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,570
                  can I give you
                  some advice?  

67
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:09,437
What?                           

68
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:10,438
                If you're going 

69
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,406
                to make an ass  
                of yourself,    

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,407
                take it outside.

71
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,342
I'm not going to                
make an ass of myself.          

72
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,410
                    All right.  

73
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,349
I was just getting it           
out of my system.               

74
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,402
You wanted to talk to me,       
        Mr. Drake?              

75
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:27,238
Yes, yes, yes, I do,            
Rebecca.                        

76
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,807
Let's sit down                  
here, okay?                     

77
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,676
Thank you.                      

78
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,446
Well, this conversation         
is long overdue.                

79
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,050
          I couldn't agree more,
          with all my heart.    

80
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,735
      You don't know what       
    I'm going to say.           

81
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,422
                Oh... well,     
                I agree again.  

82
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:48,726
Something... something very     
exciting is happening to me.    

83
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,361
It's going to change            
my whole life.                  

84
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,596
It's a huge risk.               

85
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,881
            Take it! Take it!   

86
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:54,699
I'm moving to Tokyo.            

87
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm going to take over          
the Japanese division.          

88
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:57,651
I leave tonight.                

89
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,588
            Yes, darling, yes!  

90
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:02,523
                ( <i>groans</i> )      

91
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,663
I told her                      
to take that outside.           

92
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,905
I don't believe it.             

93
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,740
Everything was going            
so well.                        

94
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:24,646
Then everything                 
went so black.                  

95
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,980
                Oh, don't worry 
                about it.       

96
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,215
                Women faint     
                all the time.   

97
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,752
              Well, in cartoons,
              they do.          

98
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:35,022
Do you think                    
he noticed?                     

99
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,126
            Yes, yes,           
            I-I think he did.   

100
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,430
                 He, uh, he said
                 that every time
                 he sees you,   

101
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:45,900
            you do something    
            more bizarre than   
            the time before.    

102
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,601
What did you say?               

103
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:49,637
  Well, honey, I had to agree.  

104
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,076
    He is leaving for Japan     
        tonight forever,        

105
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,380
    and I never got to          
      tell him how I feel.      

106
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:00,498
          Well, hey...          

107
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,667
             No, wait. You know,
             listen, why don't  
             you tell him       

108
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:03,701
          at the good-bye party?

109
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,687
      What good-bye party?      

110
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,454
      The one you're gonna      
     throw for him tonight.     

111
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,056
                Listen, it's    
                a great idea.   

112
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,892
            I'll make it a...   
            a Japanese theme.   

113
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,596
          Yeah, yeah, we'll     
          have chips and cheese.

114
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,033
              Sam,              

115
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,868
I will never                    
have Mr. Drake.
