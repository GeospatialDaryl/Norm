00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,970
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,506
Afternoon, everybody.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,807
ALL:
Norm!

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,110
Hey, Mr. P. How's
life in the big city?

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,946
Hey, what'd I tell you
about those fat jokes?

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,817
Uh, what's
in the box there, Norm?

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,719
Only my brand-new
Turbo Flex Airmasters

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,287
with the custom pump fit

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,289
and the night reflector
racing stripe.

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,624
Ah, whoa!

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,192
Ooh, look at that!

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,794
Major shoe.

13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,330
And check out the
reflector, huh?

14
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,166
Wow, shines like
the Northern Lights.

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,668
Yep.

16
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,569
Get this-- they
utilize a patented

17
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,204
ergonomic lever
propulsion design.

18
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,307
Uses your body's own
Achilles tendon as a fulcrum.

19
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,709
<i>I read in Runner's World</i>

20
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,145
that they can improve your
vertical leap by ten percent.

21
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,479
Try 12%, babe.

22
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,214
Ooh.

23
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,451
Ah, that's more than
a shoe there, Normie,
that's a god.

24
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,353
And now, if you
gentlemen will just...

25
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,988
stand back
for a second...

26
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,526
...I'm gonna try
these puppies out.

27
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,663
And we're off!

go over to Gary's, right?

44
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,776
Oh, wait a minute,

45
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,878
wait a minute, you're
going over to Gary's bar?

46
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,579
Well, Sammy,
big heavyweight
fight tonight--

47
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,481
he's got a satellite
dish, you don't.

48
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,117
You're deserting me
for that snake?

49
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,619
You're gonna give money
to the one guy I hate

50
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,953
more than anyone else
in the whole world?

51
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,188
'Course not, Sammy.

52
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,723
I'm gonna run a tab.

53
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,594
Sammy, we wouldn't go anywhere
if you had a satellite dish.
Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,897
All right, all right,
if it means that much to you,

55
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,432
I will look into it, all right?

56
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,034
I, for one, am filled with
a sense of foreboding

57
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,103
when I contemplate the
future of a culture

58
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,238
whose primary
source of recreation

59
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,175
is watching more and
more mindless television.

60
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,643
Don't you agree, Frasier?

61
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,446
Now, why is Gilligan magnetized?

62
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,752
Because he was
struck by lightning.

63
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,455
Every time this episode airs,
you ask that question.

64
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,825
Sam?

65
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,927
Damn it, now, why is Cliff

66
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,863
having his personal mail
sent to my bar?

67
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,099
Well, when you've been harassed
by as many agents

68
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,334
of the government as Cliff has,
you naturally develop

69
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,803
a reluctance to give them
your own return address.

70
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,705
Ah, Cliffie
got a letter

71
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,273
<i>from The Tonight Show
in California.</i>

72
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,876
Is he still trying
to sell jokes
to Johnny Carson?

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,012
When's that poor guy
gonna give up.

74
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,147
He is-- I hear he's leaving
the show at the end of May.

75
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,552
Hey, everybody.

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,388
Hey, Cliffie!
Hey.

77
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,556
Sam, pour me
a cold one, will ya?

78
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,991
It's been a long day.

79
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,860
What's the problem, bub?

80
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,461
Eh, hard to say, I, uh,

81
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,297
just seem to have lost
the spring in my step.

82
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,868
Well, just pull one
out of your head.

83
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,736
Oh, hey, you got
a letter from NBC.

84
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,172
Aw, forget it--
it's just another rejection.

85
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,541
Oh, come on, now,
how do you know that?
Aw, Sammy,

86
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,742
I'm just a plaything

87
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,944
of that fickle maiden
known as Miss Comedy.

88
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:11,417
Last night I went down
to The Laugh Tureen to gig.

89
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,385
Well, they wouldn't
let me go on.

90
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,921
It was amateur night--
they said I wasn't ready.

91
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,157
Cliff, you're not
going to give up.

92
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,092
With the current sorry
state of the world,

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,061
we need your humor
now more than ever.

94
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,862
Well, yeah, thank you
very much, Lilith.

95
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,331
You know, you've always been
my number one fan.

96
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,934
In fact,
you've been my only fan.

97
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,437
(laughing)

98
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,705
(Lilith continues laughing)

99
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,939
I wasn't joking.

100
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,642
Oh. I'm sorry.

101
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,045
It must have been the way you
instinctively time everything.

102
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,880
You can't learn that, you know.

103
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,583
Save your breath.

104
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,552
Nothing's gonna do me any good.

105
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,821
Aw, Cliff, why don't
you just go on back

106
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,589
and lie down
on the pool table.

107
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,092
I think there's
a game going on.

108
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,129
Everybody's a comedian.

109
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,331
Everybody except me.

110
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,900
REBECCA:
Carla,

111
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,469
you hurt him.

112
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,704
Oh, thanks.

113
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,940
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do,

114
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,608
I-I'm just gonna
open this letter.

115
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,076
Maybe it is good news.

116
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,946
I'm just so sick and tired
of everybody in this bar

117
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,514
having such
a negative attitude.

118
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,983
I mean, you know,
good things do happen.

119
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,685
So, did they buy his joke?

120
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,321
<i>(scoffs):
Yeah, what do you think?</i>

121
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,923
"Mr. Clavin,
thank you very much

122
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,692
<i>"for your submission
to The Tonight Show.</i>

123
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,460
"We will not be using
your material.

124
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,129
Enclosed is
your submission."

125
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,697
Hey, what was it this time?

126
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,300
Let me put my beer down--
I don't want it coming
through my nose.

127
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,239
"Today is
Doc Severinsen's birthday.

128
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,142
"You know, Doc is so old,
when he was a kid

129
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,577
"he never blew out candles
on his birthday cake.

130
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,680
They didn't have fire yet."

131
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,948
(laughing)

132
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,251
Lilith!

133
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,987
You can't possibly be laughing
at that terrible joke.

134
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:59,158
You don't find humor
in the exaggeration
of a contemporary man

135
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:03,495
predating an event which
took place 45,000 years ago?

136
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:09,201
Well, had Cliff phrased it
like that, sure, hellzapoppin.

137
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,471
Poor Cliffie. I really
kind of hate to see him
suffering like this.

138
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,839
CARLA:
You know,

139
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:18,177
I think it's about time
we had Cliff put to sleep.

140
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,614
What? He had a lot
of good years.

141
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,085
There is one way
to cheer him up--

142
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,320
you know, we could change
this letter of rejection

143
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,122
to look like
a letter of acceptance.

144
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,825
It'd be pretty easy, actually.

145
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,460
So are you just
gonna dismiss

146
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,694
my putting-him-
to-sleep idea?

147
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:40,399
<i>We're not even
gonna talk about it?</i>

148
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,802
You know, all we have to do is
just white-out the word "not"

149
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,573
and... it looks like,

150
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,377
<i>"we will be using
your submission."</i>

151
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,146
You're pretty good
with that white-out stuff.

152
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,849
Sammy, I used
to be an accountant.

153
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,954
Many is the time this stuff
kept me out of Leavenworth.

154
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,124
I don't know, gentlemen.

155
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,028
Should we really encourage Cliff
in these flights of fancy?

156
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,331
I cite for an example
his Kennedy conspiracy theory.

157
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,066
I, for one,
have never believed

158
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,834
the Beatles were involved.

159
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,173
Give the guy a break.
Okay? For once.

160
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,075
Cliffie! Cliffie come out here.
Yeah?

161
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,877
<i>We opened your letter
from The Tonight Show.</i>

162
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,944
Johnny loves the joke.

163
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,146
They're going
to use it on the show.

164
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,280
Oh, you're kidding.

165
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,649
Read it. Go ahead.

166
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,051
(muttering)

167
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,086
Hey! I did it!
Ha-ha!

168
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,389
I did it! I, uh, I sold
a joke to Johnny Carson!

169
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,891
(laughs)

170
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,293
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life!

171
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,561
Well, take your

172
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,697
last look at Clifford Clavin,
letter carrier.

173
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,166
Yeah, when my joke
hits the airwaves,

174
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,634
I'm gonna start a new career.

175
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,837
Yep, it's going to be
Cliff Clavin, joke meister.

176
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,972
Doctor of Ha-Ha, the funny man.

177
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,841
Yeah,

178
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,009
I'm going to be hanging around

179
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,844
with a whole new group
of friends:

180
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,946
Oscar and Emmy.

181
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,616
Ciao.

182
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,587
Carla, what was your plan again?

183
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,024
Okay, so we tell him
he's getting a flu shot...

184
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,699
Hey, Sammy, look at this.

185
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,468
Here it is right here
in the classified.

186
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,770
You can buy a used
satellite dish

187
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,473
for 300 bucks,
install it yourself.

188
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,042
I don't know anything about
installing a satellite dish.

189
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,710
Oh, come on, Sam,
what's the big deal?

190
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,811
You clamp it to the roof

191
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,646
and you run
a few wires down.

192
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,081
WOODY:
I don't know, Carla.

193
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,117
My Uncle Skyler
tried to do that

194
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,652
with a milking machine right
before an electrical storm.

195
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,623
Cows never forgave him for it.

196
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,559
It was worth it, though.

197
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,961
We had cottage cheese sandwiches

198
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,295
for a month,
I'm telling you.

199
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,500
Hey, everybody.
Guess what.

200
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,734
Cliff Clavin is off

201
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,169
to the entertainment capital
of the world--

202
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,404
the dream factory,

203
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,273
the land of glitz,
glamour and make-believe.

204
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,375
What, you're going
to Chucky Cheese?

205
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,110
No, Woody.

206
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,546
Going to Hollyweird, California.

207
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,114
Yeah, I've got some
nonrefundable

208
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,216
tickets here in my hand; they're
going to take me to Burbank.

209
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,619
And, uh, when Johnny Carson
delights America with my joke,

210
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,021
me and Ma are going to be
sitting there watching it live.

211
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,389
NORM:
You know,

212
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,058
they write an awful
lot of jokes, Cliff.

213
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,026
Uh, just 'cause
they bought yours

214
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,961
doesn't necessarily mean
they're gonna use it.

215
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,632
Aw, geez, Norm, uh,
I'm a little confused here.

216
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,001
I guess you're the one
who is currently employed

217
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,670
<i>as a writer for The Tonight Show
starring Johnny Carson.</i>

218
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,341
You're right, Cliff.

219
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,543
I'm just saying you could
be setting yourself up

220
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,844
for a big fall here.

221
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,379
(laughs):
Norm.

222
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,781
The only question is is whether
Johnny is going to invite me

223
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,883
to sit up there
on the couch next to him.

224
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,218
Oh, hey,

225
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,486
I'd better call Ma.

226
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,620
She'll be thrilled.

227
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,623
You've got to do something, man.

228
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,058
This has gone far enough.

229
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,560
I can't, Sammy.

230
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,095
I'm no good at giving bad news.

231
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,796
Oh, what are you talking about?

232
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,232
You told Vera about losing
all those jobs, right?

233
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,768
I'm gonna get to that,
when the time is right.

234
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,370
All right, I will.

235
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,038
I will. I will.

236
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,407
Uh, oh, boy.
I was right.

237
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,942
She was tickled pink.

238
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,077
Yeah, the two places
she most wants to see

239
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,581
before she goes to the great
beyond is Formosa and Burbank.

240
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,082
Cliffie,

241
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,717
there's something
I have to tell you, buddy.

242
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,052
Oh, wait.
Norm, there's something

243
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,353
I got to tell you first.

244
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,155
Well...
When I was
at the travel agency,

245
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,759
<i>I got, uh, three nonrefundable
tickets to Burbank.</i>

246
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,894
And guess whose name
is on the third one.

247
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,263
Please don't let it
be Norm Peterson.

248
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,265
Norm Peterson!

249
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,101
I'm going to California!

250
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,403
(Norm and Cliff cheering)

251
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,677
♪ ♪

252
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,507
♪ ♪

253
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,727
I love working with
my hands, don't you, Sam?

254
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,129
Yeah, Woody, I do.

255
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:14,233
But not with
any mechanical stuff.

256
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,202
Hey, do you have any idea
how a satellite dish works?

257
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,505
You mean you don't?

258
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,874
Well, to be honest, no.

259
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,243
Well, you've got
a satellite up there.

260
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,911
How far up there?

261
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,682
Oh, about 72 million miles,
give or take a few light years.

262
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,183
And it's got

263
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,987
a gizmo up there so when you
send your TV stuff up there

264
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,090
it shoots it right back
down here to this baby.

265
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:41,760
Boy, you sure know a lot
about the world, Sam.

266
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,264
Oh, Woody, I'm an avid reader.

267
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,901
When you look up there
at all those stars

268
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,569
and all those galaxies...

269
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,674
you realize just how big
this satellite dish really is.

270
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,915
Boy, oh, boy.

271
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,283
This is something,
isn't it, Ma?

272
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,617
Who would have believed it?

273
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,686
There it is, the couch,
the desk and the curtains.

274
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,621
Huh? Huh?

275
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,790
Listen, Cliff, um,
before Johnny

276
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,991
starts his monologue,

277
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,593
there's something I
really want to tell you.

278
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,762
Oh, suddenly it's
Johnny, huh, Norm?

279
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,364
I mean, I work with the man

280
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,099
and I don't even get
to call him Johnny.

281
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,001
Anyway, before he
starts the monologue

282
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,535
I'd like to tell you
something, okay?

283
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,404
Hey, uh, Cliff Clavin.

284
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,538
I'm from Boston.

285
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,474
I, uh, wrote
tonight's monologue.

286
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,641
Really?

287
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,876
Then you know Johnny?

288
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:34,413
Well, does anybody
really know Johnny?

289
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,717
Hey, there's those people
we met in line.

290
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,452
I'm going to go over
and say howdy-do.

291
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,424
Norman, I want to thank you.

292
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,658
For what?

293
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,928
Well, I know Clifford
doesn't have many friends.

294
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,698
I remember that surprise
birthday party I organized

295
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,501
for him and you were
the only one who showed up.

296
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,735
Yeah.

297
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,803
Where were you, anyway?

298
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:01,140
I just forgot.

299
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,076
Mrs. Clavin, I have
a confession to make.

300
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,844
What do you mean?

301
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:09,181
<i>The Tonight Show didn't
really accept Cliff's joke.</i>

302
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,450
I got ahold of the
rejection letter

303
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,720
and I sort of changed it
around to make it look
as if they accepted it.

304
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,722
Oh, my Lord.

305
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,157
I wanted to tell him earlier,

306
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,392
but it's been so long
since I've had a vacation

307
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,860
and Lord knows
I've needed one.

308
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:26,131
Norman, you are a
naughty, naughty boy.

309
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,034
You're his best friend.

311
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,037
You've got to do something
or suffer the consequences.

312
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,640
Okay.

313
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,509
All right, uh, let
me see what I can do.

314
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,649
(clears throat)

315
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,750
Excuse me, buddy.

316
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,118
Uh, could I talk to
you for a minute?

317
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,454
What do you need?

318
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,390
Um, how would you like to
make a couple hundred bucks?

319
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,226
What are you talking about?

320
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,728
A friend of mine
wrote this joke,

321
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,329
and I was wondering
if you could, uh,

322
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,732
sort of slip it into
Johnny Carson's monologue.

323
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,333
Oh, sure,
we do it all the time.

324
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,668
Most of Johnny's jokes

325
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,336
come from folks
just like yourself

326
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,572
in the audience
who offer us money.

327
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,676
I admit it's,
it's a bad joke,

328
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,579
but the guy's entire
existence is riding on this.

329
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,280
This is a bad joke?

330
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,016
I mean a sure clunker?

331
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,018
Johnny will definitely bomb
with this?

332
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,519
I'm afraid so, yeah.

333
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,789
Well, I'm out of work
in a month anyway.

334
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,592
Jay Leno has
his own people.

335
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,693
Let me see the joke.

336
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,229
Oh, great, thank
you so much.

337
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,663
How much can I
give you, huh?

338
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,664
Ah, don't worry about it.

339
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,000
Just buy me a beer
after the show.

340
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,604
Wherever you go,
people are the same.

341
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,809
Well, Woody, I
think we did it.

342
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,577
I think we got
this thing working.

343
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,712
Sam.

344
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah?

345
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,015
You think there's a reason

346
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,985
for all these stars
and all these planets and...

347
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,790
...for all of us being here
where we are?

348
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,726
Yeah, Woody, I do.

349
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,262
Well, would you happen
to know what that reason is?

350
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,598
Come on, man, I'm just proud

351
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,635
of myself for installing
this satellite dish.

352
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,503
Do you think I'm supposed
to marry Kelly, Sam?

353
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,906
I mean, do you think
that's what the plan is for me?

354
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,774
You getting cold feet, buddy?

355
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,277
Well, yeah,
it is a little chilly up here,

356
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,879
but I'm trying
to talk philosophical.

357
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,281
Yeah, I think
you should marry her.

358
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,982
You guys are in love, man.

359
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,250
That's the best.

360
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,919
(sighs)

361
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,655
You know, sometimes I don't
think I'll ever find someone.

362
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,425
I thought Diane was going
to be the one, but...

363
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,027
it turns out
she wasn't.

364
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,096
Which was lucky for me
because if she had been

365
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,264
I just would have
ended up killing her

366
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,967
and dying in the
electric chair.

367
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,206
That is lucky.

368
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,074
And Rebecca.

369
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,110
Well, we wanted to
have a baby together,

370
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,546
but that's no reason to
get serious about anyone.

371
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,784
You know, I used to
think I had it made.

372
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,954
You know, I-I got
my freedom, my bar,

373
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,323
goes without saying
I'm a love machine,

374
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:08,827
but recently, you know,
when I've been alone,

375
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,763
I kind of
feel lonely.

376
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,299
Well, Sam, uh, you know,
Kelly and I are probably going

377
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,403
to have a big,
beautiful house someday

378
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,571
with, uh, you know,

379
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,675
a garden and swimming pool
and lots of servants,

380
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,943
and when you get too old
to take care of yourself,

381
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,445
you can come live
with us.

382
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,614
Aw, that's sweet, man,
but I think I'll...

383
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,516
(chuckling):
...I think I'll
be able to manage.

384
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,423
Would I get
my own room?

385
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:41,760
And now, he-ere's Johnny.

386
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,262
(applause)
Thank you, folks.

387
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,698
Please don't suck up;
I'm leaving everything to Doc.

388
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,666
I don't know if you
know this or not,

389
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,335
but today is
Doc Severinsen's birthday.

390
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,603
(applause)

391
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,107
You really dressed up tonight.

392
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,875
Yeah, a little
something special.

393
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,143
If you think
that's in bad taste,

394
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,245
you ought to see him
in his real birthday suit.

395
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,348
(laughter)

396
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,482
Doc is so old...

397
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,550
Oh, my God,
here it comes.

398
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,452
ALL:
How old is he?

399
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,853
Yes.
...when he
was a kid

400
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,988
he never blew out candles
on a birthday cake.

401
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,023
They didn't have fire yet.

402
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,024
(audience groans)

403
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,926
Ooh,

404
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,861
stay where you are.

405
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,629
Fortunately, folks,
in a situation like this,

406
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,631
the, uh, the band
has instructions to come over

407
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,700
and form a human barrier
in front of a star.

408
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,536
How did that line get
on the cue cards anyway?

409
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,804
I should have done that joke

410
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,440
with one of those big blue dots
covering my face.

411
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:29,875
Who wrote that
joke anyway?

412
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,377
I-I wrote that joke

413
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,711
and it was great.

414
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,713
Pardon me?

415
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,849
The problem wasn't the joke,
the problem was you.

416
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,916
You botched it.

417
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,019
You botched my joke,
Johnny Carson!

418
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:42,955
Sit down, please.
I'm not going to sit down!

419
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:44,089
I wrote that joke.

420
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,391
Get your hands off me.

421
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,926
Is this the way you treat
your talent, Carson?!

422
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,697
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of NBC.

423
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,233
(applause)

424
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,337
Excuse me.

425
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,272
With all due respect,
Mr. Carson,

426
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,675
you didn't tell
my son's joke correctly.

427
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,676
You're his mother?

428
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,777
Yes.

429
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,679
And I want you
to tell it again

430
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,648
and this time
put a little life into it.

431
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,551
Audience, can you stand
to hear this joke again?

432
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,585
(applause)

433
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,591
Doc is so old...

434
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,527
ALL:
How old is he?

435
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,961
...when he was a kid
he never blew out candles

436
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,063
on a birthday cake.

437
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,798
They didn't have fire yet.

438
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,266
(audience groaning)

439
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:31,203
No, no, now tell it again and
this time hit the word "have."

440
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:35,240
And it wouldn't kill you
to turn on the applause sign.

441
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,508
Hit, hit, hit the word "have"?

442
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,543
Have.

443
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,548
Doc is so old...

444
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,717
ALL:
How old is he?

445
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,151
...when he was a kid
he never blew out candles

446
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,319
on a birthday cake.

447
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,387
<i>They didn't have fire yet.</i>

448
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,388
(cheering
and applause)

449
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,901
You see, they heard that joke
three times

450
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,169
and they still laughed.

451
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,905
Now, don't tell me
my son doesn't know comedy.

452
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,140
You-You're a pretty
funny lady yourself.

453
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,509
Would you like
to come down and join me?

454
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,578
Ooh, I'd love that.
(cheering and applause)

455
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,046
Here, hold my purse.

456
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,152
Oh, this is so exciting.

457
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,154
(giggles)

458
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,060
CLIFF:
Oh, yeah, there'll be a
lawsuit, that's for sure.

459
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,695
In a year, this
is going to be

460
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,997
the Clavin
Broadcasting Company.

461
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,966
Yep, his name is
in the computer.

462
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,202
And here's a flash--
he's a postal worker.

463
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,604
I can take your torture.

464
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,506
I'm not scared
of you guys.

465
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,740
(applause over television)
My poor mother's out there.

466
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,875
CARSON:
Thank you very much.

467
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,877
She had to watch
her only son being dragged off.

468
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,879
You've probably broken
that old woman's spirit.

469
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,213
Johnny, I want to give you
a little advice.

470
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,381
Mm-hmm.

471
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,216
When you retire,
get dressed every morning.

472
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,484
You don't want to sit around

473
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,353
all day in your pajamas.

474
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,221
You lose some dignity.
Ah,

475
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,856
thank you, Mrs. Clavin.

476
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,292
Oh, please,
call me Esther.

477
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,195
(whispering):
Ma's with Johnny.

478
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,365
CARSON:
Esther, how did your son get
this joke on in the first place?

479
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,334
A friend of Clifford's
arranged that.

480
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,369
Mm-hmm.
In fact
he's here tonight.

481
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,273
Norman, come on down,
and bring my purse.

482
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,411
(applause and cheering
over television)

483
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,187
Listen, come on,
let's get out of here.

484
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,756
Ah, in a minute,
Norm, in a minute.

485
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,891
Normie, right here...

486
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,326
this is where
Johnny did my joke.

487
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,594
Yeah.
(chuckles)

488
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,529
Yeah... this is probably
just the beginning, though.

489
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,797
I mean, who knows?

490
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,266
You know, Leno may see it,
uh, hire me as a writer,

491
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:45,537
in a few years, retire himself,
name me as his successor.

492
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,906
Come on, Cliffie, let's...
come on.

493
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,408
Go on, I'll meet
you outside.
Come on.

494
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,745
(clears throat)

495
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,846
Ladies and gentlemen,

496
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:57,282
he-ere's Cliffie.

497
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,624
Feels, uh, feels good,
doesn't it?

498
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,259
(breathing heavily)

499
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,561
Sure does, Mr. Carson.

500
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,697
Now, get the hell out of here
before I call security.

501
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:18,170
Esther, does Spago's Restaurant
sound okay?

502
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:21,306
Nobody knows for
sure, Woody, but...

503
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,976
that's what I think
happens when you die.

504
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,213
Well, that's great, Sam,

505
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,917
especially the part about
the Snickers for breakfast.
