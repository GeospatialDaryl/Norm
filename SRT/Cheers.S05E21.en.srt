00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,255
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:09,059
Well, I'm out of here, I guess.

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,561
Going to stop over at the health club.

4
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,065
You belong to a health club?

5
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,567
Yeah, yeah. Vera gave me a
membership for my birthday.

6
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,937
It's, uh, real subtle, huh?

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,188
You-You actually go there and work out?

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,692
Yeah. I try to do, uh, about
25 in the pool every day.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,609
Laps?

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,111
Cannonballs.

Hot dog!

28
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,873
What's up?

29
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,792
They just delivered my new mattress.

30
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,161
Finally, a decent night's rest.

31
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,378
Now all I got to do

32
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,464
is figure out what to
do with my old mattress.

33
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:55,799
Any suggestions?

34
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,751
Well, mine's in the Smithsonian.

35
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,422
Oh, will they send a truck?

36
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,676
SAM: Hey, Frasier!

37
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:07,677
The usual?

38
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,678
Oh, not just yet.

39
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:10,063
I'm meeting a friend for a drink.

40
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,764
Simon Finch-Royce. Mm.

41
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,185
Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, the
n-noted marriage counselor?

42
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,187
No, Dr. Finch-Royce, the circus geek.

43
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,155
Ah.

44
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:20,523
Yes, of course, the marriage counselor.

45
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,742
We were students together
when I was a Rhodes Scholar.

46
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,577
Wow, you were a Rhodes Scholar?

47
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,496
Tell me this:

48
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,498
how come the stuff they
fill in the potholes with

49
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:31,000
is darker than the rest of the road?

50
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,123
I don't know, Woody. I missed that day.

51
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,460
And now it's come back to haunt you.

52
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,846
Sam...

53
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:46,132
Simon Finch-Royce is an
eminent psychotherapist

54
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,384
who specializes in marital relations.

55
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:49,602
Does "eminent"

56
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,888
by any chance mean "rich and single"?

57
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:54,858
Anyway, Sam, I think it's safe to say

58
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:58,111
that he has saved
hundreds, nay, thousands

59
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,445
of troubled marriages.

60
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,316
It's even rumored that he had
a hand in helping Chuck and Di.

61
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,236
Speaking of that, why
don't you upchuck and die?

from school are we... ♪

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,913

66
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,806
Sam, you want me to call the police?

67
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,807
FRASIER: Uh, no...

68
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,309
no cause for alarm, Woody.

69
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,811
Simon and I did the spring
musical together at Oxford.

70
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,763
It was The Mikado.

71
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,265
Simon played Pitti-Sing,
and I was Yum-Yum.

72
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,767
And a handsomer
Yum-Yum I've never seen.

73
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:38,768
It's good to see you, Simon.

74
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:39,769
Uh, how was your flight? All right?

75
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,273
Oh, relatively crash-free.

76
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:44,274
Can I buy you a drink?

77
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,275
Yes, a pint of beer,

78
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,776
but none of that
weak-kneed American bile.

79
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,778
Give me, uh, a little
something with hair on it.

80
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,247
Here I am.

81
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,169
So, uh, you married?

82
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,670
Yes, quite happily.

83
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,673
Too bad. Could've been
my first Englishman.

84
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,676
No, no, no, wait, there
was that one other guy,

85
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,846
but he was so white, I kept
losing him in the sheets.

86
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:10,850
Do we know her?

87
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,352
Yes, that's Carla.

88
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,221
Have her scrubbed and sent to my tent.

89
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,641
Sam, a Guinness for my friend.

90
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,976
Guinness coming right up.

91
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,445
Oh, Simon, by the way:
Sam Malone, Woody Boyd.

92
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,446
Simon Finch-Royce. Hi. Hi.

93
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,698
Howdy. Howdy.

94
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,700
Oh, and, uh, this is Diane Chambers.

95
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,202
Oh, how do you do?

96
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,704
Delighted to make your acquaintance.

97
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,208
You're so much taller than
you looked on your book jacket.

98
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,211
Ah, yes, but you see, the
book's only about that big.

99
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,079
That must be it.

100
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,047
So, what brings you here?

101
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,049
Oh, I'm accepting an honorary degree.

102
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,550
It's nothing much--
just a small college--

103
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,552
but, uh, any excuse
to pop over the pond.

104
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,754
NORM: Doc, uh,

105
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,554
Hi. I'm Norm Peterson.

106
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,555
Oh.

107
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,057
I have to tell you that my wife

108
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,558
is a big fan of yours, sir. Oh.

109
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,559
Yeah, she reads

110
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,061
all those marriage improvement books.

111
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,928
Great. Have they helped?

112
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,846
Well, they've helped me.

113
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,848
It, uh, gives her
something to do in bed.

114
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,850
I have a few questions...
Thank you, Norm.

115
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,736
Shall we just go over here,
where it's a little quieter?

116
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,488
Splendid idea.

117
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,992
Oh, thank you.

118
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,494
Oh, Frasier, please join us.

119
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,862
Oh, Sam, may I have

120
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,247
a seltzer, please?

121
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,115
You know, I had a thought.

122
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,002
Sam and I are about
to be married, and...

123
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,004
dare I ask it, could you be persuaded

124
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:24,007
to possibly have a
session or two with us?

125
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,008
Oh, Diane...

126
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:25,958
I think it's a capital idea.

127
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,344
(Diane giggles) Ah, well, then,

128
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:29,095
let it be my wedding gift to you.

129
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,096
I was considering

130
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,597
the gravy boat, but I think

131
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,966
our relationship
transcends mere crockery.

132
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,769
Are you sure you don't mind?

133
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,771
Oh, not at all. I'm
a terrible workaholic.

134
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,772
And also, it'll be refreshing

135
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,274
to work with a couple

136
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,775
who are not on the brink of disaster.

137
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,777
Thank you, Sam. Will you
excuse us for a minute here?

138
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,279
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

139
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,781
Oh, excuse me.

140
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,782
Why do you want to do this?

141
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,783
We're not in trouble.

142
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,285
We're not even married yet.

143
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,786
Sam, marriage counselors

144
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,289
aren't just for people
who are having troubles.

145
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,292
His expertise will help us lay

146
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,294
a solid foundation for our married life.

147
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,546
(in British accent): Now,
what say we give it a go?

148
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,881
Hey, wh-what's with
this English accent?

149
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,882
Ever since he walked in here,

150
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,384
you-you been talking like the queen

151
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,253
was your Aunt Betty or something.

152
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,922
(with accent): Oh, tosh. What twaddle.

153
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,841
See, th...

154
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,843
Hey, yeah, but, you
know, so, if you Brits

155
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,344
ever find yourself in trouble

156
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,348
against, uh, another major
military power like Argentina,

157
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,318
you know, one thing is, uh,

158
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,320
well, we Yanks'll be
there to bail you out

159
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,689
just like we were during
the last two big ones, huh?

160
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,274
NORM: Cliffie, Cliff!

161
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,692
There's a gentleman over
here that thinks you know

162
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,194
absolutely nothing about photosynthesis.

163
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,696
Oh, yeah, who?

164
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,700
Why... Why, I'll straighten him out.

165
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,584
The first paper that was done...

166
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:44,504
So, Doctor, when shall we begin?

167
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,421
Why not right now?

168
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:47,790
Sure. Is-is there anywhere
with a little privacy?

169
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,008
Well, there's Sam's office.

170
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,426
You don't mind, do you, Sam?

171
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,794
Of course you don't. Lovely.

172
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:55,098
Oh, Simon, Simon, this
is strictly professional.

173
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,099
I want you to bill me for this.

174
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh, right.

175
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,102
Yes. And I do want you
to completely disregard

176
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,603
our years and years of friendship

177
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,604
when determining your fee.

178
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:03,106
Oh, well, whatever you say.

179
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:03,973
Look, I mean it, now.

180
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,475
I-I'll hear nothing of that 40%

181
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,976
psychiatrist's courtesy discount

182
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,478
that's customary here in the States.

183
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:09,979
I wouldn't dream of insulting you.

184
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,484
Well, I'm glad we worked that out.

185
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:17,487
Well, now, uh, where to begin.

186
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,988
Well, usually, at this point,

187
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:19,956
you would tell me

188
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,958
what a loathsome,
contemptible swine he is,

189
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,326
and, uh, you would describe

190
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:27,213
in some detail what a wanton,
libidinous trollop she is...

191
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:29,632
...but as you're only engaged,

192
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,135
we'll just have to look forward to that.

193
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:37,140
When I was on the staff of
the London Psychiatric Hospital

194
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,474
just after my divorce,
we had a couple that...

195
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:39,675
Excuse me.

196
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:40,343
Hmm?

197
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:41,561
You've been divorced?

198
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,395
Yes, I have.

199
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,764
(chuckling): That's great.

200
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,266
Now, Sam, Sam, I can
say to you with pride,

201
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,267
"Yes, I have been divorced,"

202
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,154
because it is only from our failures

203
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,522
that we gain knowledge.

204
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,023
Consequently, I was able to make

205
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:56,275
a much better choice of a second wife.

206
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,610
Perhaps my vision

207
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,030
was clearer for the
tears that I had shed.

208
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,285
You are the wisest man I know.

209
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,541
High praise, indeed. Well, now, uh...

210
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,380
...I need to begin to
get to know you two,

211
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,382
so, Diane, why don't,
why don't you start?

212
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:23,269
Well, they say you don't
have prenatal memories,

213
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,523
but I have a distinct
in-utero recollection

214
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:31,027
of a Fourth of July
concert my mother attended.

215
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,529
There was at least one Souza march...

216
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,898
And then he proposed
to me in, of all places,

217
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,284
a court of law.

218
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:43,406
This time I acquiesced and
agreed to become Mrs. Malone...

219
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:44,957
(snoring quietly)

220
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,127
...which brings us here today.

221
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,914
You know, my wife has a skirt

222
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,716
very similar to the one you're wearing.

223
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,336
(laughs)

224
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,006
Sam...

225
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,008
a little of your history, please.

226
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,511
Oh, right, all right. Okay, uh...

227
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,398
Let's see, uh, it was,
uh, August 5, 1973.

228
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,901
I, uh, got my first major league save.

229
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,853
It was in Baltimore.

230
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,606
Sam, you don't have
to go into all of that.

231
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:17,406
If you can go back to the womb,

232
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,909
I can go back to the
damn Oriole doubleheader.

233
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,829
Anyway, uh...

234
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,780
sweltering day.

235
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,782
Frank Robinson had been
killing me all season,

236
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:28,284
but this day, I'm telling you...

237
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,036
...it happened every single time.

238
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,003
Which means that,

239
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,004
no matter what town you were in,

240
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,291
these women would just hang
around outside your locker room,

241
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,792
I mean, complete strangers,

242
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,294
and-and throw themselves at you?

243
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:39,295
Yeah.

244
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,297
(whispering): It was great.

245
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,301
Well, uh, moving on.

246
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,803
Now, um, what-what are the keys

247
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,805
to a successful marriage?

248
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,307
Well, there are numerous
schools of thought.

249
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,808
Uh, many experts claim

250
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:57,313
that the most important single
ingredient in a marriage is...

251
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,230
Quickly now.

252
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,981
Love?

253
00:09:58,981 --> 00:09:59,699
Sex.

254
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,451
Honesty...

255
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:05,454
because from honesty springs...

256
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:05,955
Fidelity.

257
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,157
Sex.

258
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,910
Yes, trust.

259
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,829
Oh, I was going to say that.

260
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,332
Well, those people are wrong.

261
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,833
Now, during the, uh, course

262
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,335
of my counseling, I have come up

263
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,836
with a number of scenarios,

264
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,839
the responses to which
give very useful pointers

265
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,341
to a couple's compatibility.

266
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,842
So, Sam, we'll start with you.

267
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,645
You're on your honeymoon.

268
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,647
With Diane?

269
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,648
With Diane.

270
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,517
Now, the two of you

271
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,818
are on a tropical beach

272
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,154
wearing nothing but your swimming togs.

273
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:41,657
Uh, Doctor, I do have
a tendency to freckle.

274
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,527
Diane is wearing a big hat.

275
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,664
Now, Sam, you see a woman walk by.

276
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,167
Her flesh is tawny from the tropic sun.

277
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,536
Her proud yet supple
bosoms heave mightily

278
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,005
against the constraints
of her tiny bikini.

279
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,708
You think she is the most beautiful
creature that you have ever seen.

280
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,010
At this moment, Diane
turns to you and says,

281
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,011
"A penny for your thoughts."

282
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,879
Do you share them with her?

283
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,133
Uh, gee, that's, uh, that's hard to say.

284
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,635
Wh-When you say "bikini",
is it that French cut...?

285
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,020
Sam!

286
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,356
I'm just trying to clarify things here.

287
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:17,276
All right, all right,
do I tell her? Um...

288
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,228
No, of course not.

289
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:22,615
You wouldn't trust me to handle that?

290
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,984
Well, yes, of course I would.

291
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,369
Did I say no? I meant yes.

292
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,236
All right.

293
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,538
Diane, it's your wedding night.

294
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:31,490
You and Sam have just made love,

295
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,877
and Sam has not performed
to your satisfaction.

296
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:37,380
(laughing)

297
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,303
He asks you how it was.

298
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,805
Do you tell him?

299
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,175
I never have before.

300
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,509
(chuckling): I'm kidding.

301
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,510
I'm kidding.

302
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,262
I tell you I'm kidding.

303
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,065
Of course I wouldn't tell him.

304
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:56,932
It would hurt his feelings.

305
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,768
Fine. Well, I...

306
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,269
just have to express my appreciation

307
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,104
that you've been so open with me.

308
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,105
I've heard enough.

309
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:03,989
(happy gasp)

310
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,607
That's it?

311
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:05,357
Of course, Sam,

312
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,859
that's all he has to hear.

313
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,360
The good doctor is a brilliant man.

314
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,362
I'm sure he has a complete
handle on our relationship.

315
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,864
Yes, I have.

316
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,365
You two should not only not get married,

317
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,251
you should never see each other again.

318
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:19,922
What?!

319
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,424
Well, I'm sorry to be so blunt,

320
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,926
but sometimes a surgeon
has to cut in order to cure.

321
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,795
Whoa...

322
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,046
what's the problem?

323
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,048
Well, would that there were only one,

324
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,299
but there are so many.

325
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,101
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.

326
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:33,602
SIMON: I mean...

327
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,104
first of all, and most obviously,

328
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:36,605
you have absolutely nothing in common.

329
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,606
Then, on top of that,

330
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,475
you have an appalling
lack of communication.

331
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:42,812
What about the idea
that opposites attract?

332
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,314
Ah, the song of the truly desperate.

333
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:48,317
Well, take it from...

334
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:49,819
take it from one who has observed

335
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,320
dozens of failed
marriages--

336
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,823
the only thing that
opposites attract is divorce.

337
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,324
Well, don't, wait a minute, don't go.

338
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:56,325
What shall we do?

339
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,326
Well, think yourselves lucky.

340
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,211
I mean, you found out now.

341
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,663
Saved yourself years, perhaps decades,

342
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,965
of pain and heartache.

343
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,834
Cheerio.

344
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:13,909
FRASIER: Ah, Simon!

345
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:16,162
Simon, I've signed a blank check.

346
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,446
Now, remember, no favors.

347
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:18,948
I want you to fill in your regular fee.

348
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:19,949
Oh, as you wish. Thanks.

349
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,951
Say, excuse me, I must
dash back to the hotel.

350
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:22,952
Oh, listen, just for my ledger,

351
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:24,453
uh, what amount should I fill in?

352
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:25,337
$1,500.

353
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,256
Fine. $1,500. Done.

354
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,625
Pretentious limey bastard.

355
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,462
Well, what am I saying?

356
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,297
It was your wedding
gift and he is the best.

357
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,132
The man's a quack.

358
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,135
Imagine he had the nerve to say

359
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,887
that Sam and I shouldn't get married.

360
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,557
(in British accent): That we
have absolutely nothing in common.

361
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,858
Excuse me, Diane.

362
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,726
What exactly do you two have in common?

363
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:51,313
Well, we...

364
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:53,649
Wait a minute.

365
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,150
Somebody suggesting

366
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,153
Sam and Diane aren't
right for each other.

367
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,072
Now, where have I heard that be...

368
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,074
Of course. My prayers.

369
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:06,962
What are we gone do?

370
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,964
We're going to get married, of course.

371
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:13,469
We're not going to listen to
that sack of fish 'n' chips.

372
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,890
Wait a minute.

373
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,894
(laughs)

374
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,396
Why, that wily old bird.

375
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,898
He's brilliant.

376
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,900
Hold it, hold it, hold
it, hold it, hold it.

377
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,402
First, he's brilliant,
then he's a quack,

378
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,403
and now he's brilliant again?!

379
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,105
DIANE: Don't you see?

380
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,490
It was a test.

381
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,492
He was testing our resolve

382
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:37,993
in the face of his pronouncement.

383
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:39,995
Come on, let's go to his hotel.

384
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,997
No, I don't want to do that. Come on.

385
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:45,868
Sam, we have to prove to
him that we are indivisible.

386
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:47,670
Oh, I can't believe that I almost fell

387
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,171
for the oldest trick in the book.

388
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,673
(Sam groans) Come on.

389
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,542
Why, I thought the oldest
trick in the book was the one

390
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,345
where the guy tells you
you got a spot on your shirt

391
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,347
and then when you
look down, bud-oom--

392
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,598
flicks you in the nose.

393
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,385
Well, uh, Woody, you do have
a spot on your shirt there.

394
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:05,771
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Clavin.

395
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,273
I'm not falling for that.

396
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,274
I'm much too smart for you.

397
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,642
Wait, no, no, Woody, Woody.

398
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,443
You, you got a spot right there.

399
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,945
Yeah, yeah, right.

400
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,947
You're not gone make
me look like a dope.

401
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,073
No, darling, I've settled
in for the evening.

402
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,874
I'm desperate for a
bit of peace and quiet,

403
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,661
so I'll just have a bite to
eat and a bath and pop into bed.

404
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,797
Oh, that pompous twit
Frasier Crane says hello.

405
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,583
Yes, bad as usual, if not worse.

406
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,387
Still, you may be amused to
know I stuck him for $1,500.

407
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:39,221
(knocking at door)

408
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:40,673
Oh, uh, excuse me, darling.

409
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,674
There's someone at the door.

410
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,675
Shall we say...

411
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,676
Yes, all right.

412
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,478
Yes, I love you, too.

413
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,483
Oh!

414
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,484
Hello, Doctor.

415
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,353
Ah, this is a surprise.

416
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,654
Uh, sorry about this.

417
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,156
We didn't catch you on
the hopper, did we? Uh...

418
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,025
No, but thanks for asking.

419
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:00,909
Come in.

420
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:04,163
This will only take a moment.

421
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,665
You know, you're a very clever man.

422
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,668
It wasn't until after
you'd left that we realized

423
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,671
you were merely testing our resolve.

424
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,673
So we stand before you now

425
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,677
as proof we are steadfast in
our devotion to one another.

426
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,679
Well, that's very lovely,
but it wasn't a test.

427
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,182
Oh, listen to him, Sam.

428
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,184
It's yet another test.

429
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,686
I'm afraid I haven't made
myself sufficiently clear.

430
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,687
Um...

431
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,607
you two are an accident

432
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,360
waiting to marry.

433
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,365
Well, you couldn't be more wrong.

434
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,367
If you only knew the enormous

435
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,868
obstacles we've overcome,

436
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,370
you would know that we are destined

437
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,372
to die in each other's arms.

438
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,874
Because, although we are
very different people,

439
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,378
our parts mesh together perfectly.

440
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,880
We have achieved symbiosis.

441
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,384
Well, not every time, but it's close.

442
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,671
(speaking quietly)

443
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,173
Sorry about this.

444
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,057
Aren't we all?

445
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,815
All I'm saying is maybe he's right.

446
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:14,316
Maybe we should give it some thought.

447
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:15,317
Maybe we should wait.

448
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:16,819
Maybe I'm a confirmed bachelor.

449
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,072
Maybe you'll do me the honor
of sticking a sock in it.

450
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,907
I take it it didn't go so well.

451
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,909
He claims it wasn't a test.

452
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,913
If you ask me, his
methods are highly suspect.

453
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,916
How can he say that we are mismatched

454
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,918
on the basis of two silly questions.

455
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,921
I didn't even answer mine accurately.

456
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,923
I said what I thought he wanted to hear.

457
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,426
Sam, did you answer the
way you wanted to answer

458
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,795
or the way you thought
he wanted you to answer?

459
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,013
Or the way you thought
I wanted you to answer?

460
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,298
I don't know, I got confused

461
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,183
after the babe in the bikini walked by.

462
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,604
Well, Diane,

463
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,556
did you tell Simon all this?

464
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,061
No, I didn't.

465
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,563
But I'm going to now.

466
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:02,564
Come on, Sam.

467
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,066
We just came back from that hotel.

468
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,567
I'm not going back there again.

469
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,320
Sam, this is a crucial
point in our relationship.

470
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,121
Oh, I am starved.

471
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,622
I haven't eaten all day. Come on.

472
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,624
Uh, both of you, go to Finch-Royce.

473
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,625
Tell him the truth.

474
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,993
Let him make an accurate

475
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:15,794
assessment of your relationship.

476
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,162
You owe it to me.

477
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,464
You owe it to him.

478
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,215
And most of all, you
owe it to yourselves.

479
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:22,050
Now don't come back until
you're fully satisfied.

480
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,801
I don't care

481
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,635
how long it takes.

482
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,637
All right, all right. Right. Thank you.

483
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,639
1,500 bucks, my butt.

484
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,641
Frasier Crane can play hardball, too.

485
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,649
If you need anything
else, just let me know.

486
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,650
Oh, thank you.

487
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,153
Now, are you sure the soup
is piping hot this time?

488
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,154
Oh, yes, sir.

489
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,155
I burned myself on the bowl.

490
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,156
Excellent.

491
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,947
(knocking at door)

492
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,332
(sighs)

493
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,039
Ah, how lovely to see you again.

494
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,875
What's it been, 30 minutes?

495
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,677
I'm sorry to barge in.

496
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,678
I hope we're not disturbing you.

497
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,181
Well, actually, I was just
about to have my dinner.

498
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,549
Dinner?

499
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,801
Yes, I mean, uh, I
don't want to sound rude,

500
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,304
but I actually would like
to eat it while it's hot.

501
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:16,805
I'm sorry, but this is simply

502
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,307
too important to put it off.

503
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,808
It's been preying on our minds.

504
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,810
We really can't think of anything else.

505
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,811
Isn't that right, Sam? Yeah, right.

506
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:24,313
Are you gone eat those crackers?

507
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:26,315
Yes, I am. Now, could
you please just say

508
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,316
whatever it is you've come to say?

509
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,817
Very well.

510
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,319
From the moment of your pronouncement,

511
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,321
we felt that you were wrong,

512
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,823
and now we realize why.

513
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,825
We gave you the wrong answers

514
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,827
to your questions about the honeymoon.

515
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,329
We've thought it over

516
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,831
and now we want to give
you our real answers.

517
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,833
Yes, well, it doesn't
matter what you say now.

518
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,335
You see, I mean, what matters

519
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,337
is your first response,
your gut reaction.

520
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,839
I mean, you've had two
hours to think about it now.

521
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,342
Yes, well, sometimes,
it takes Sam two hours

522
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,345
to come up with his first thought.

523
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:00,349
I don't, I don't appreciate that.

524
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:01,850
You know, it was your stupid idea

525
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,851
to come here in the first place.

526
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,853
All of a sudden, he says
something you don't like

527
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,355
and now you, you don't
believe him anymore?

528
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:07,856
DIANE: Well, he's wrong.

529
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,358
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

530
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:10,859
Don't you think he's
capable of making a mistake?

531
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:11,860
That's highly
unlikely--

532
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,363
although I did let the two of you in.

533
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:15,864
Excuse me, um...

534
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:17,866
Come on, let's get
out of here, will you?

535
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,868
I'm starved, I'm gone
go have some dinner.

536
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:20,869
You want to join me?

537
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,254
Please say yes.

538
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,713
(knocking)

539
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,222
Oh, I wondered what was keeping you.

540
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:43,108
I was beginning to get worried.

541
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,776
Did we get you out of the shower?

542
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,562
No, no, no, no, the,
uh, the soup was so hot

543
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:48,814
it set off the sprinkler system.

544
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,618
Sam and I have been to the library

545
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,620
and we've done extensive research.

546
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,989
We're here to tell you that
you are full of rubbish.

547
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,457
How thoughtful.

548
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,461
Most people would only have phoned.

549
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,463
Now, if you'll just examine
the parts that I have marked...

550
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,465
I think I've shown
remarkable restraint so far,

551
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,467
but I have had just
about enough of this.

552
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,468
Now, I've said

553
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:10,919
that you're not compatible

554
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,922
and you have done nothing
to show me otherwise.

555
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,924
Look, I don't know what
we're supposed to do

556
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,427
or what we're supposed
to say, but we're here,

557
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:19,928
fighting for our lives together.

558
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,430
Now doesn't that count for something?

559
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,765
No.

560
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:28,320
Why not?

561
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,322
Well, let me answer you this way: Sam,

562
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,323
do you really want to be here?

563
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,824
No.

564
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,326
Oh, what do you mean "no"?

565
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,194
I mean no. I don't want to be here.

566
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,196
I mean, this whole thing
was your stupid idea.

567
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,198
What do we care if this guy

568
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,199
doesn't think we should get married?

569
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,201
Nobody we know thinks
we should get married.

570
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,205
We don't go bugging them in
the middle of the night, do we?

571
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,707
All right,

572
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,709
what do you suggest we do?

573
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,210
Nothing.

574
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,211
Oh!

575
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,213
That's your solution
to everything: nothing!

576
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,215
Is that what you're going to do

577
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,717
for the rest of your life: nothing?

578
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,218
I haven't decided yet.

579
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,775
I've grown to hate them.

580
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:14,900
(knocking at door)

581
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,746
That's it. I've died and gone to hell.

582
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:32,584
Doctor, there's one thing
you haven't considered.

583
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:36,088
Right. Fine. All right. Okay.

584
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,090
Um, Sam, Diane,

585
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,094
you two are perfect together.

586
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,096
I'm sorry I made a mistake,

587
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,597
but I now see that you are

588
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,984
the most perfectly matched
couple on the face of the earth.

589
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,902
But, why, why am I telling you this?

590
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,905
Let's, let's share it with the
rest of the world, shall we?

591
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,273
Hear this, world,

592
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,076
the rest of you can
stop getting married now!

593
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,945
It's been done to perfection!

594
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,913
Envy them, sofa. Envy them, chair.

595
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,416
For you shall never be as cozy as they.

596
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,918
For I guarantee that their marriage

597
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,921
will be a total
epoch-shattering success.

598
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,924
And I stake my life on it!

599
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,927
Wait, let, let me put that on record.

600
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,432
I, Dr. Simon Finch-Royce,

601
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,300
being of sound mind,

602
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,269
declare that Sam and Diane

603
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,772
shall be together
throughout all eternity,

604
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,773
and if I am wrong,

605
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,275
I hereby promise that
I will take my own life

606
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,278
in the most disgusting manner possible!

607
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,231
Here, take the tape.

608
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,232
No, no, no, no, no!

609
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:38,700
Take the whole machine.

610
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,702
It's my wedding
gift to you--

611
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:42,070
to you, the most perfect couple

612
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,956
since the dawn of time!

613
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,465
See?
