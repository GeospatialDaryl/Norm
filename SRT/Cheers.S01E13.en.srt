1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,434
You know, Sam,
this is my favourite time of day.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,035
What's that, Coach? Closing time?

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,473
No. 1:37. I don't know.
There's just something about it.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,033
I know what you mean.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,755
I suppose we've all got
our favourite 1:37 story.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,155
What's your favourite time of day,
Sam?

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,838
Gee, I don't know. 8:15's nice.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,635
Yeah. I used to like 8:5.
I think I kinda grew out of it.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,512
Wait a minute. Coach, Sammy.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,832
I don't want to be left alone
locked up in this bar all ni...

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,989
<i>Quarter to three</i>

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,195
<i>No one in the place except you and me</i>

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,353
Once in a while, a man
needs a little time to himself.

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,789
- Evening, everybody.
- Hi, Norman.

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,955
Beer?

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,718
Nah, I'd probably just drink it.

17
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,478
What's new, Norm?

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,637
I just came from a late lunch
at the Copley Plaza.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,679
You had lunch at the Copley?

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,270
Yeah. I took a prospective employer
there. Courting the guy.

21
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,915
- What did you have?
- The rack of lamb for two.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,872
Don't remember what he had.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,558
I saw Teddy Kennedy over there.

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,750
Whoa. Norman, really?

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,353
I still say that Kennedy will be
president some day.

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,754
No, wait.

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,348
Maybe even next time.
You know how politicians are.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,197
- Doesn't make sense.
- I really don't think so, Diane.

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,232
I've got a pet little theory
about that.

30
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,716
You see, if you go back in history
and take every president,

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,310
you'll find that the numerical value
of each letter in their last name

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,557
was equally divisible into the year
in which they were elected.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,356
So who's gonna win, Cliff?
Reagan again?

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,230
Mondale?

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,079
No. Not a chance.
See, I figured it out.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,193
By my calculations,
our next president has to be named

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,231
Yelnik Mcwawa.

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,076
That's the stupidest name
I ever heard.

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,431
Sam, please. You're talking
about our next president.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,230
So, Norm. What was Kennedy
doing at the Copley?

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,794
Having lunch. I got his autograph.

42
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,070
You disturbed him during his lunch?

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,714
No. God!

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,229
I waited
till he went to the men's room.

45
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,670
Mart... Martie Broder?
I got the wrong stall. I dunno.

46
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,915
Ho, Cliff.
Isn't that Tibor Svetkovic?

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,911
- Svetkovic, where?
- That's Svetkovic all right.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,874
Based on the fact that he has a long
name that you can all pronounce,

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,513
I guess that he's an athlete.

50
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,158
Or will he be president in 1990?

51
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,034
Diane, the man was Czechoslovakia's
greatest hockey player.

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,228
He defected to us
just to play in the NHL.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,271
It's an incredible story actually.

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,631
He dressed up as a woman,
hid in a haystack,

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,671
crawled on his belly
under barbed wire,

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,110
swam a couple of rivers and stowed
away on a tramp steamer to get here.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,593
Amazing.

58
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,599
The next week, the rest of his team
came over on the Concorde.

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,359
That's what he gets
for not reading his schedule.

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,550
Nobody said
he was a smart hockey player.

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,037
Is this my day, or what? First
Teddy Kennedy now Tibor Svetkovic.

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,469
You better memorise his shoes,
you might want his autograph later.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,758
Tibor, I see you play all the time.
I'm Sam Malone.

64
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,440
Your problem may be
too much caffeine.

65
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,390
Sorry, what?

66
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,671
He's learning English
from TV commercials.

67
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,558
And who are you?

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,873
I'm Lana Marshall.
I'm Tibor's commercial agent.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,275
Is that right?
I'm Sam Malone, the boss here.

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,630
You're the boss?

71
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,591
You're gonna tell me what to do?

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,754
Something tell me
you know what to do.

73
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,438
I know what I like to do.

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,356
That's nice.

75
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,075
I like the lady who knows what she
likes to do and does what she likes.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,749
The mating ritual of
the horny-breasted lounge lizard.

77
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,112
Two beers.

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,912
Let me take care of you two here.

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,716
- Tibor. Miller Time?
- TV! Yes, sir.

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,914
- What can I do for you?
- What's your speciality?

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,235
I do everything the same round here.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,999
- Great.
- Then why don't you surprise me?

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,509
- It would be my pleasure.
- Mine too, I hope.

84
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,154
- I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.

85
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,679
She'll be here,
he'll be back and I'll be sick.

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,635
So, you get jobs for professional
athletes to be in commercials?

87
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,797
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I specialise in male athletes.

88
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,630
Don't you know who you were
just talking to? That's Sam Malone.

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,672
Cute guy. Too bad he has dandruff.

90
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,595
- He used to play with the Red Sox.
- Really?

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,233
Who does he play with now?

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,075
You know,
you give broads a good name.

93
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,116
Excuse me, could I ask you
a question about your boss?

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,595
The king of the single entendre?

95
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,953
Tell me, does he have a wife,
or worse, someone he cares about?

96
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,995
He's available and very desirable,

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,997
if lummox is your cup of tea.

98
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,951
And it appears to be.

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,149
Tibor, I think it's time
to get to the Garden.

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,628
I'm late.

101
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,917
After game, your room?

102
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,679
No, Tibor,
I think I'm going to be busy tonight.

103
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,155
OK, goodbye.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,919
And this concludes
another day of programming.

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,238
Sooner or later,
you'll own General.

106
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,078
Poor guy should really think
about wearing a helmet.

107
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,396
I understand
that you were an athlete.

108
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,192
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

109
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,630
That's all right. I was a relief
pitcher before they became famous.

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,036
- I missed it by a year.
- Have you done any acting?

111
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,916
Well, you know, yeah, I have.
I had the lead in a school play.

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,112
The one about the evil woman
who pushes her husband

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,595
into getting rid of people
for more and more power.

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,233
<i>You mean Macbeth?</i>

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,830
<i>No. How Boots Fooled the King.</i>

116
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,310
<i>- Was that what Macbeth was about?
- Tibor's looking better, isn't he?</i>

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,038
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,789
- Hey, Diane, we're talking here.
- She's talking.

119
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,956
You're killing time between thoughts.

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,513
You got a problem?

121
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,156
Look, Sam. Just watch it, OK?

122
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,669
She's not
one of your usual bimboettes.

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,678
That's what I like about her.
She's got a lot of class.

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,712
While I have never been
a big fan of the women you date,

125
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,559
I will say that at least
they were too stupid to be harmful.

126
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,636
I knew they'd grow on you.

127
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,676
Is there something between you two?

128
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,870
No. That's just business.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,629
I never mix in her personal life
and she mixes in mine.

130
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,870
I've just been talking to my
secretary about the winter schedule.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,276
I think there might be some
commercials you might do very well.

132
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,278
Me? You're kidding.

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,233
No.
You have a very sexy, playful quality

134
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,112
that would come across on camera.

135
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,955
Wait,
I haven't played baseball for years.

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,957
I'm not exactly a household name.

137
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,834
Non-star athletes are in vogue.
They come across as regular people.

138
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,670
What do you say, Sam?

139
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,029
- I gotta think about it a bit.
- Come on, do it. You're a natural.

140
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,118
Look at you. You're tall, handsome,
you got a great smile.

141
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,117
Show her your smile.

142
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,154
I'll be damned.
Who the hell was I thinking of?

143
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,757
You know, I have to admit, all these
years watching those commercials,

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,916
I always thought
I might be pretty good.

145
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,837
Let's do it.

146
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,871
Wonderful.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,434
Look, I'm staying at the Ritz.

148
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,029
Why don't you come over later
and we'll work out the details?

149
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,438
I don't get off until two.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,797
All the better.

151
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,118
All these people at the bar
and no one introduced us.

152
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,270
No, they didn't.

153
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,278
I'd like to thank
each and every one of them.

154
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,673
Me, too.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,719
<i>Now for Fields Light Beer,
former Red Sox pitcher, Luis Tiant.</i>

156
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,469
<i>After the game,
I like to sit back, light up a cigar</i>

157
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,238
<i>and enjoy a Fields Light Beer.</i>

158
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,588
<i>Hey, Luis.
Hey, Sam.</i>

159
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,109
<i>When you get to be my age,</i>

160
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,118
<i>30, you don't want to get filled up.</i>

161
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,673
<i>That's why I drink Field Beer.
It's refreshing, satisfying,</i>

162
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,917
<i>and you don't full feel with Field,
you just full fine.</i>

163
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,548
<i>Full feel with Field, you full fine.</i>

164
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,076
<i>Sorry, Luis, I don't think
you've got it. I'm pulling you out.</i>

165
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,475
<i>- Skipper, let me stay.
- Sorry, big guy.</i>

166
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,472
<i>Go get them, Mayday.</i>

167
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,830
<i>Now pitching, Sam Mayday Malone.</i>

168
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,314
<i>Fields,
it's refreshing, it's satisfying.</i>

169
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,236
<i>You don't feel full with Fields,
you just feel fine.</i>

170
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,713
<i>Alright!</i>

171
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,193
<i>Another save.</i>

172
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,552
<i>I still get the win, don't l?</i>

173
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,872
You were great.

174
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,029
Coach,
two bottles of Fields right here.

175
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,439
Normally I wouldn't use that to
shampoo my dog but you sold me.

176
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,358
Sam, you could sell me
ice cubes in summer.

177
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,710
You're in showbiz now.

178
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,759
You're a star.

179
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,157
Sam, could you introduce me
to Gene Tierney?

180
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,795
- I don't know Gene Tierney, Coach.
- OK, be that way.

181
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,910
Come on. How about a speech
from the big actor?

182
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,237
Yeah, how did it feel
to see yourself up there, Sammy?

183
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,195
It was nice. It was very nice, OK?

184
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,749
I was afraid of this. We have
to sedate the man, he's hysterical.

185
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,031
Sam, if there's anything you wanna
talk about, get off your chest.

186
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,470
There's nothing I wanna talk about.
I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl.

187
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,397
Just wait on some tables.

188
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,710
Fine.

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,230
Sammy, that agent of yours
is hotter than a pistol.

190
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,237
She's really earning
her ten per cent.

191
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,989
Listen, will you just leave me alone?
Please, got that? Leave me alone.

192
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,911
- Sam, let's talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.

193
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,671
It's important.
Come back to the office now.

194
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,030
Sammy's in trouble
with Miss Chambers again.

195
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,913
Sammy's in trouble with Chambers.

196
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,709
What do you want?

197
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,628
Sam, you're obviously unhappy
and everybody just wants to know why.

198
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,035
I'm not unhappy.

199
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,957
- You're not?
- No.

200
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,558
- You're happy with the commercials?
- Yes.

201
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,553
- Think you were good?
- Yes.

202
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,636
- Really?
- Yes.

203
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,393
Well, what is it, then?

204
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,317
Are you happy with the money?

205
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,435
yes.

206
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,475
- Are you happy with the auditions?
- Yes.

207
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,549
- Are you happy with your agent?
- Oh, God!

208
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,190
The Dragon Lady.
Tell me about it.

209
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,914
Why? You wanna hear me
say you were right?

210
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,676
Of course not.

211
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,395
Knowing that and knowing
you know it and are tortured by it

212
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,431
is plenty for this country girl.

213
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,909
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

214
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,918
I do wanna help. Come on, let's talk.

215
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,913
You wanna hear about my relationship
with another woman?

216
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,189
Well,... Maybe...

217
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,991
Maybe I should find a man out there

218
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,032
who's intellectually capable
of helping you.

219
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,949
All right, everybody line up
for the ugliest tongue contest.

220
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,670
Alphabetically by height, over here.

221
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,518
It appears that
all the other intellectuals are busy.

222
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,556
You're sure you wanna hear this?

223
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,240
I'll stop you
before I get the vapours.

224
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,114
You see, my relationship...

225
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,833
Lana and I are a lot friendlier
than most agents and clients.

226
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,829
Friendlier?

227
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,272
You know me. I'm never against
a wild night of friend-making, but...

228
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,078
There's some... Now I feel that I'm
supposed to be friendly on demand.

229
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,637
And you're afraid
she'll stop getting you commercials

230
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,832
if you stop being friendly?

231
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,591
When you play in the bigs like I did,
you get used to attention.

232
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,430
When I stopped playing baseball,
I felt something missing in my life.

233
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,314
I was just hoping that these
commercials would get it back for me.

234
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,795
Sam, Lana gave me a message for you
but I can't remember it.

235
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,319
- Lana's here?
- That's it.

236
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,317
By the way, what are you two doing?
We got a lot of customers out there.

237
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,398
I got a problem.
Diane's helping me talk through it.

238
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,230
Look, Sam, let me tell you something.
You've faced a lot of tough problems.

239
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,796
You always found a solution but
since Sir Isaac Hayes came along...

240
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,678
No offence, Diane,
I love Sir Isaac Hayes,

241
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,475
but since then,
it's been talk, talk, talk.

242
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,830
This is a pretty complicated problem,
Coach.

243
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,512
You see, Sam wants to break up
with Lana, and he knows he should,

244
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,316
but he's afraid that he will
sacrifice his acting career.

245
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,556
- See?
- I don't understand what's going on.

246
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,069
Let me show you something.
Come right down here.

247
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,351
Just, please, come right down
here. Stand right here, Sam.

248
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,631
- Pick that up.
- What do you want me to do that for?

249
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,637
Just pick it up.

250
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,039
Now, get the hell out there and tell
her you're finished with her.

251
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,196
Please tell him
it's more complic...

252
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,117
Out. Hustle.

253
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,071
What do you want me to do?

254
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,997
Hustle. I mean it.

255
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,792
That was wonderful. Somehow,
your instincts just told you...

256
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,674
Button it up, Diane. We got
a lot of people out there. Move it.

257
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,358
Right.

258
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,750
Tell me something, Red.

259
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,790
Are professional athletes better
between the old wamsuttas

260
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,399
than ordinary men?

261
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,635
I've had no experience
with ordinary men.

262
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,638
Me neither, but I'm trying
to work my way up to one.

263
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,109
Believe me, athletes take their pants
off one leg at a time, like anybody.

264
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,630
They take off their pants?

265
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,837
I'm glad you're here. There's
something I want to talk about.

266
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,996
Sam,
what do you think of your commercial?

267
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,510
- It was fine but listen....
- I thought it was wonderful.

268
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,392
I've had lots of calls about you.

269
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,509
- Calls?
- A lot of people saw you.

270
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,392
And they liked what they saw.

271
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,235
One of those calls was an offer
for you, a national commercial.

272
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,716
It's big money,
and they want to fly you to Hawaii.

273
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,400
You're going to do the commercial
with the Osmonds.

274
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,873
The Osmonds.

275
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,836
- The whole family?
- That's right.

276
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,555
- Even little Jimmy?
- Well, we're hoping.

277
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,036
Now, come on.

278
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,556
Wasn't there something
I wanted to say?

279
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,797
Later. We've got
to get some pictures for you.

280
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,638
We should buy a new sports jacket.

281
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,435
Afterwards, we can stop off
at the hotel for a bite.

282
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,039
And a nibble.

283
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,991
And a scratch.

284
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,831
Coach.

285
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,235
Sam, I'm getting real mad now.

286
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,510
- Lana, we can't nibble any more.
- Why?

287
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,909
I just don't feel right about it.

288
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,879
I see.

289
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,598
Does this mean
that you're no longer my agent?

290
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,714
Sam, what kind of person
would I have to be

291
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,479
to drop you as a client
just because of this?

292
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,309
- A dragon lady.
- I'm no dragon lady.

293
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,315
- Good.
- But I am gonna drop you.

294
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,391
I've learned from past experience,

295
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,398
once you've had an intimate
relationship with a client,

296
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,717
you can't go back
to being just business associates.

297
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,308
Perhaps it's time
for me to find a new face.

298
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,833
My face is new.

299
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,554
Good,
you still have time to return it.

300
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,238
She's good, Sam.

301
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,198
- So, that's it?
- Yep.

302
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,154
Good luck in finding a replacement
for me in the Hawaii commercial.

303
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,874
If it takes me
longer than six minutes, I'll quit.

304
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,431
Boy, she is good.

305
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,590
May I ask you a question?

306
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,231
You want to know how he was?

307
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,713
What?

308
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,272
You think I'm gonna stand here

309
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,709
and listen to you tell me
how good Sam was?

310
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,069
Fair?

311
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,913
What do you wanna know?

312
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,349
I want to know
how you can live with yourself.

313
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,598
I can't. That's why I like
having young athletes around.

314
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,473
I've always been crazy about them.

315
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,879
Sometimes when I'm with one, I swear
I can hear the crowd cheering.

316
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,751
I could understand this behaviour
from an oversexed adolescent.

317
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,637
- But you're..
- An older woman? Middle-aged?

318
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,830
All the more reason
to grab some youth.

319
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,753
There was a time in my life when men
would invent tricks and schemes

320
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,154
to get my attention.

321
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
Well, now I'm the one
who schemes to get theirs.

322
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,431
That's not too unfair, is it?

323
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,229
But don't be too concerned.
Someday, even that won't work.

324
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,432
Don't judge me until the bloom
is off your rose, honey. Ta-ta.

325
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,719
She is good.

326
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,639
<i>Fields,
it's refreshing, it's satisfying.</i>

327
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,752
<i>You don't feel full with Fields,
you just feel fine.</i>

328
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,915
<i>Alright!</i>

329
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,068
<i>Another save.</i>

330
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,870
Come on, admit it. I was good.

331
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,556
Come on, say it. I was good.

332
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,875
- You were OK.
- I wasn't OK, I was good.

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,150
What's it gonna do,
kill you to admit it?

334
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,233
All right.

335
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,634
You were...

336
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,515
Good.

337
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,995
Good.

338
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,032
You were OK.

339
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,394
You were good.
And you did the right thing.

340
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,997
Thanks. Hey, listen.

341
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,031
Before you came to work at this bar,

342
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,073
I never thought that much
about morality and integrity.

343
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,912
You made me aware of all that stuff
for the first time.

344
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,549
Thank you, Sam.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'm firing you.
You can leave your apron right there.
