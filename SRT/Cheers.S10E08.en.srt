Doctor Crane, can you help me
with somethin'?

27
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,448
Of course, Woody.

28
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,018
You know, uh,
yesterday was mine

29
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,487
and Kelly's third anniversary
of goin' steady.

30
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,755
And, uh,

31
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,823
I gave her
a dinky keychain,

32
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,127
so she goes and gives me
this $300 camera.

33
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,962
So, my problem is...

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,630
Say no more about
it, Woody.

35
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,732
If I were you, I wouldn't
let Kelly's fine present

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,100
cause you any guilt.

37
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,335
I mean, after
all, she comes

38
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,836
from a very
privileged background

39
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,673
while you're a, an
unsophisticated
working man

40
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,741
who has nary two dimes
to rub together.

41
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,077
You know, these kinds
of relationships

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,146
rarely make it through
a third year.

43
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,149
Actually, I just
wanted to know

44
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,284
how to work
the automatic flash.

45
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:37,289
But now I just want
to go someplace and cry.

46
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,324
Frasier,

47
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,026
I've got to run.

48
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,662
I'm having my photograph taken
for a new I.D. badge

49
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,997
at the lab.

50
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,533
Are you gonna get your
hair done for that?

51
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,868
Why on earth should I?

52
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,305
Well, at least get the tension
on that bun checked.

53
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,041
I mean, if that baby goes,
we're all dead.

54
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,479
That hardly seems just
coming from a woman

55
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,314
whose hair has never
seen a greasy pot

56
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,983
it couldn't
scrub clean.

57
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,419
Watch it, babe!

58
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,520
Ooh, I'm
outta here.

59
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,723
Now, now, girls, girls,

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,391
there's no reason
to insult each other.

61
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,794
No matter how on the nose
either of you might be.

62
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,200
Frasier,

63
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,035
do you think I should
change my hair?

64
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,372
You're asking me?

65
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,340
Just a second, dear.

66
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,377
Uh-oh, I'm in
big trouble.

67
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,878
If I tell her
to change,

68
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,013
she'll assume that
I'm disappointed

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,047
with the way she looks.

70
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,582
On the other hand,

71
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,917
if I say it's fine as it is,
she'll think I don't care.

72
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,085
You know, Lilith,

73
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,487
you should do with

74
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,989
those raven tresses
whatever pleases you.

75
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,225
Because, my angel,
if you're happy, I'm happy.

76
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,159
You're chicken.

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,161
But happy.

78
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,897
For heaven sake,
take a stand!

79
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,732
Just a second, dear.

80
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,835
She's goin' to the
mat on this one.

81
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,738
Why don't you just tell her
to get her hair changed?

82
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,473
Perhaps you're right.

83
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,475
You know, she
probably wants

84
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,477
to change herself in
some way, but, uh,

85
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,546
doesn't have the confidence
to just let go.

86
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,982
Lilith, I think you
should restyle.

87
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,550
You know, to tell the truth,
there is a,

88
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,419
a part of me that would,

89
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,288
would like to see a-a little
change in your appearance.

90
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,723
Why?

91
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,059
Because you've secretly hated
the way I've looked

92
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,961
all these years and haven't
had the guts to tell me?

93
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,165
Just a second, dear.

94
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,003
Taxi!

95
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,240
That's exactly why I
never got married.

96
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,242
Oh, is that why,
Cliff?

97
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,244
Yeah, that's why.

98
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,248
Mornin', everybody.

99
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,383
EVERYONE:
Norm!

100
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,484
Hey, what's goin' on,
Normie?

101
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,119
It's my birthday, Sammy.

102
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,121
Give me a beer, stick
a candle in it.

103
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,557
And I'll blow out
my liver.

104
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,925
Hey, it's his birthday.

105
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,226
Did ya hear that?
EVERYONE:
Happy birthday, Norm!

106
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,561
I just want the day

107
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,496
to come and go
just like any other day.

108
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,932
Uh-huh.
I think
you can pull that off.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,367
Well, Norm, you know,
despite the fact

110
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,202
that you don't want to make
a big fuss out of it,

111
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,437
we all, uh, chipped in
and got ya somethin'.

112
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,106
Now what is it
that, uh,

113
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,108
you want more than anything else
in the world?

114
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,476
Another beer.

115
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,578
CLIFF:
Close your eyes there,
Mr. Peterson.

116
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,951
Yay!
Oh, guys!

117
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,252
Yay!

118
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,221
What could it be?

119
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,856
Let me see.

120
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,290
(gasps)
It's a beer!

121
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,160
Thank you, guys.

122
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,361
Thank you.

123
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,064
Hey, I got you
a very,

124
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,066
very special gift,
my friend.

125
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,300
More special
than a free beer?

126
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,335
Yeah. Come here.

127
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,636
Is it a keg and a snorkel?

128
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,737
(laughs)

129
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,139
Come, stand right here.

130
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,274
Now I know what a big fan
of the Celtics you are, so...

131
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,209
(knocking on door)
here's your present.

132
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,113
(Sam chuckles)

133
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,183
Kevin McHale?

134
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,190
Sammy, I love the guy,

135
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,426
but, uh, I know where
to draw the line, you know?

136
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,327
No, no, no, no,
no, okay,

137
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,662
he's just deliverin' it.
Come on, Kevin.

138
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,464
Norm, Sammy tells me

139
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,999
what a big fan you
are of the team,

140
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,001
so on behalf of myself
and the Celtics,

141
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,703
I'd like you to have
this team jacket.
Oh,

142
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,738
all ri...
Thanks, man.
Happy birthday!

143
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,340
All right!
Have a happy...

144
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,474
Look at this.
Ah, hey.

145
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,909
Hey. Smile.

146
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,510
WOODY:
Hey, whoa, whoa,
smile.

147
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,546
(camera shutter clicks)

148
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,848
Sam, how do you work
the flash on this?

149
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,350
I got my hands full
here, Woody.

150
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,517
Oh!

151
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,853
(glass shattering)

152
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,191
All right!

153
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,226
What a birthday, huh?

154
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,894
A free beer,

155
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,297
a Celtics jacket from
Kevin McHale,

156
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,366
and Sammy wipi''
out my bar tab.
Hey,

157
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,801
whoa, whoa, whoa.

158
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,304
I didn't say anything
about wipin' out a bar tab.

159
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,673
Well, happy
birthday to me.

160
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,642
Hey, Sammy?
Yeah.

161
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,977
I came through with that jacket
for Norm.

162
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,946
Where's that autographed
Red Sox baseball you got for me?

163
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,381
Oh, right, right.
I'll be, I'll be right back.

164
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,648
All right.

165
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,450
Is it almost ready?

166
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,485
Yeah.

167
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,552
How many G's
in Boggs?

168
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,954
Two.

169
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,389
Is that all?

170
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,890
Doesn't look
right.
Shh.

171
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,226
Hey.

172
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,627
All right.

173
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,962
Thank you, Sam.
Let me use

174
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,163
the phone,
all right?
Yeah, anytime. Anytime.

175
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,664
Normie?
Yeah.

176
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,767
Even though I, uh, chipped in
for the beer with the guys,

177
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,969
Mm-hmm.
I also got you a little
special gift.

178
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,370
Yeah? What's that?

179
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,372
Well, uh, I did some
research on the, uh,

180
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,608
historical significance
of birthdays.

181
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,610
Uncovered a lot
of interesting facts

182
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,278
and, uh...

183
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,314
I'm not gonna share 'em
with ya.

184
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,283
Oh, Cliff, man.
Happy birthday,
big guy.

185
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,319
Say, Kevin,

186
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,488
you know, uh, my birthday's
comin' up pretty soon.

187
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,657
Maybe you could come back
and deliver somethin' for me.

188
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,992
Oh, would you like
a jacket, too?

189
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,993
Yeah, right.

190
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,594
A jacket!

191
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:49,101
Well, guys, I feel like I own
a little bit of Celtic history.

192
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,402
Some of my fondest

193
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,771
memories as a boy are going
down to the Garden.

194
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,674
Yeah.
Being in the same building
as all my heroes.

195
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,376
Sittin' there next to my dad

196
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,978
and as he ordered beer
after beer from the vendor,

197
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,647
sayin' to myself,

198
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:05,250
"Someday, someday."

199
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,552
That's great.

200
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,721
Ah, the Garden.

201
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,723
Yes, perhaps
the most famous

202
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,191
playing surface
in all of sports.

203
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,492
Yep.
Well, you know,

204
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,127
it's a little known
fact that that, uh,

205
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,196
parquet floor
is comprised

206
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,232
of 240 individual
squares held down

207
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,534
by 2,860 bolts.
Uh,

208
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,902
you're wrong there.

209
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,804
It's 2,880 bolts.

210
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,073
And I got that from a member
of the bull gang,

211
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,075
the crew that works
the floor.

212
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,643
Well, I'm very sorry,
Norm,

213
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,013
but my source is
unimpeachable.

214
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,047
Yeah? Who's that?

215
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,182
My ma.

216
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,551
Why don't we settle this
right now?

217
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,953
I'll call the Garden
and find out, huh?

218
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,621
Oh, yeah, yeah. Who're
we supposed to talk to,

219
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,690
the guy in charge
of bolts?

220
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,959
We've got McHale here.

221
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,193
Why don't we just ask him.

222
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,528
Kevin?
Yeah.

223
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,397
Uh, tell this guy
how many bolts there are

224
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,731
on the floor of the Garden,
please.

225
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,932
Well, I-I've
never noticed

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,067
any bolts
in that floor.

227
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,535
You know, come
to think of it,

228
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,404
Bird, Parish,
Auerbach,

229
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,205
nobody knows how many bolts
are in that floor, huh?

230
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,407
There's a game
for ya.
Yeah.

231
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,375
Trivia...
Hey, stop,
stop, stop!

232
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,244
Stop it! Just turn around
and run the other way!

233
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,845
What're you
talking about?
Look, Kevin,

234
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,881
I'm warning you
because I love you.

235
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,250
Don't get caught up
in one of those
conversations.

236
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,618
You'll end up
like those guys.

237
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,053
They never leave
those stools.

238
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,489
It's a disease, and they're
tryin' to hook you.

239
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,091
I knew this guy once

240
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,427
who was a respected
psychiatrist.

241
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,929
It's too late
for him,

242
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,898
but you can still
save yourself.

243
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,066
Go on.
Okay, yeah, yeah,

244
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,434
you're... I got a game
in an hour.

245
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,336
Like to talk about those bolts,
you guys, but I gotta run.

246
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,337
(overlapping chatter)

247
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,605
Thank God.

248
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,040
Hey, I'll tell you
what, though.

249
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,475
If you multiply
the number of bolts

250
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,910
by number of squares
in that thing,

251
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,945
you'd be able to find out
how many bolts there were.

252
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,947
Oh Lord, take him now.

253
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,655
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
One minute to go in the game.
Here we go!

254
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,923
The Celtics still have a chance
to tie it up.

255
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,925
Brings the ball up...
Come on, guys.

256
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,593
Frasier...

257
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,965
...I've just come
from the beauty salon.

258
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,400
I asked them
to do something

259
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,968
a little different
with my hair.

260
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,803
Then you actually went
through with it?

261
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,139
My darling, I'm, I'm
all anticipation.

262
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,307
I've never seen
you out,

263
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,143
but with your by-now
trademark chignon.

264
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,146
Thus the change.

265
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,820
What do you think,
Frasier?

266
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,856
It's hard to say.

267
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,101
(laughs)

268
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,738
You're laughing!

269
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,306
(laughing):
I'm sorry, dear.

270
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,641
You're taking it
all the wrong way.

271
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,143
You see, it was just
the initial reaction

272
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,310
of seeing you
different and...

273
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,246
you know, now that I look
at it again, it's...

274
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,581
(laughing)

275
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,749
Stop laughing.

276
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,950
You're hurting my feelings.

277
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,851
I'm sorry.

278
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,787
Your what?

279
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,288
No, no, darling,
please, please.

280
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,956
Look, give me
another chance.

281
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:58,991
Please.

282
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,025
Another chance.

283
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,027
Please!

284
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,029
(laughs)

285
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,868
Ten seconds to go, the Celtics
down by two on their home court.

286
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,870
McHale's got the ball.

287
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,105
He goes up.
Yeah!

288
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,506
He's in the clear.

289
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,675
Oh no! McHale blows the layup!

290
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,843
(game buzzer)

291
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,011
And that's the game.

292
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,179
The Celtics lose.

293
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,815
Cleveland 102, Boston 100.

294
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,616
I've never seen
Kevin play

295
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,951
that poorly before
in my life.

296
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,252
What was he doin''
out there?

297
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,787
I don't know. I mean,
he wasn't even looking'

298
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,755
at the other players.

299
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,156
He was just staring'
at the floor

300
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:31,990
and moving his lips.

301
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,961
I think he was countin''
the bolts on the floor.

302
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,096
No, come on.

303
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,430
He wouldn't do that
in the middle of a game.

304
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,231
Hey, look, they're gonna
interview Kevin.

305
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,499
Here's Glen.

306
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,568
This is Glen Ordway
on the floor of the Garden.

307
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,737
We're gonna see
if we can catch Kevin McHale,

308
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,138
ask him a couple of questions

309
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,140
and find out exactly
what went wrong

310
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,608
out on the floor here tonight.

311
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,276
Uh, here he comes right now.

312
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,679
Uh, Kevin, can I ask you
a couple of questions?

313
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,447
Hundred and nine,
hundred and ten,

314
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,216
hundred and eleven,
hundred and twelve...

315
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,184
Now look what you've done!

316
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,220
You have ruined him!

317
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,422
You've ruined Kevin McHale!

318
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,923
You took
the scoring

319
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,260
machine, one of Boston's
greatest living sports legends

320
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,695
and turned him
into...

321
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,698
one of you!

322
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,804
GUYS (chanting):
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin...

323
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,714
(phone rings)

324
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,749
Cheers.

325
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,917
Yeah, Sammy, this is Kevin.

326
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,485
Hey, Kevin!
Hey, Kevin McHale.

327
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,987
OTHERS:
Hey, Kevin!

328
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,489
Hey, Sammy, boy,
I'm having a rough night.

329
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,725
Yeah, ooh, boy,
we caught the game.

330
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,794
Yeah, you really stunk it up
out there, huh?

331
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,896
Hey, I saw you pitch.

332
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,698
You're not entitled
to an opinion.

333
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,300
You know what it is,
though...

334
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,601
it's those bolts.

335
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,303
I tell you, I can't get them
out of my mind.

336
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,372
You know, I've called the people
all over town,

337
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,940
and no two people seem to have
the same answer.

338
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,975
Sammy, it's driving me crazy.

339
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,911
Kevin, you, you got to take it
easy with this.

340
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,846
I mean, bar trivia can
eat you up, pal.

341
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,048
Kevin, it's not too late!
Get help!

342
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,149
Don't...

343
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,918
Honey, who's that?

344
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,419
Just the guys
down at Cheers.

345
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,922
(sighs)

346
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,300
My motive, of course,
was to please Frasier.

347
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,102
But this evening, after dinner,

348
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,472
he laughed so hard,
cappuccino ran out of his nose.

349
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,809
Rebecca, you're a friend.

350
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,947
Does this permanent make my hair
look utterly ridiculous?

351
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,782
No, not at all.

352
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,684
I think it's
a delightful change.

353
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:39,885
So do I.

354
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,320
Damn that Frasier!

355
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,590
For a moment, he had me
believing I was a laughingstock.

356
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,392
Thank you.

357
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,861
Don't mention it.
What're friends for?

358
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,730
How can you just
stand there,

359
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,933
staring at that hairdo
and not bust a gut laughing?

360
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,903
(voice straining):
No problem.

361
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,174
Hi, everybody!

362
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,409
Hey, Kevin!

363
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,644
FRASIER:
How come you're
not in bed, man?

364
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,579
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

365
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,881
You got a big game tomorrow.

366
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,416
I don't care.

367
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,219
All I care about are
those bolts.

368
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,522
So I ran out and got a set
of blueprints to the Garden.

369
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,024
Find out how many bolts there
are in that floor right now.

370
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,460
Wait a minute. Where'd you get
blueprints this time of night?

371
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,062
Ah, I know somebody
down at City Hall.

372
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,464
Kind of a sports legend
in this town, huh?

373
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,732
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, all right.

374
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,734
Oh, hey, gee, there,
I'm sorry, Kevin,

375
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,102
but these are
the blueprints

376
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,370
for the new Garden
that they're building.

377
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:32,504
No...
Yeah, yeah, you see,

378
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,607
there should be
a mailbox right there.

379
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,476
No, no.

380
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,211
Oh, give me that phone!
I hope the mayor's still up.

381
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,713
Give me that phone.
No, no, no.

382
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,881
I don't think you should do
that, man. Don't do that.

383
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,983
Sammy, I'm telling you
right now, I got to know.

384
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,251
I got to know.
I'm telling you, nothing,

385
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,653
I mean nothing's
going to stop me.

386
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,988
Kevin.

387
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,691
Good night, guys.

388
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,296
You guys should be
ashamed of yourselves.

389
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,764
You're like vampires.

390
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:02,434
Big-butted,
do-nothing vampires.

391
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,070
And, and now you're
trying to make Kevin
one of your recruits.

392
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,605
Well, I say
it's got to stop.

393
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,974
I'm not going to let you
screw up his career.

394
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,509
Oh, come on,
lighten up, will you?

395
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,177
It's just Kevin's getting
a little carried away

396
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,345
with bolts, that's all.

397
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,813
Yeah, sure, Sammy.

398
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,248
Today it's how many bolts
are in the floor.

399
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,916
Tomorrow they'll
have him onto

400
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,885
"If the Brady Bunch
crashes in the Andes,

401
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,221
who's going to eat
who first?"

402
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,925
Well, they'd probably eat
the maid 'cause she ain't kin.

403
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,864
Well, you know,
but if they're smart there,

404
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,833
they'll ask her first how
she should best prepare herself.

405
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:38,704
Stop it!

406
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,838
All right,
so what do we do?

407
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:40,873
Well, we'll go down
to the Garden

408
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,042
and just count the bolts
in the floor,

409
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,244
so we can settle this thing
and get Kevin back on his game.

410
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,445
All right?

411
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,513
Well, how are we going
to get in there, Sam?

412
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,747
Don't they lock
the Garden at night?

413
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,883
Oh, hey, Woody, don't
worry about those locks.

414
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,251
We can get past
any one of them,

415
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,552
with my trusty
Swiss Army Knife.

416
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,220
(chuckles):
Yeah, I got the big one

417
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,123
with the, uh,
tweezer-toothpick combo.

418
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,225
Yeah.
That's a beauty,
Mr. Clavin.

419
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,660
Yeah, thanks, Woody.

420
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,797
Yeah, every soldier in the Swiss
Army owns one of these.

421
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,665
That's why nobody messes
with Switzerland.

422
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,902
Yeah, I'd rather run buck naked
through the neighborhood

423
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,337
than be without this baby.

424
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,672
Why is that always
the other option?

425
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,615
(lights buzzing)

426
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,552
Whoa, ho-ho!

427
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,519
WOODY:
Are they on?

428
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,555
Uh, yeah!

429
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,557
Look at this, huh?

430
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,258
Boston Garden.

431
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,894
I wake up this morning,
thinking my life has no meaning,

432
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,997
and now I'm standing here.

433
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,199
Yeah, it really, really kind
of clears things up,

434
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,600
doesn't it, Norm?

435
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,802
No, I'm still pretty sure
my life has no meaning,

436
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,138
<i>but I'm standing here.</i>

437
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,439
(laughs)

438
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,975
Every part of this place
is special to me.

439
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:50,809
Yeah.

440
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,678
It's sacred.

441
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,747
It's holy,
you know, like a cathedral.

442
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,516
Think I'll rip a seat out

443
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,184
and throw it in the back
of my car, huh?

444
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,153
Hey, wait a minute...
What? What?

445
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,121
Forget that.
What?

446
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,289
Hey, Mr. Clavin,
I have a question.

447
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,624
Yeah, fire
away there.

448
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,093
Well, how can they play hockey
in here-- there's no ice?

449
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,763
Oh, the ice is, uh, right
under the floor there, Woody.

450
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,364
It's under the floor right now?

451
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,365
Absolutely!

452
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,566
Why don't you, uh, pick

453
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,468
one of these things
up, have a look-see?

454
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,237
Here, use my
Swiss Army Knife.

455
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,305
Suppose anyone would mind
if we shot a few hoops?

456
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,740
Hey, where'd you get that?

457
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,642
Out of the trunk of my car since
last time I was at the gym.

458
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,010
Let's run the floor.
All right!

459
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,746
Here we go! Here we go!

460
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,150
(chuckling):
When was the last time
you were at the gym?

461
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,418
I don't know.

462
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,619
I used to go to that
one next door to Cheers.

463
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,354
There's no gym
next door to Cheers.

464
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,288
Yeah, there was.
They tore it down.

465
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,389
They put up
that bookstore.

466
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,657
There's no bookstore
there either.

467
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,726
Oh, they tore that down
and they put the bank there.

468
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,261
The bank's been there
as long as I can remember.

469
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,829
Well, there you go.

470
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,932
WOODY:
Wow!

471
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,967
Well, what have
we here?

472
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,703
Looks like plywood.

473
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,039
Oh, great!
Hey, I can use the saw.

474
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,008
(thumping)

475
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,943
Oh, great,
somebody's coming.

476
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,545
Woody, put, put,
put the floor back.

477
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,146
Come on, let's go.

478
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,951
Woody, come on.
Hurry up.

479
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,088
What a day.

480
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,790
First Sammy gets me
Kevin McHale's jacket.

481
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,159
Then I get to sneak
around the Garden.

482
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,595
Even look at the plywood
under the floor.

483
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,731
Now we're getting chased off
by security guards.

484
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,299
(laughs)

485
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,967
I'm sorry, guys.

486
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,536
I never had a more beautiful day
in my life.

487
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,776
Drinking alone?

488
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:34,847
No. Frasier asked to meet
me to be here today.

489
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,316
He probably wants a few
more boorish laughs

490
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,518
at my hair's expense.

491
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,887
Well, if it's
any consolation to you,

492
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,989
I think that look does
something for you.

493
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,758
Thank you.

494
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,426
I didn't say what.

495
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,331
Lilith?

496
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,367
Uh, please, don't speak.

497
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,836
I've behaved abominably.

498
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,572
You had the courage to try
something different

499
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,107
in order to please me,

500
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,076
and I've repaid you
with mockery,

501
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,711
which is unforgivable.

502
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,648
But I, I hope you can
forgive me because I love you.

503
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,250
And I love your hair.

504
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,486
And no matter how you might
change your outer appearance,

505
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:19,058
you'll always be
the most beautiful woman
in the world to me.

506
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,392
Oh, Frasier!

507
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,439
Thanks, Rebecca.

508
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,174
Oh, I better keep one.

509
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,712
NORM:
There you go.

510
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,881
Yeah, McHale's playing
a little better tonight, huh?

511
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,150
Yeah, of course he is. As soon
as I told him how many bolts

512
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,385
were in the floor, he just
settled right into his game.

513
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,753
Wait a minute. How could
you tell him that?

514
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,254
We never had a chance
to count them.

515
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,558
Well, I just made up a number,
you know.

516
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,426
I figure he'll never know
the difference.

517
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,795
As long as it improves his game,
you know, what's the harm?

518
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,397
Right.

519
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,165
WOODY:
Sam, I have
a question.

520
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,701
Not now, Woody, I'm, uh,
watching the game here.

521
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,936
No, it's
really important.

522
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,637
What?

523
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,107
Well, say a guy removed
the bolts from a piece of floor

524
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,541
in a very
important building.
Uh-huh.

525
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,644
Like, uh, I don't know,
say, the Boston Garden.

526
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,013
And, and say a guard came,

527
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,649
and he didn't have time to put
the bolts back in the floor.

528
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,284
What would happen?

529
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,954
You didn't put the bolts
back in the floor, Woody?

530
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,689
Oh, I knew
you'd catch that.

531
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,692
I should of just been
honest with you, Sam.

532
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,660
What should I do?

533
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,163
Oh, relax, will you, Woody?
For crying out loud,

534
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,965
they got a crew there to check
on everything before the game.

535
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,533
Yeah, I'm sure they just
found the missing bolts

536
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,001
and replaced them.

537
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,337
I mean, even if they don't,
I mean, what are the odds

538
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,639
of somebody hitting that spot
exactly, huh?

539
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,741
TV ANNOUNCER:
Bird passes to McHale.

540
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,476
McHale is in for it,
stops short.

541
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,478
Oh, he's tripped on something!

542
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,713
He's down!

543
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,481
It looks like a piece
of the floor came up.

544
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,551
That hurt just looking at it!

545
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,887
Oh, no!

546
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,522
I really did it
this time.

547
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,824
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't blame yourself, Woody.

548
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,825
It's my fault.

549
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,527
It was my birthday.

550
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,996
I'm the one who got him
all interested in the bolts.

551
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:06,298
No, no, it's me who dragged
us all out here

552
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,033
in the middle of the
night to go count bolts.

553
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,168
It was my fault.

554
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,302
Oh, never would've happened

555
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,639
if I didn't have
my Swiss Army Knife.

556
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:14,840
Guys, it was my fault.

557
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,709
I'm the one who took
the bolts out of the floor.

558
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,011
He's right, you know.

559
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,213
That's true. Why are
we being so hard
on ourselves?

560
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,915
Yeah, you heard him
admit that, didn't you?

561
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,817
You guys, you heard it?

562
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,528
Hey, Kevin, how are you feeling?

563
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,197
Not too good, Woody.

564
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,264
I don't know
what happened out there.

565
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,200
I must look like an idiot.

566
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,202
It was my fault.

567
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,870
How could it be your fault?

568
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:47,239
I'm the clown
that slipped and fell.

569
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,540
You're right.
You were.

570
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,542
You heard him, guys,
let's get out of here.

571
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,277
Listen, we have
a confession
to make, Kevin.

572
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,512
Uh, when we came

573
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,647
over here the other night
to count the bolts,

574
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,249
we kind of got
carried away

575
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,552
and kind of took some of
the bolts out and then...

576
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,722
kind of forgot to
put them back in.

577
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,991
You mean to tell me
this really is your fault?

578
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,593
I'm afraid so.

579
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,627
Boy, that figures.

580
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:11,363
With you guys,
that really figures.

581
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,733
You know, I'll tell you what,
though,

582
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,201
I guess I can't stay
too mad at you

583
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,404
'cause you finally solved
that bolt question, you know.

584
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:22,041
We got another
confession to make.

585
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,743
We kind of never got around
to counting the bolts.

586
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,745
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You trying to tell me,

587
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,247
we still don't know how many
bolts there are in that floor?

588
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,249
Yeah, but what is
the difference, man?
You played a great game.

589
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,850
Yeah, but what
about tomorrow's game?

590
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,589
NORM:
...1,216...

591
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,425
1,217...

592
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,894
McHALE:
No, no, hold on.
I already counted that one.

593
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,632
(sighs)

594
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,435
One...

595
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,503
<i>two... three...</i>
