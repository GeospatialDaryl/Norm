1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,799
PETERSON CRUSOE

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,236
A Bloody Mary for you. Vodka Collins,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,075
and an Old Fashioned,
light on the bitters.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,279
Diane, l think you got it perfect this time.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,034
Every drink wrong.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,916
My God, what is this?

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,675
Does your waitressing stink!

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,718
- My waitressing does not stink.
- lt does, too.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,552
- lt doesn't.
- Does.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,792
lf l put my mind to it,
l could waitress circles around you.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,394
You stink!

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,718
- l smell a wager.
- No, you smell your waitressing.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,918
l challenge you to a waitressing contest.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,674
Whoever gets the most tips
tonight wins.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,799
You're on, sucker.
l'll even give you a ten buck head start.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,635
That's an insult! And thank you.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,234
We'll need a judge to make sure
this contest is conducted fairly.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,709
lt's Sam's bar, he can be judge.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,394
l'm honoured, but wouldn't it be better

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,120
to find someone
who gives a rat's behind?

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,469
- l do, make me the judge.
- We couldn't have a more impartial one.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,997
Thank you, Diane. lf either of you
suspects any wrongdoing,

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,357
come to me and l'll make
an immediate and final decision.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,512
- Do we have any appeal?
- l think you're both cute,

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,558
but that's not going to
affect my decision.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,959
Get ready for the good times.
The big guy doth approach.

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,519
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm?

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,636
Norman?

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,511
Why don't you sit down, Norm?

30
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,068
What's the problem?

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,994
You know that job l landed
over in Braintree?

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,910
l had to take a company physical
this afternoon

33
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,913
and there was something
on the chest X-ray.

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,039
- Something bad, Normie?
- No, a happy face.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,632
Sorry, Coach. Yes, something bad.
A spot of some sort.

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,679
They sent it over to a specialist
to take a look.

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,197
Come on, Norm,
these things happen sometimes

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,676
and they turn out to be nothing,
They come to nothing.

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,798
Yeah, we all come to nothing, Sam.

40
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,349
l'm just going to get there a little sooner.

41
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,469
Norman, you're jumping to conclusions.
Now stop being so morbid.

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,469
Ever since l heard this news,
all l can think of

43
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,315
is how l may be coming to the end
of my life with nothing to show for it.

44
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,191
You've got all of us, your friends.
We're going to be with you all the way.

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,956
We're going to have to have the surgery
and everything, Diane?

46
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,350
l'm not saying l won't do it!

47
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,997
- l'll explain it later, Coach.
- Everybody says, ''l'll explain it later.''

48
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,948
Cheers. Oh, hi. Yeah.

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,119
Norm, it's Vera.
She needs to talk to you right away.

50
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,794
She's heard from the doctor.

51
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,350
Hi, honey.

52
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,115
Yeah, that's what l figured.
So what did he say?

53
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,953
That's the greatest news.
l can't believe it.

54
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,395
Yes, we do have
something to celebrate.

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,680
So what are you going to do?
That sounds good.

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,752
l don't know what l'll do,
but l can't think about it now,

57
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,595
l have a lot of other things on my mind.
l'll talk to you later, honey.

58
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,228
A flaw on the X-ray.

59
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,394
- Let me buy you a drink, Normie.
- No, not right now, Cliff.

60
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,790
Right now l'm going to take a little walk

61
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,875
with a gentleman l haven't paid
attention to lately... Norm Peterson.

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,795
- l think l understand.
- l don't, but l'm sure you'll tell me later.

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,750
Carla, counting the ten buck
head start you gave Diane,

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,550
you're still ahead nine dollars.
And you've got only one minute to go.

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,996
Yeah, but Diane gave me
a good contest.

66
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,869
l mean, she hustled
what passes for her buns off tonight.

67
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,352
- Good. So you won't rub her nose in it?
- To the bone.

68
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,509
Thank you very much, and a happy
fiftieth wedding anniversary to you both.

69
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,355
- Fiftieth anniversary!
- They had a bottle of Dom Perignon.

70
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,399
l thought they were just
a couple of cheap old coots!

71
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,516
Coach, a twenty dollar tip.

72
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,117
- That's it! Diane wins it!
- Really?

73
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,915
This is so exciting!

74
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,038
Yeah, who's going to sleep tonight?

75
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,433
Don't hurt me!

76
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,071
l didn't mean to gloat, Carla. l'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.

77
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,238
l just wanted to shake your hand,

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,838
but if you don't want to shake my hand,
l'll just say congratulations.

79
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,437
Sometimes there is no pleasure
in conquest.

80
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,876
l haven't forgotten
our first night together either.

81
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,111
- Did you find Norm?
- Yeah, is he weirding out.

82
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,636
- What do you mean?
- l found him sitting in a garden.

83
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,950
He said he wanted to smell the roses.

84
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,873
- l don't think that's weird.
- lt was a vegetable garden.

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,033
That's weird.

86
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,557
Yeah, l said that. He said, ''So l want to
smell the squash. Leave me alone.''

87
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,154
Then he wandered on towards the pier.

88
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,517
l shudder to think
what he wants to smell down there.

89
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,912
This is that bar l was telling you about.

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,475
These people sit here night after night,
wasting their lives away.

91
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,393
But don't hate them. Pity them, as l do.

92
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,511
They're chained here,
unable to soar free like you and me.

93
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,990
Soar, little guy, soar.

94
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,750
You want to have a beer or something?

95
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,230
No time for that.
l just stopped in to say goodbye.

96
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,391
l'm sailing for Bora Bora.

97
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,719
Bora Bora?

98
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,838
Ever since l was a boy,
the South Pacific has called,

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,390
''Come to me, Norm.
This is where you belong.''

100
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,676
l've always ignored that call, till now.

101
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,752
So l'm going to go to the beach
and build a hut,

102
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,718
send for Vera,
and live there the rest of our lives.

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,791
lsn't that nice?

104
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,794
l booked passage on one of those
cargo ships where you work light duties.

105
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,030
We shove off at midnight, so...

106
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,510
Wait a minute. What about a passport?
What about shots?

107
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,636
l already have my passport.

108
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,236
You don't need shots
for Bora Bora, there's no disease there.

109
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,834
Lunacy is on its way.

110
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,429
Norm? What about
that great new job you got?

111
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,194
l should really call that guy, shouldn't l?

112
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,476
Sam, you see what he's doing, right?

113
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,677
The old jokemeister,
tugging at our ankles?

114
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,035
Hold onto your socks,
here he goes.

115
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,190
Hi, Mr Feldman, sir?
Hi, Norm Peterson here.

116
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,590
Awfully sorry to wake you, sir.

117
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,194
l'm not coming to work tomorrow.

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,999
l'm sailing to Bora Bora
to live in a hut.

119
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
Yeah, as a matter of fact, l am in a bar.

120
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,598
No, my head's quite clear, sir.
l'm quitting.

121
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,112
Yes, l realise l'm burning my bridges,
but there's no hard feelings on this end.

122
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,670
ln fact, if you're ever in Bora Bora,
stop by the Peterson hut

123
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,674
and we'll share a cup of grog, sir.
Maybe l'll take you out...

124
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,718
Right, l realise it's late, sir. Very sorry.

125
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,228
l pity that man.

126
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,272
Sammy, l want you to give these
to some poor soul who may need them.

127
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,314
Well, everybody, this is goodbye.

128
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,315
l don't know what to say to you folks.
You've been like family to me.

129
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,076
- l'm going to miss you all, that's for sure.
- Come on, man, this is nuts.

130
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,789
People don't drop everything
and sail away to Bora Bora.

131
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,435
- l do.
- Goodbye, Normie.

132
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,275
Coach, you'll feel silly
when he pulls the plug on this gag.

133
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,070
- You understand, don't you, Coach?
- No, Normie, but they'll tell me later.

134
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,236
You better get used to that.
They got all-male crews on those ships.

135
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,272
OK, Norm, joke's over.
Knock it off. lt's ended.

136
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,157
Norm...

137
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,152
You kidder.
Boy, you had us going there for a while.

138
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,073
Wingtips are for accountants, Cliffie. l'm
a beachcomber now.

139
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,632
Normie's gone.

140
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,592
Here you are.
The service was excellent.

141
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,039
That was nothing. You should have
seen me in the old days.

142
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,350
l was something then.

143
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,278
l'm telling you, people would come from
miles away to see me schlep drinks.

144
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,510
That was before...

145
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,319
The Troubles.

146
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,793
She should be over this by now, it's
been weeks. l robbed her zest for life.

147
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,076
You do have that effect on people.

148
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,632
Sam, we got another letter from Normie.

149
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,399
Oh, good. Norm letter here, everybody.

150
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,471
OK, let me see here.

151
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,077
He says he's found the beach
he was looking for and he's built a hut.

152
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,360
Wait, listen to this, ''l'll send for Vera
when l've built hers, ha ha!

153
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,829
''Whoops, l've lost my hammer, ha ha!''

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,913
- He put the ''ha ha's'' in.
- Good thing.

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,830
''Every morning, a native girl
leaves a coconut outside my door.

156
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,878
''l'm a little shaky
on the local tribal customs,

157
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,160
''so either we're married or l'm going to
be sacrificed next Tuesday, ha ha!''

158
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,949
He sure knows
where to put those ''ha ha's''.

159
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,837
'' <i>Prhi,</i> or goodbye. Norm.''

160
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,072
lt took a great deal of courage
for Norman to do what he did.

161
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,236
l admire and envy him. He has heeded
Thoreau who admonished us that, quote,

162
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,032
''Life is frittered away by detail.
Simplify, simplify.''

163
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,152
Why didn't he just say one 'simplify'?

164
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,753
Let me see the old postmark there,
Sammy.

165
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,792
Yep, she's valid, all right.

166
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,316
Looks like our Normie
made it to paradise.

167
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,754
Yeah.

168
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,798
Two Scotch rocks, Coach. No hurry.

169
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,396
l'll wait till the good waitress
gets her order.

170
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,997
Carla, you are the better waitress.
lt's been proven time and time again.

171
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,197
What does it matter who won
that meaningless contest?

172
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,033
lt matters.

173
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,636
What would it take
to make you feel better?

174
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,438
- Hearing you admit that you cheated.
- Carla, l didn't cheat.

175
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,114
Would it kill you to say you did?

176
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,309
- l did not cheat.
- Two words to restore my will to live.

177
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,311
lt doesn't seem like that much to ask.

178
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,910
OK, Carla, l cheated.

179
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,757
You cheated? Why?
That contest meant that much to you?

180
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,912
You are a very sick woman.

181
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,834
Does anybody in this bar realise
how sick this woman is?

182
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,675
- She cheated on that silly little contest.
- l did not cheat!

183
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,150
First she says she cheated,
then she says she didn't.

184
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,153
What are we supposed to believe?

185
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,237
- The things people do for their egos.
- Yeah, cheating on a silly contest.

186
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,996
l could go around explaining
to everyone what happened,

187
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,391
but l know that l did not cheat
and that's enough.

188
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,111
- l'll just let it drop.
- l'll be in my office if you need me.

189
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,473
l did not cheat! We had this contest...

190
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,354
- Evening, Sammy.
- Hey, Norm.

191
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,678
Norm?

192
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,556
Why aren't you in Bora Bora?

193
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,431
Funniest thing.

194
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,555
l chickened out,
just like everybody said l would.

195
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,154
Never even got on the damn boat.

196
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,272
These are getting stale, though.
Got any beer nuts?

197
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,238
You... you've been hiding in here?

198
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,709
Just for a week.

199
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,394
- Why?
- You kidding?

200
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,554
l made such a jackass out of myself,
l'd be a laughing stock if l went out there.

201
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,272
- So you plan to stay in here forever?
- Yeah, is that a problem?

202
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,075
The way l figure it, you can let me in in
the morning when you come to work,

203
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,515
and when everyone goes home,
let me out.

204
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,989
Just like l always did.

205
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,313
''Just like l always did.''

206
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,155
You get a bar stool, right?
Set it up nice and close like this.

207
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,916
Every now and then you slip me a beer.
Come on, it'll be just like it used to be!

208
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,992
Come on. l know how you feel, man.

209
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,395
You had a crazy dream, announced it
to everybody and you didn't live up to it.

210
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,189
But these people love you. Their are your friends.
They don't care.

211
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,954
Come on.

212
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,874
All right, all right.

213
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,318
lt probably meant more to me
than it does to them anyway.

214
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,996
Maybe you ought to...

215
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,952
A toast to the man the natives are
probably calling the Great Tanned Beast.

216
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,033
An inspiration to us all,
Norm Peterson!

217
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,510
The sofa opens out into a bed, and...

218
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,393
- Laundry day is...?
- Tuesday.

219
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,588
l have never cheated
on anything in my life.

220
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,117
The integrity of Diane Chambers
remains unblemished.

221
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,589
Could we chat for just a second?

222
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,398
Trust me. These people
are your friends. Just listen.

223
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,032
Another toast. To Paul Gauguin, Robert
Louis Stevenson and Norm Peterson.

224
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,156
Three men cut from the same cloth,

225
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,232
only they had to use
a few more yards for Norm.

226
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,598
Yeah, Norm is quite a guy, isn't he?

227
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,877
l don't think he had to sail
to the South Pacific

228
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,032
to make us admire and respect him.

229
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,349
He did for me.

230
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,674
lt was the only worthwhile thing
he ever did in an otherwise wasted life.

231
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,516
l'm serious.
lf Norm hadn't gone to Bora Bora,

232
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,832
l don't think we would have thought
any the less of him. Do you?

233
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,150
- Of course we would.
- Definitely.

234
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,835
- Sam, what are you talking about?
- lt's hypothetical.

235
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,278
Just suppose that Norm had spent
the last three weeks in a motel,

236
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,117
and that he gave those letters to some
guy to mail when he got to the islands,

237
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,113
we wouldn't think any the less of him.

238
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,989
- That yellow belly is in your office!
- Don't be silly.

239
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,470
lf he's not,
he's not going to mind me doing this.

240
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,154
Swell friends l have. That's
the last you'll see of Norm Peterson.

241
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,949
Yellow belly, you've got
a lot of guts showing your face here!

242
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,351
Lay off, will you?
The guy feels terrible.

243
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,035
Yeah?
Yeah, welcome back, buddy.

244
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,909
He's afraid that you will laugh at him
because he chickened out.

245
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,992
Norman? Everyone has had a dream
that they let slip away.

246
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,833
Yeah, but not one everyone knew about.

247
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,357
- Would you like to know about mine?
- Not particularly. No.

248
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,117
When l was a child,
l wanted to be a ballerina.

249
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,272
l had...

250
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,270
l had years of private lessons,

251
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,831
but when the time finally came
to audition for the Juilliard School,

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,551
with my first step
l fell down and bloodied my nose.

253
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,599
And before l could do anything else,
they said, ''Thank you very much.''

254
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,469
- l never heard from them again.
- Thank you very much.

255
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,470
OK, Diane, very good, dear. Thank you.

256
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,590
Norm, do you want to hear
a crazy, hopeless dream?

257
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,833
l wanted to play baseball
and maybe coach a little.

258
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,037
And then afterwards
tend a bar in a nice place.

259
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,156
Look what happened to me.

260
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,909
Coach, that's exactly
what happened to you.

261
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,470
Oh, yeah.
No wonder l'm such a happy guy.

262
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,036
Good try, Coach, good try.
Norm, has any of this helped you?

263
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,555
Yeah, l'm doing a jig in here, Sam.

264
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,676
Go away!

265
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,270
All right, Sammy, clear the decks.
lt's up to me.

266
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,795
Normie, it's your best buddy.

267
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,996
Go away, Frank.

268
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,436
Even in pain he can make us smile.

269
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,474
Norm? You know it's Cliffie.

270
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,279
And l, too, once had a dream, Norm.

271
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,673
No, more than a dream, really.
lt was an all-consuming passion.

272
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:45,154
- l wanted to be a trapeze artist.
- Trapeze artist? Like in a circus?

273
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,073
No, like in your finer restaurants, Sam.

274
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,119
When l was a lad l saw ''Trapeze''
with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis.

275
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,670
No kidding, Cliffie.
Did you sit between them?

276
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,988
l must have seen it 20 times.

277
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,233
l always imagined myself up there
with them, high above the centre ring.

278
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,279
The spotlight shines upon me,
sweat glistens from my body.

279
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,989
Below me the women's eyes
glaze over with lust,

280
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,675
the men grind their teeth with envy.

281
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,673
l lunge at the bar
with almost an insane daring.

282
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,631
l fly through the air completing, one, two,
three, oh, my God, four somersaults.

283
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,190
The first quadruple in the history
of the big top, Norm!

284
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,477
But, l became a postal carrier
and the rest is history.

285
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,270
No, Norm, having a dream isn't stupid.
lt's not having them that's stupid.

286
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,275
What's stupid is the picture of you
in one of those outfits.

287
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,588
Stop laughing at my pal here, all right?

288
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,469
This man had the only dream
that was more ridiculous than mine.

289
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,715
- Yeah?
- A lot more, l might add.

290
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,111
ls that right, Marco Rollo?

291
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
l've got to buy a drink here
for the great Cliffini.

292
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,669
The next round is on me
for Ferdinand Magelly-belly.

293
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,914
- Listen to the Flying Rear-enda here.
- ls that right, Christopher Colum-butt?

294
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,875
English ( en)
