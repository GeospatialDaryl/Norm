1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:05,321
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:08,158
Hey, what're you doing there, Norm?

3
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:10,160
Oh, Vera signed me up to give a speech

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,661
at her Women's Auxiliary Club.

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,662
(laughs)

6
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:14,164
I hate public speaking.

7
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,665
Yeah, you're not alone there, pal.

8
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:17,167
Well, it's awful, you know.

9
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,168
You're standing there

10
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:20,170
in front of a group
of total strangers...

11
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,672
palms sweating, your throat dry,

12
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,674
your mouth feels like
it's full of cotton.

13
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,042
your knees practically buckling.

14
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,011
It can be a miserable
experience. I tell you.

15
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,012
So what's the topic?

16
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:32,015
"Poise: The Key to Success."

17
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,437

Thanks, Mom. Yeah, don't worry about it.

33
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,174
I'll find somebody to sit for the kids.

34
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,042
Bye.

35
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,426
She can't do it?

36
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:51,795
She's scared to.

37
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,098
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh, watch
the kids for you, Carla.

38
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,600
It's not fair. This always happens to me

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,102
when I have a date on a weeknight.

40
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,603
Oh, who's the lucky guy?

41
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:01,471
My butcher.

42
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,939
Oh, yeah? What happened to Eddie?

43
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,357
Eddie's in Vancouver.

44
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,359
My butcher's three blocks down.

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,610
Life is short.

46
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,231
I wouldn't mind, uh, looking
after your kids for you, Carla.

47
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,116
What am I gonna do now?

48
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,236
Well, I'd do it, but
I'm working on Wednesday.

49
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,070
Yeah.

50
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,571
Yeah, Vera and I would love to,

51
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,073
but, uh, we have this
thing Wednesday night.

52
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,374
Yeah, uh, Diane and I

53
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,543
have a thing, too. Yeah.

54
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,911
Maybe it's the same thing.

55
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,796
I don't think so. Probably not.

56
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,584
CLIFF: Oh, I'm, uh,
I'm not busy Wednesday.

57
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,087
Well, guess I'm gonna
have to cancel my date.

58
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,093
Well, is this a day to press
in your memory books or what?

59
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,846
Well, you guys sound pretty chipper.

60
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,147
Shall I tell them, Lilith?

61
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,649
Out with it, or I'm liable
to burst with anticipation.

62
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:47,517
(laughs)

63
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,488
Doctors Sternin and Crane
are proud to announce

64
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:55,358
that they are now officially POSSLQ's.

65
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,193
(Frasier chuckles)

66
00:02:57,193 --> 00:03:00,663
It means "Persons of the Opposite
Sex Sharing Living Quarters."

67
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:01,531
Yes.

68
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,499
Oh.

69
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,002
You see, it's a little, uh,
lovers' in-joke we picked up

70
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,370
from a Census Bureau acronym.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,205
Oh, I love those.

72
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,709
Well, man, hey, that's great.

73
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,711
Congratulations. Yes, yes.

74
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,712
Thank you.

75
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:17,680
But this is... quite a surprise.

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,432
You've only known each
other a few months,

77
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,217
and you're moving in together?

78
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,469
That's pretty impetuous.

79
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,389
Well, a week ago, we decided to
take a chance on cohabitation,

80
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,892
but we waited a week
before announcing the news,

81
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:29,893
so as to avoid

82
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:31,311
putting any undue pressure

83
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,196
on the success or
failure of the endeavor.

84
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,982
And now we are pleased
to announce the effort

85
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,367
a limited success.

86
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,539
Yes, pretty darn impetuous.

87
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,408
Well, we thought that the two of you

88
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,910
were responsible for Lilith and I

89
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,412
finding each other in
this cockeyed world,

90
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,414
so, we, uh, we thought
we'd like to have you

91
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:54,417
over for dinner on Wednesday
night as our very first guests.

92
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,919
Aw. Why, we'd be honored.

93
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,420
Yeah, I'll be there.

94
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,388
Great. We'll get away

95
00:03:58,388 --> 00:03:59,889
from the hurly-burly of this place

96
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,758
and concentrate completely on
the lost art of conversation.

97
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,593
Hmm. I'll be there anyway.

98
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:05,895
All right,

99
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,897
Wednesday night it is
then. Oh, uh, shall we say,

100
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:09,399
oh, uh, what...

101
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,266
8:00-ish?

102
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,651
Wonderful.

103
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,654
You don't know how happy this makes me.

104
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,442
So, you and Diane have this
thing Wednesday night, huh?

105
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,327
Well, why don't you
just come out and say it?

106
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,113
You don't want to spend an
evening alone with my kids.

107
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:27,917
BOTH: We don't want to spend
an evening alone with your kids.

108
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,787
Neither do I.

109
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,789
But what choice do I have?

110
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:33,756
Well... Carla,

111
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:37,627
I think Cliff might be
interested in watching them.

112
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,095
Hey, hey,

113
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,596
what are you doing Wednesday night?

114
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,098
Pumping iron.

115
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:48,604
Okay, Cliff, you're up.

116
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,107
Be at my house Wednesday at 6:00.

117
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,109
But remember, you asked for it.

118
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,610
(chuckles)

119
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,611
Here, come here. Here...

120
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,614
obviously, she doesn't think
that I can handle the kids, huh?

121
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:01,617
Yeah, but my guess is that,
uh, they'll settle down once

122
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:04,120
they're confronted with a
strong male authority figure.

123
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,622
Are you bringing your mom?

124
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,512
I'm home, sweet potato.

125
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,733
Just a moment, cinnamon bear.

126
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,539
How was your day?

127
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,042
Oh, I want to take you now, by the dip.

128
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,044
You impulsive man.
We have guests coming.

129
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,045
Yes, I know.

130
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,546
It'll be our little joke on them.

131
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,048
Every time they say the word "dip,"

132
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,050
we'll become giddy with remembrance.

133
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:10,553
The word itself will
become a syllable filled

134
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,555
with our overwhelming passion.

135
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:15,558
Dear, you're using sex
to express your aggression

136
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,561
toward the confines of polite society.

137
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,562
Dip.

138
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:20,446
I love that.

139
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:28,287
What is that heavenly aroma
coming from the kitchen?

140
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,288
Dinner.

141
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,290
Oh, yes, of course, dinner.

142
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,292
Well, I'm sorry I'm
late, by the way. I got...

143
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,794
No explanation is necessary.

144
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,796
I know you far too well
to have expected you

145
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,797
to be on time tonight.

146
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,798
Oh, right.

147
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,917
Why is that?

148
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,218
Because I've learned that

149
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,719
a certain self-centered insensitivity

150
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,222
is a fundamental part of
your psychological makeup.

151
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,224
And it only endears you to me.

152
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,228
I'm so glad you shared that with me.

153
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,732
Of course you can't
know everything about me.

154
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,734
I mean, who would have thought
that I'd enjoy living with you,

155
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,736
but here we are.

156
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,738
You didn't expect to
enjoy living with me?

157
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:04,740
Well, you do have a...

158
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,242
uncompromising quality.

159
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,243
Mm.

160
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,745
A very attractive one it is, though.

161
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,747
Well, if you were hesitant, why do it?

162
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,250
That's the way you
arranged it, isn't it?

163
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,751
It was your idea.

164
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,003
Ah, yes, well,

165
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,287
you see, you're forgetting the, uh,

166
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,790
passive-aggressive trick you
have of leading someone else

167
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,291
into doing something
that you want to do,

168
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,543
thereby absolving yourself

169
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,844
of responsibility.

170
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,847
And very adorable it is,
too, my little parsnip.

171
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,854
Why do you insist on
displaying your magazines

172
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,106
in that insipid accordion design?

173
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,363
I'm sorry if this one little
touch of theatrical flair

174
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,365
is too much for your retentive nature.

175
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,236
We'll go into my retentive nature later.

176
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,621
For now, we have guests coming.

177
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,122
You know, I see what
you're trying to do here.

178
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,624
You want me to begin the
argument that you wish

179
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,125
you could start yourself.

180
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,126
Well, I will not do it.

181
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:59,629
If you want to have an
altercation, you will have to...

182
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,497
How could you be late
on a night like this?!

183
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:03,966
Didn't you know I'd be
nervous making my first dinner

184
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,469
in your house while your
stupid friends are looking at me

185
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,720
and judging my every move?

186
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,056
I'll never forgive you for this!

187
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,308
Never, never, never, never!

188
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:15,011
(doorbell chimes)

189
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,815
Just a minute!

190
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,318
Darling, I think that
was a real breakthrough.

191
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,822
So come out of the
bathroom, and after dinner,

192
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:28,324
we'll build on it.

193
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,826
But, our-our guests are here now.

194
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:31,827
Dear heart?

195
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:32,828
(doorbell chimes)

196
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,330
Darling.

197
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,333
Coming! Coming!

198
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,041
Hi! Come in, come in!

199
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,042
I hope we're not early.

200
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,544
Oh, no, no, no, your
timing is just perfect.

201
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,545
Oh.

202
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,514
Boy, am I hungry.

203
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:52,515
Sam.

204
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,516
Well, I am.

205
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,519
So, where's your lovely POSSLQ?

206
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,021
Oh, she's around somewhere.

207
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,473
Peach blossom?

208
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,476
Don't make yourself too beautiful.

209
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,478
I can hardly stand to look at you now.

210
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,485
(softly): Come on...
please come out, darling.

211
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,986
Please.

212
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,488
(louder): What was that?

213
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,989
Oh, uh...

214
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,874
got something stuck in her contact lens.

215
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:20,293
Oh, I hate that. Yeah.

216
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,161
Li-Listen, here, come sit down, relax.

217
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,963
Uh, pour yourself some wine, whatever.

218
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,965
Just, uh, make yourselves comfortable.

219
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,217
Oh, oh, Diane, could you hand
me that cheese knife, please?

220
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,004
Thank you.

221
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,507
Uh, enjoy. I'll be right back.

222
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,343
(lock rattling)

223
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,852
FRASIER: What do you
think you're doing?!

224
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,988
LILITH: Might I have a little privacy?

225
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,273
FRASIER: We can resolve all this later,

226
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,775
but for now, these people may
be my friends, but they are not

227
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,777
the greatest
conversationalists in the world,

228
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,112
and I could use your help.

229
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:01,417
Good chips.

230
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,539
Lilith. Ah.

231
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,791
Welcome to our home.

232
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,014
I am so happy for the both of you.

233
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,349
Yeah, absolutely. Congratulations.

234
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,850
Yeah, that's great.

235
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,724
(loud crunch)

236
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,062
Love what you've done
with this place, man.

237
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,314
DIANE: Oh, yes, I love

238
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,115
the masculine touches.

239
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,284
Thank you.

240
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,409
Say, that, uh, that dip looks good.

241
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,710
DIANE: Mmm.

242
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,798
Dip?

243
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,633
Yeah, the, uh, the dip.

244
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,134
Could you, uh, pass it, please?

245
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:54,503
(chuckling): Yes, of course.

246
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:56,756
Be my guest. Here you are.

247
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,257
Oh, thank you.

248
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,678
Oh...

249
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:04,397
Oh, yeah, that is great dip.

250
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,815
Mmm, here. Yeah, try it.

251
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,683
DIANE: Mmm, delicious, Lilith.

252
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,069
Frasier, have you tried
some of Lilith's dip?

253
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:17,360
Yes, I-I have, yes.

254
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,416
Well, then I don't have
to tell you how good it is.

255
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,784
DIANE: Mmm.

256
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,285
It's quite good.

257
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,171
Well, I don't mean to hog it here.

258
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,673
Uh, you guys look hungry.

259
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:31,674
He-Help yourself.

260
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,441
So, Frasier,

261
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,110
was it good for you, too?

262
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,236
What the hell's in this dip?

263
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,743
Well...

264
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,246
may I propose a toast?

265
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:11,747
Mmm!

266
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,749
To your house.

267
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:14,750
Our house.

268
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,634
Hear, hear.

269
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,086
Yes. (Frasier laughs)

270
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,088
(playing piano) ? Our house ?

271
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,589
Oh, I love that.

272
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,092
♪ Is a very, very, very fine house ♪

273
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:25,094
♪ With two cats in the yard ♪

274
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:28,097
♪ Life used to be so hard ♪

275
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:33,486
♪ Now everything is easy 'cause of you ♪

276
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,771
♪ And our... ♪

277
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,773
♪ Our house ♪

278
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,776
(Diane singing along): ? Is a
very, very, very fine house ?

279
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,446
♪ With two cats in the yard ♪

280
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,030
(singing alone): ? Life
used to be so hard ?

281
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,199
? Now... ? Et cetera, et cetera.

282
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,340
You know what I love
about your relationship?

283
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,342
No.

284
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,348
You never seem to have
an unexpressed thought.

285
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,716
I've noticed that.

286
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,771
How do you maintain
that level of honesty?

287
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,139
Well, it's simple.

288
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,025
Frasier and I keep no
secrets from each other.

289
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,193
Oh, come on.

290
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:14,977
You don't mean to tell me

291
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:16,479
you tell each other everything.

292
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,480
Certainly. Exactly.

293
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,865
We've bared our souls to each other.

294
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,201
Oh, now no guy's going to
tell his brand-new girlfriend

295
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,202
about all the women he...

296
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,455
You know.

297
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:28,741
Oh, but there must be
no secrets in that area.

298
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,243
That's where honesty counts most.

299
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,745
Gee, you know, I-I'm afraid

300
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,246
I don't think that's such a good idea.

301
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,665
You mean the two of
you, planning marriage,

302
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,667
haven't already had this discussion?

303
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,668
Of course we have.

304
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,170
Well, Diane's told
us about both of hers,

305
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,173
and we're just about up to the
Johnson Administration on mine.

306
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:49,979
Uh, seriously, though, um,

307
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:54,984
I-I think that we're all
entitled to our little secrets.

308
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:55,985
Why?

309
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:57,486
They only lead to embarrassment

310
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,488
when they're inevitably revealed.

311
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,856
Exactly.

312
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,358
I know I feel better

313
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,360
knowing that Frasier has told you

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,744
he and I were once engaged,

315
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,079
so I don't have to worry

316
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,500
about you discovering it
at some inopportune moment.

317
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,710
Like now, for instance.

318
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,387
Dear...

319
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,390
dear, I thought I told you
that Diane and I used to date.

320
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,891
LILITH: Date, yes.

321
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,393
That you had decided to marry

322
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,395
and spend the rest of
your life with her, no.

323
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,780
Semantics.

324
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,033
And why were you afraid
to tell me that one detail?

325
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,034
Because she still means

326
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,535
something to you, doesn't she?

327
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,037
She means absolutely nothing to me.

328
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,539
I mean, if I notice her at all,
it's merely as an annoyance,

329
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,908
like a bug flying around in a room.

330
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,877
FRASIER: Diane, Diane, be a dear.

331
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,379
Would you grab me the
cheese knife, please?

332
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,665
Frasier,

333
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,050
I'm sorry this happened,

334
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,053
but I think it would
be best for everyone

335
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,921
if you told her the truth.

336
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,756
Diane's right.

337
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,015
All right, all right.

338
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,517
Darling, I'm going to tell you

339
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,519
the whole truth.

340
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,521
(latch rattling)

341
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,916
Out with it.

342
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,419
All right, uh,

343
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:41,924
Diane and I were engaged
to be married and...

344
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,426
she left me at the altar.

345
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,765
The whole experience
was so... humiliating,

346
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:53,769
I-I-I've just been trying
to forget it ever since.

347
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,722
Your feelings for her were genuine?

348
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,108
Yes.

349
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,360
And it's only on account of her action

350
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,362
that you're not married to her

351
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,780
at this very moment?

352
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,282
Well, I-I never really
looked at it that way.

353
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,784
And if Sam were out of the picture,

354
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,285
you'd throw me over and run
back to her, wouldn't you?

355
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,286
I don't love her anymore.

356
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,287
You switch your passions

357
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,789
on and off very quickly, Dr. Crane.

358
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:14,289
I do not!

359
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,791
Then you do still love her!

360
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,659
Well, I never did!

361
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,960
You were going to marry her!

362
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,461
Well, maybe I just thought I loved her!

363
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,463
How do I know you don't
just think you love me?

364
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:22,464
Well, I don't.

365
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:23,966
I mean, I-I
didn't... I-I never...

366
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,469
I will not be grilled
like a common criminal!

367
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:36,512
Cheese knife?

368
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:45,020
All right, thank you very much. Bye.

369
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,022
Ordering another round for
the corner table, honey.

370
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,524
All right, Corinne.

371
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,909
Now listen, uh, thanks a lot
for subbin' on such short notice.

372
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,661
Hey, this is my life.

373
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,664
It shouldn't, uh, it
shouldn't be so bad.

374
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,666
You know, it's not really
very crowded tonight.

375
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,168
That's what you said the last time.

376
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,669
When I got home,

377
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,172
my can was dragging
this far off the ground.

378
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:08,677
Thanks for sharing
that with us, Corinne.

379
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,964
Well, that was Carla's daughter.

380
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,465
She said that, uh, the kids

381
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,467
are going to drop off Mr. Clavin.

382
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,970
All right. All right.

383
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,973
I don't think her kids
are old enough to drive.

384
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,474
(tires screeching)

385
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,476
What was that?

386
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,894
(pained grunting)

387
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:29,314
(tires screeching, car speeding away)

388
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,316
Cliff! Cliff!

389
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,318
Cliff, Cliff buddy, are you all right?

390
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,320
(Cliff mumbling)

391
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,325
Wait, there's a note.

392
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,827
(muffled shouting)

393
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,829
"Don't open until Christmas."

394
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,330
Aw, shoot.

395
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,832
(muffled shouting)

396
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,471
DIANE: Now look here,
Lilith, you needn't worry

397
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,340
about Frasier carrying a torch for me.

398
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,259
I assure you

399
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,061
he feels nothing but
resentment toward me.

400
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,063
He knows I was using him

401
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:04,933
to forget the real
love I felt, and feel,

402
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,268
for Sam here.

403
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,271
Is there any more Chex Mix?

404
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,777
You see, Sam is my real love.

405
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:18,997
I'm ashamed to say that Frasier

406
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,501
was a convenient dalliance on my part,

407
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,920
at a time when I needed someone,

408
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,921
anyone.

409
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,923
I'm sorry it was him.

410
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,926
So, essentially, Frasier was a toy

411
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:34,429
you played with briefly
and then threw away.

412
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,432
Well, it wasn't that bad.

413
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,934
A fellow human being,

414
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:41,937
whose emotions you twisted
for your own satisfaction,

415
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:44,439
with no consideration for his feelings.

416
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,942
Frasier had some fun.

417
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:50,946
We would speak nothing
but French on Sundays.

418
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:01,456
I heard it all.

419
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,458
How could I have been so blind?

420
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,961
Don't blame yourself.

421
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,462
That's right.

422
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:09,965
You can't blame anyone
in these situations.

423
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,333
He can blame you.

424
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,338
Now look here.

425
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:19,842
Our relationship was a two-way street.

426
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:21,844
Yes, and I was run
over in both directions.

427
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,265
Oh, Frasier, you had fun.

428
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,267
Diane, I never had a whit of fun,

429
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,769
especially on Sundays.

430
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,271
And the only thing more egregious

431
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,273
than your French
pronunciation is your syntax.

432
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,028
(door closes)

433
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,496
(bell rings)

434
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:42,998
Dinner, everyone. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

435
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,249
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

436
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,085
Come on, this whole thing
has gone on too far here.

437
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,087
Hey, listen up.

438
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,591
This is what happens
when you open old wounds.

439
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,876
I mean, I don't know

440
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,928
what happened between Frasier and Diane,

441
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,930
but it seems to me
they had a little fun,

442
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,299
but they just weren't
right for each other.

443
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,217
But now that they've found somebody

444
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,218
that, uh, is right for them,

445
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,721
I-I think you both should
be happy for each other.

446
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,723
And leave it at that.

447
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,110
(door opens)

448
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,113
Oh.

449
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,619
Je regrette, mes amis.

450
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,620
I'm sorry, too, Diane.

451
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,121
I don't know what came over me.

452
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,123
Diane, can you forgive me?

453
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,626
Oh, I'm the one who's sorry.

454
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,128
And happy for both of you.

455
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,630
Thank you.

456
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,131
And thank you, Sam.

457
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,634
Yes. Mmm, well, I just
thought it went on long enough.

458
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,003
Besides, I-I have to
use the bathroom here.

459
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,395
Would anyone like some more lasagna?

460
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:47,763
DIANE: No, thank you.

461
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,064
I think we've had our fill.

462
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:52,067
Fine, then I'll just get the coffee.

463
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:55,938
Lasagna?

464
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:58,323
I wasn't even thinking Italian.

465
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,242
Well, I was closest.

466
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,744
I said something with meat.

467
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,246
LILITH: That will be all then, Jill.

468
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:06,498
You can come by and
clean up in the morning.

469
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,916
JILL: Thank you, Dr. Sternin.

470
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,420
You mean you had someone back there

471
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,921
helping you with this?

472
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,423
With the side dishes, yes.

473
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,925
But at the risk of sounding immodest,

474
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,928
I have to take credit
for the lasagna myself.

475
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,346
Oh, well.

476
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,348
DIANE: Well, bravo.

477
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,852
Well, shall we adjourn
to the living room

478
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:27,853
for some coffee?

479
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,354
DIANE: Nice.

480
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,858
Oh, may I propose another toast?

481
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,360
Why stop at seven? Hah.

482
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,364
Well,

483
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,868
we have all learned a
valuable lesson this evening.

484
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,370
We shouldn't be frightened of the past,

485
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,872
or of any affairs

486
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,740
our lovers have had. Indeed,

487
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:52,160
we should be grateful
for those past experiences

488
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,162
because they've made him or her

489
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,664
the person we love today.

490
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,666
Hear, hear.

491
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,667
Well said.

492
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,169
Oh, hey, let me, uh, fill some
of these wine glasses here.

493
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,059
Good night, Dr. Sternin.

494
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,310
LILITH: Good night.

495
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,812
Oh, Sam Malone!

496
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:13,181
Oh, you beautiful man!

497
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,517
JILL: Where have you
been keeping yourself?

498
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,519
Hey, Jill, how the hell you been, huh?

499
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,022
Great, just great.

500
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,523
Well, you still doing massage?

501
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:23,909
Just the way you like 'em.

502
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,777
Who is this, Sam?

503
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,746
Uh, you know, it's gettin' kinda late.

504
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,247
Maybe you oughta take off.

505
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,249
Bye-bye.

506
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,751
Huh!

507
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,754
Why is it

508
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:40,258
that we cannot go to one,
single, solitary place

509
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,761
in the entire city of Boston

510
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,764
without running into some woman
that you've had a fling with?

511
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,766
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating here.

512
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,267
Mm-hmm. At the market, at the movies,

513
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:54,272
when we got our blood
test, for heaven's sake.

514
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,774
Well, what're we supposed to do, move?

515
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,776
I mean, come on.

516
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,144
Excuse me.

517
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:03,115
Oh, now, don't, no, don't-don't go...

518
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,983
What-what're you so upset about?

519
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,486
I wasn't even dating you
when I went out with Jill.

520
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,988
That's when you were
living with Frasier.

521
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,291
She lived with you?

522
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,046
Well, only briefly. Uh...

523
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:20,799
You said you'd never
lived with anyone but me!

524
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,802
Yeah, open... that's right.

525
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,307
What are you doing?

526
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,309
I should have thought of this earlier.

527
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,812
(chuckling)

528
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,814
Yeah. (chuckles)

529
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,316
LILITH: What was that?

530
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,318
Frasier, what are you doing?

531
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,820
(door rattling)

532
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,822
Frasier, the door seems to be jammed.

533
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,323
(knocking on door) Frasier?

534
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,826
DIANE: Sam, open the door.

535
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:48,827
Macanudo?

536
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,328
Oh!

537
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,830
Frasier! Don't mind if I do.

538
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,831
Thank you. Open the door.

539
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,332
You know, I don't think I can stand

540
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,333
