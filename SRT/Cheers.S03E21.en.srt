1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,832
THE EXECUTlVE'S EXECUTlONER

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,318
Fine. lt's been a pleasure serving you.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,996
Wait a minute. ls this for me?
Wow, a quarter!

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,515
He left me a whole quarter.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,195
Considering the great service
l gave him, l was expecting a big tip,

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,828
but nothing of this magnitude.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,232
Thanks to him l am on Easy Street.
Now l'm going to retire.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,597
All right. l'll give you some more, OK?
Here.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,673
- You have change of a ten?
- Yeah. Now beat it.

10
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,996
Everybody,
you better stay on my good side today.

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,597
Cliff, l've looked at you from every angle.
There is no good side.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,433
What's the problem there, Cliffie?

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,956
A new couple moved in next door
to me and Ma.

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,830
They're loud, noisy, up till all hours
playing their bebop music,

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,835
automobile parts strewn all over
the yard. Nothing l can use.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,753
Why don't you have a word
with these people?

17
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,878
They're not that type of people.

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,272
lt'll only lead to a fight
and you know what l'm liable to do.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,398
Yeah, wet yourself.

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,672
My God! That's my boss.
He saw me slip out early.

21
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,439
- You got here the same time as always.
- l know. l always leave early.

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,516
l refuse to be one of those cowardly
clock-watchers.

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,673
As soon as my supervisor turns
his head, l slip out the heating duct.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,798
- How would he know you're here?
- The company's full of spies.

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,158
They know everything about you.
They even keep track of your sex habits.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,551
Thank God l don't have any.

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,000
He's coming this way.
Cover for me.

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,995
Wait a minute!
Excuse me, wasn't that Norm Peterson?

29
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,994
No, there's no Norm Peterson here.
l don't even know a Norm Peterson.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,233
Are you sure? The man that just ran
into the men's room?

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,473
Absolutely not. Probably somebody
that looked like Norm Peterson...

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,598
- ...who l don't know.
- l see.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,114
And what's this on the floor?

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,831
Foam insulation from our heating duct.
My information is correct.

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,432
Peterson, are you in here?

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,591
- Were you talking to me?
- What are you doing in there?

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,911
Sir, this is close to being an invasion
of privacy.

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,675
But l want to talk to you. l'll wait outside.

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,799
No, sir. l know what you're probably
going to do to me

40
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,590
and this does seem like
the appropriate place for it.

41
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,390
All right. Peterson, we've been making
some changes in the company.

42
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,348
Starting tomorrow, we want you to be
our corporate killer.

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,275
The guy who fires people?

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,276
We decided that terminating employees
puts too much stress on our executives.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,352
- We think you'll be perfect.
- Why me?

46
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,274
Studies have shown
that it's particularly humiliating

47
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,309
when you're fired by somebody
who is clearly superior to yourself.

48
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,836
And that just wouldn't be the case
with you, Norman.

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,833
You're just an ordinary Joe.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,118
As a matter of fact,
we checked out your home life.

51
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,796
You have absolutely nothing
anyone could possibly envy or resent.

52
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,909
l'm honoured, sir. But this sounds
like a horrible job, frankly.

53
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,915
lt's a 300% raise
and if you don't take it, you're fired.

54
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,915
l will have you know that l cannot be
bought and l cannot be threatened,

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,993
but you put the two together
and l'm your man.

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,312
Have you given any thought to using
some form of natural childbirth this time?

57
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,632
- l always use the Le Mans method.
- No, you mean Lamaze.

58
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,952
No, Le Mans. l scream like a Ferrari.

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,036
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,668
What will you have, Norm?

61
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,593
A glass of whatever comes out
of that tap.

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,355
- Looks like beer, Norm.
- Call me Mr Lucky.

63
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,512
l'll take another one
for my young friend there.

64
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,958
- So who is your young friend?
- lt's my first assignment, Cliffie.

65
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,353
l was supposed to fire him this morning.
l haven't been able to do it yet.

66
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,869
You've been with the guy all day
and you haven't canned him?

67
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,271
He's such a sweet kid.
l just can't tear his heart out.

68
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,149
- Can l do it, please?
- Do you mind?

69
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,279
l know what you're talking about.
lt's always hard to fire people.

70
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,831
l always give my waitresses
the benefit of a severance boink.

71
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,592
That or the money equivalent,

72
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,751
$1 .1 4.

73
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,550
As l recall, you were always
after an advance.

74
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,917
Oh, Sam. You're always bringing that up,

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,356
trying to relive
those few precious weeks

76
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,116
with the only woman you ever dated
who knew how to spell your name.

77
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,235
As l recall, you used to spell it
E-X-T-A-S-Y.

78
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,919
You got the ''X'' right.
And it's going to stay that way.

79
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,514
Could we move on to something
more interesting

80
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,274
than your star-crossed romance?

81
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,955
What could be more interesting
than another gripping episode of

82
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,918
''The Young and the Chestless''?

83
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,512
So when are you
going to talk to the guy?

84
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,638
l've been struggling with it all day,
Sammy.

85
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,476
l was going to tell him at lunch, but we
were enjoying ourselves so much.

86
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,030
So l thought l'd take him to a movie,
try to get him relaxed.

87
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,150
- You couldn't tell him there, either?
- No, but l came close at the ball game.

88
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,397
Norman, as you know,
no one is more sensitive than l.

89
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,509
And l say putting it off
is of no value to you or the boy.

90
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,318
l guess you're right.

91
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,637
Thanks for the beer, Mr Peterson.
l sure have had a good time today.

92
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,236
lt's great to get away
from that old sweat shop, isn't it?

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,356
l love my job.

94
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,310
The five months l've had it
have been the best of my life.

95
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,631
- lsn't that exaggerating a bit, Billy?
- Not at all.

96
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,634
Ever since l can remember
l've dreamed of being an accountant.

97
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,476
From the age of six l did odd jobs
to put myself through college.

98
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,076
Now that l have it,
l've got the world at my feet.

99
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,358
l just put a down payment on a house.
lt was more than we wanted,

100
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,832
but escrow closed today
so there's no turning back now.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,675
Besides, with my wife pregnant,
we're going to need the room.

102
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,229
Your...

103
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,192
My wife and l are trying to have
a baby, actually.

104
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,753
That's great! Our kids are going to play
together at the company picnic.

105
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,595
- l don't think so, Billy.
- Why not?

106
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,399
Because you're fired.

107
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,599
- l'm fired?
- lt's not your fault. You're history.

108
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,514
lt's the damn company.
They're cutting back all over the place.

109
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,117
You're a good accountant.
l'm so sorry.

110
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,113
l can't believe it.

111
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,875
lt's not fair! You're so damn young.

112
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,157
That's right.
l've got that going for me.

113
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,996
- l'll find something else.
- ln this job market? Good luck.

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,912
There, there, Mr Peterson.
Don't worry about me. l'll be just fine.

115
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,631
l'm going to make you happy
and proud again.

116
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,951
Are you going to be OK?

117
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,918
Come on, show me a big smile.

118
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,072
Come on. Come on.

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,354
Attaboy.

120
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,832
Stand up here.
Get him a beer there, Diane.

121
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,197
So how did it go, Norm?

122
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,080
Damn company! What do they know
about the pride in a young wife's eye?

123
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,189
The unborn child
and a boy's love of a calculator?

124
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,432
- Norman, stop torturing yourself.
- And us.

125
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,678
l guess Billy Richter's not going
to be the only one without a job.

126
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,197
l'm not cut out to be a corporate killer.

127
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,753
l watched you with that young man.
l've never seen anything like that.

128
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,993
Hey, pal, this is the 1 980s.
lt's OK for a man to cry.

129
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,756
- Thanks, buddy.
- You'd never catch me doing it.

130
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,596
Maybe a manly tear or two,
but never blubbering.

131
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,952
lt's a policy at Talbert lnternational
to send a representative

132
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,317
to check on how employees
handle new assignments.

133
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,678
l've been following you around all day.

134
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,152
How did you like Rice's catch
in the third inning?

135
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,232
That was a great catch.

136
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,598
l guess you'll tell them to find
another killer. l'm relieved, actually.

137
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,070
You made that man feel
that he was fired

138
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,028
from a sensitive, caring company.
lt was brilliant.

139
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,115
l'm going to recommend that they give
you that corner office on the third floor.

140
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,956
- lsn't that Mr Peabody's office?
- Not after you talk with him tomorrow.

141
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,197
l've had it! Those neighbours
have pushed me too far this time.

142
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,319
- What happened now, Clifford?
- Last night they had a party.

143
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,314
Cars parked all over the block,
loud music and who knows what else.

144
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,948
And all this on a school night.

145
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,556
lt's time they found out what you get
when you cross a Clavin.

146
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,156
Someone crossed one
with a chicken and got you.

147
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,276
l beg your pardon?

148
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,230
You shoot your mouth off about this guy,
but you don't do anything.

149
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,154
- You're afraid to stand up to him.
- l'm not afraid of anything.

150
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,950
One of these days l'll tell that jerk
exactly what l think of him.

151
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,351
All right, here you go.

152
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,318
- Write him a letter.
- You don't think l will?

153
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,029
''Howdy, neighbour.
Please don't take this the wrong way...''

154
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,317
Give me that! ''Howdy, neighbour''!

155
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,153
Let me do this.

156
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,468
''Dear vile, scurvy rat,

157
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,315
''whose existence stinks up the planet...''

158
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,948
l guess that is a bit stronger.

159
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,394
Where's Norm?

160
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,519
He's in the back room dropping the axe
on his latest victim.

161
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,036
lt'll be all right.

162
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,795
l'll find another job...some day.

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,713
You promise?

164
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,190
l promise. Now buck up.

165
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,074
That man is a prince.

166
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,232
Norman, why do you keep putting
yourself through this?

167
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,358
You must be emotionally drained
at the end of the day.

168
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,150
Yeah, l am, but l'm good at it.

169
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,916
l finally found something in life
that l'm good at. Pity.

170
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,871
Now we just got to finish it off
with a real doozy.

171
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,715
Does he have any disabilities
you can make fun of?

172
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,474
His wife is not particularly handsome.

173
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,760
Good, good.
''Bark hello to your wife for me.''

174
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,630
''Yours in disgust.'' Sign that.

175
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,031
l'll sign it with pleasure and l'll mail this
at my earliest convenience.

176
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,719
- lt's going out in today's mail.
- Good, good. Glad to hear it.

177
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,273
Look, Clavin, just think of this
as your ticket out of Weenietown.

178
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,751
- l made that trip a long time ago.
- But they threw you out at Dinkville.

179
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,270
Norm, your office called.
They're sending over a John Parker.

180
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,956
Another one?
Last one of the day, l guess.

181
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,238
Let's see what we got here.
John Parker.

182
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,317
35 years with the company, Sam.

183
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,473
He's a widower,
supports sickly parents.

184
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,313
Three foster children.

185
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,313
So sad, so sad.

186
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,074
- Afternoon, Sam. How are we today?
- Fine, Walt. How are you doing?

187
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,155
lt hasn't been an easy day,
but any day l carry the US mail

188
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,790
l count myself a lucky
and useful human being.

189
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,875
- Are all you guys like this?
- Like what?

190
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,874
Never mind.

191
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,635
Hold on a sec, Walt,
l've got some outgoing mail here.

192
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,917
How do you like that?
l just talked to Ma.

193
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,790
Our neighbour's cleaning up his yard.
He would've gotten to it sooner,

194
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,829
but he's been in training for the World
Kick Boxing Championship.

195
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,993
lt's good l found out
before that letter was mailed.

196
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,516
That's excellent use of the nine-digit
zip code, Sam.

197
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,514
Consider these letters in the hands
of the addressees.

198
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,558
Hold on there.

199
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,271
Twitchell, isn't it?
Clavin, South Central Branch, SCB.

200
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,273
Oh, right.

201
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,035
You got a letter in that bag
that l don't need mailed.

202
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,839
l'd appreciate it if l could have it back.

203
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,198
- Sorry.
- What do you mean ''sorry''?

204
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,956
Any letter on my person
for the express purpose of delivery

205
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,829
receives the same sanctity
as in any US Mail receptacle.

206
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,958
But this is a very personal,
important matter to me.

207
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,079
You know the rules.
Hey, that's my bag!

208
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,073
That's a Federal offence, you know.

209
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,675
Get out of here!

210
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,515
That's Clavin. Clavin with a ''C'', right?

211
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,275
- You're in trouble.
- You're in trouble!

212
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,877
- They're going to have your bags.
- Your mother's a bag.

213
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,914
Put a uniform on some guys,
it turns them right into a fascist.

214
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,916
l wouldn't be a bit surprised if that guy
had deep sexual problems.

215
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,831
Norm is sleeping like a baby.

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,231
A baby with a licence to kill.

217
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,155
l guess this job is taking its toll.
l wonder what he's dreaming about?

218
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,949
He's probably dreaming about
what every man dreams about.

219
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,590
ln your case that would be me.

220
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,356
l hardly think that Norm is dreaming
about you.

221
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,237
l stand corrected.

222
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,149
- You OK?
- l'm fine.

223
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,154
Strangest dream.
lt was so weird, Sam.

224
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,393
lt was really dark, you know?
And cold and eerie.

225
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,111
lt was out in the middle of nowhere,
but it was definitely somewhere.

226
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,629
There was this line of accountants.

227
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,078
lt was my job to make them
go through a pair of elevator doors.

228
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,232
Going down.

229
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,076
One by one they went,

230
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,869
falling screaming into a bottomless pit.

231
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,308
There's this accountant wearing
a blindfold. l went up to him.

232
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,549
No, wait. l'm just demonstrating.

233
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,599
Norman, don't you see
what this dream means?

234
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,228
A very precious part of you

235
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,756
feels as if it's being destroyed
by this job.

236
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,151
The burden of your guilt is insupportable.

237
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,074
l never said l was in love with this job,
OK?

238
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,596
l think it stinks.
But it is important.

239
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,719
These guys would all be fired anyway.
l provide a service.

240
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,997
l'm helping them through
a painful experience.

241
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,312
Norman, these executives
are having you do their dirty work.

242
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,268
- You are their Judas goat.
- Lighten up, will ya, Diane?

243
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,954
You should have more pride

244
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,113
than to do repugnant tasks for people
at their bidding.

245
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,397
You want to wipe up that bar sweat
there?

246
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,349
- Can l get you something?
- No.

247
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,430
- Are you OK?
- No.

248
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,390
Norm Peterson invited me
for a beer at Cheers.

249
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,433
- He's sitting down right over there.
- So that's him?

250
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,470
Hi. You must be John Parker.
Norm Peterson here.

251
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,358
l know.

252
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,433
lt's really terrible what you have
to do to me, isn't it?

253
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,592
- You know why you're here?
- Everybody knows about you.

254
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,832
Then l guess there's nothing left
to say.

255
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,357
What do you mean?
Where's my sympathy?

256
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,354
Where's the caring?
Where's the tears?

257
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,957
- l do feel bad for you, John.
- Doesn't look like it.

258
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,029
Honestly, John, l feel just awful.

259
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,359
You've foster children, l believe?

260
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,672
Yes. One of them needs braces.

261
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,629
l would rather have somebody fire me
honestly than fake sentiment.

262
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,157
You hide your true feelings
behind crocodile tears.

263
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,029
John, listen, wait a second.
Let me try again, John.

264
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,508
Sickly parents.

265
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,510
l'm dry as a bone.

266
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,831
Do you know what's happening to you,
Norman?

267
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,630
- You're becoming callous and hard.
- Yeah, l know.

268
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,592
Give me the phone and a beer.

269
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,988
- What are you doing?
- Quitting.

270
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,276
l'm calling Mr Simpson
and telling him l'm resigning.

271
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,070
l'm going to let the bosses do their own
dirty work for a change.

272
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,471
Mr Simpson?
This is Norm Peterson, sir.

273
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,076
We really have to have a...
Hello?

274
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,519
He screamed and hung up.
l'll try him again.

275
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,589
ls this Mr Simpson's secretary?
This is Norm Peterson.

276
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,797
We seem to have been... Hello?

277
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,198
You see what's happening here,
don't you?

278
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,151
This is amazing. Why don't l just give
Mr Hecht a little call?

279
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,472
Why don't l tell him how good
the little plan is going?

280
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,751
Mr Hecht, this is Norm Peterson.

281
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,795
