00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,503
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,806
Woody, could we have
some more pretzels, please?

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,843
Woody?

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,445
Oh, sorry, Dr. Crane.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,048
I... I was just thinking
about how big the universe is.

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,283
Yes, it is, Woody.

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,351
As a matter of fact,

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,519
it's expanding
all the time.

9
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,521
Spiraling outward,
ad infinitum,

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,922
from the center
of its origin

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,692
at an alarming
seven miles per second.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,262
You mean all of us
are getting bigger?

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,766
Well, no, Woody, we...
we're not expanding.

14
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,000
The universe is.

15
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,802
Although some of us
could stand to eat

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,737
a few less
jelly doughnuts.

17
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,876
So, as the universe expands,
what happens to us?

18
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,178
Well, someday
we'll just explode

19
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,880
into billions of atoms,

20
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,715
which themselves will
cease to exist in time.

21
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,750
Why, in ten
quadrillion years,

22
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,887
there'll be nothing
left of anything.

23
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,690
May I have
those pretzels now, Woody?

24
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,961
Sure, better get them
while you can.

25
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,597

Good morning, unwashed masses.

41
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,840
Hey, hey, a new suit
there, huh, Cliffie?

42
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,108
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Like it?

43
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,911
Shiny as the penny
you spent on it.

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,550
Oh, no, sorry, ma'am.

45
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,353
No open flames
near this suit.

46
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,124
So, uh,...

47
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,793
what's the
occasion, Cliff?

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,794
My girlfriend,
Margaret.

49
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,295
Just picked her up
at the airport,

50
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,630
dropped her off
at the hotel.

51
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,632
She'll be by
in a few minutes.
All right!

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,434
Margaret's back
from Canada.

53
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,868
Yeah, yeah.
She just couldn't take

54
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,370
those brutal
freezing winters

55
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,471
those sub-zero
temperatures,

56
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,540
the lonely sense
of isolation,

57
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,475
so she's, uh, coming
back to me.

58
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,944
Yeah? Well, the grass
is always greener.

59
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,412
(chuckles)

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,348
Hey, Cliffie,
do we, uh, hear...

61
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,117
(glasses jingling)
wedding bells?
Ah.

62
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,285
(chuckling)

63
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,887
<i>Not for this muchacho,
there, Sammy.</i>

64
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,090
What are you talking about?
I thought you always wanted
to get married.

65
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,625
No, no, no, no.
No time soon, that's for sure.

66
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,563
Hey, there's still a lot of
postage left on this U.S. male.

67
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,501
Yeah, well, the only
real hurdle left is Ma.

68
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,602
Yeah?

69
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,304
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's very traumatic

70
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,373
when the woman you love
more than anything else

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,174
in the world meets
your significant other.

72
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,643
Which would be
which, Cliff?

73
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,015
Well, now you see
my problem.

74
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,917
So, uh, what'd your ma say
when you told her?

75
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,853
Well, I'm gonna break it
to her this afternoon.

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,654
See, I came up
with this great idea.

77
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm gonna tell her
in a public place

78
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,125
where I'm surrounded
by my friends, you see?

79
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,626
Then she'll have
to control herself

80
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,361
and she won't embarrass me.

81
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,330
Clifford,

82
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,801
for the hundredth time, if you
want to use my shower cap

83
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,872
in the morning, will you put it
back where you found it?

84
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,141
Perhaps as a reminder,

85
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,310
you'd like to wear it
for the rest of the day?

86
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,250
You know, suddenly
I see Cliff

87
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,886
as heroically
well-adjusted.

88
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,690
Sam, I was a little off
on payroll,

89
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,492
so I just made up
a bunch of numbers and...

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,861
What are you doing?
You're drinking coffee.

91
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,129
Yeah. So?

92
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,230
You can't drink coffee

93
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,365
when we're trying
to make a baby.

94
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,399
I don't know.

95
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,500
I'm pretty coordinated.

96
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,941
Sam, that's not the point.

97
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,210
You were supposed to stay
in peak physical condition.

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,012
You know, caffeine loading
could be the reason

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,381
why we haven't been
able to conceive for
the last two months.

100
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,350
Come on. It's just
a cup of coffee.

101
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,251
No, Sam, you have
to promise me something.

102
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,487
Till I am pregnant,
you have to stay
in better shape.

103
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,055
You have to stop
drinking coffee,

104
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,523
stop eating junk food

105
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,692
and stop staying up
late watching movies.

106
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,227
Why don't you just kill the man?

107
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,897
All right,
all right,
all right.

108
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,499
If you really think
this is important,

109
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll, uh, I'll stop
drinking coffee.

110
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,335
All right, good.
I mean, we only have

111
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,104
two days left
in this month.

112
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,705
What do you mean?

113
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,741
Well, you see here
on the calendar,

114
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,744
I, I put a B for
baby on the days

115
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,078
when I'm likely
to conceive.

116
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,414
You know, the days when
we should make love.

117
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,116
That's funny.
I usually put an F.

118
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,019
F?

119
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,587
For "fertile."

120
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,355
What did you
think I meant?

121
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,557
You know...

122
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,594
I'm, I'm not so sure
I want you to carry my baby.

123
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,966
So, you see, the
entire region

124
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,602
might more accurately
be described

125
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,571
as "The Bermuda
Rhombus".

126
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,709
Well, thanks, Ma.
Mm-hmm.

127
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,712
Look, Ma, there's something
I think we'd better talk about,

128
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,148
and, uh, I'm not so sure
you want to hear it.

129
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,117
Well, what the heck,
here goes.

130
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,186
I, uh, I met somebody.

131
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,488
Yeah, actually,
more than a somebody.

132
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,823
It's a woman.

133
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,526
This isn't like the time
you had your heart set

134
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,828
on Priscilla
Presley, is it?

135
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,497
No, no, Ma.

136
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,966
This is more than a few
hundred silly letters.

137
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,640
I, uh, I actually
know this gal.

138
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,009
Yeah, see, her name
is Margaret.

139
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,110
She's from Canada.

140
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,980
I love her,
and she loves me.

141
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,651
Oh... I understand,
Clifford.

142
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,686
If this is the woman

143
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,090
you've chosen to
take my place...

144
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,827
I guess the only thing
for me to do is die.

145
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,433
Ma, what are you doing?

146
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,269
I'm dying.

147
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,938
You're not dying.

148
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,306
Will you stop it?
Come on.

149
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,142
No need to take me to
the graveyard, Clifford.

150
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,678
Just set me next
to your tubby
friend there.

151
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,383
And when I
start to bloat,

152
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,518
just toss me
in the Dumpster.

153
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,820
Thanks for bringing your ma by.

154
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,127
It's the way
I want to go,

155
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,896
alone in a bar without my son.

156
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,600
Anyone who is blood-type O
is welcome to my organs.

157
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,802
I don't recommend the heart.

158
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,970
It's been broken.

159
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,774
What's that, Grandma?

160
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,475
Come toward the light?

161
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,377
Ma!

162
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,548
Ma, you're not dying.

163
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,850
Now stop it!
(door opens)

164
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,453
CLIFF:
Oh, now here's
Margaret now.

165
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,121
So, let's go meet her,
and then now, please,

166
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,723
just behave yourself,
will you, Ma?

167
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,027
I'll put off dying just
long enough to meet her.

168
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,598
This is turning out
better than I expected.

169
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,971
Ma, this is Margaret.

170
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,142
Margaret, this is Ma.

171
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,979
Hello.

172
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,548
Hello.

173
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,620
Well, enough
of this chitchat, huh?

174
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,657
Listen, I've got some,
uh, lunch reservations up there

175
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,325
at Melville's for, uh, me
and my gals.

176
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,360
What do you say?

177
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,861
Oh, I get to have lunch,

178
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,764
and then it's off
to the ice floe.

179
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,333
Oh, you must
be referring
to the custom

180
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,336
of the Inuit people, where
they set their golden-agers

181
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,838
on an ice floe to die.

182
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,706
How did you
know that?

183
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,842
Oh, I love trivia.

184
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,011
Good answer.

185
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,246
Yeah, well, uh,
shall we go, ladies?

186
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,547
Mm.

187
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,816
Command of trivia
is one of the things

188
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,585
that attracted me
to Cliff.

189
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,021
Uh, that and his manners.

190
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,789
Good heavens.
His what?

191
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,524
His manners.

192
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,594
Oh, my dear, I thought
you said his manhood.

193
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,595
(laughs)

194
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,543
Sam, I...

195
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,311
Are you drinking coffee again?

196
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,914
No. No, no, this is for Norm.

197
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,784
(coughs)

198
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,862
I think I figured out

199
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,497
why you haven't been able
to give me a baby.

200
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,299
<i>What makes you think
it's my fault?</i>

201
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,701
Well, I've been doing
some reading,

202
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,703
and I think I know
what the problem is.

203
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,004
You wear bikini briefs,
don't you?

204
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,506
Sweetheart, I know the
lights are usually out,

205
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,075
but I do take 'em off.

206
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,978
Sam, look. Look--

207
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,281
according to this brochure,
briefs are bad for you.

208
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,783
They're constricting, they
raise your body temperature,

209
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,620
sometimes rendering your
little swimmers ineffectual.

210
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,189
Look at the little cartoon.

211
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,358
Oh, gee!

212
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,692
Sam, the bottom line is,

213
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,361
we have to lower
the temperature down there.

214
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,829
Well, how are we
gonna do that?

215
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:02,468
With these underpants lined
with freon-based gel.

216
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,507
You want me to wear
frozen underwear?

217
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,243
I, I'll freeze my....

218
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,178
Exactly.

219
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,720
Oh, I haven't looked
at these in ages.

220
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,855
MARGARET:
Is that Cliff?

221
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:23,856
Oh, my, no.

222
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,090
That's Clifford's father.

223
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,259
You see where Clifford
got his wide bottom.

224
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,895
Mm. I've always
wondered.

225
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,064
When Clifford was a baby,

226
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,868
we'd set him down
and gently push him over.

227
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,203
And wouldn't you know,
he'd pop right back up

228
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,206
just like, just like one
of those inflatable clowns!

229
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,374
(laughs)

230
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,511
Well, come on, sit,
sit, sit, please.

231
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,346
Bartender, how about
a couple of drinks

232
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,881
for my lovely
ladies here, huh?

233
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,383
In the meanwhile, I'll go
and, uh, use the facilities.

234
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,019
Clifford,
don't be vulgar.

235
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,423
Sorry, Ma.

236
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,759
So, Cliff,
how'd it go upstairs?

237
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,094
Oh, great.
They got along

238
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,595
like, uh, two
long-lost friends.

239
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,199
All through lunch,
it was just yak,
yak, yak, yak.

240
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,901
Couple of real
chatterboxes, huh?

241
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,838
Uh, no. Ma just knows
a lot of trivia about yaks.

242
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,210
Shall I make a
general announcement?

243
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,045
Oh, well, shouldn't
we wait for Cliff

244
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,413
to get back
from the restroom?

245
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,648
Oh, let's not hurry him.

246
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,650
That's his alone time.

247
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,353
(spoon rapping glass)

248
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,787
ESTHER:
Everybody,

249
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,656
I have an announcement to make.

250
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:36,195
This beautiful, young lady,
Margaret Catherine O'Keefe,

251
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,232
has agreed to become
my daughter-in-law.

252
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,039
Hey, what's going on?

253
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,274
Why, your wedding,
Clifford.

254
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,211
Uh, beg your pardon?

255
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,946
Isn't this great?!

256
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,148
I'm going to be
the next Mrs. Clavin!

257
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:02,988
He has the same look he had
when he took me to the prom.

258
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,800
Don't say no.

259
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,803
I want to buy you
a mobile home.

260
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,440
Now, I can't afford
the deluxe model

261
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,775
with the front
porch, so...

262
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,842
Oh, well,
that's okay.

263
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,611
We'll make it home.

264
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,945
I'm awfully handy.

265
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,414
I... I can make
a nice gravel garden,

266
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,116
and we can buy one
of those concrete gnomes.

267
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,652
You're already getting one.

268
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,759
Oh, this is
so exciting!

269
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,127
I'm about
ready to burst.

270
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,829
I have to go
call my parents.
Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,499
And, with any luck,
by this time next year,

272
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,234
we're going to hear
the pitter-patter

273
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,204
of little Clavin feet.

274
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,707
Woody... Woody,
hold this for me.

275
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,041
Hold this knife.

276
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,510
Lower.

277
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,146
(yelling)

278
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,548
Ah!

279
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,357
Ma, you know, this is
all happening so fast.

280
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,225
I mean, here I am
going to marry Margaret,

281
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,728
I don't even remember proposing.

282
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,763
No. If we waited
for you to propose,

283
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,465
I'd never be
a grandmother.

284
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,567
What are you talking about?

285
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,304
Oh, dear. I was
afraid of this.

286
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,006
I think we'd better
have a little talk.

287
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,642
Woody!

288
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,512
Two whiskeys, and
leave the bottle.

289
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,217
Now, I don't want you
to think

290
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,185
that I'm looking forward
to this

291
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,854
but with your father
out of the picture...

292
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,322
(breathes deeply)

293
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,424
...it's one of those crosses
I'm going to have to bear,

294
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,959
along with many others.

295
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,727
ESTHER:
Now, when

296
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,331
a man and woman love
each other very much,

297
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,270
they share a very special
kind... of... hug.

298
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,476
Ooh... ah!

299
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,348
Ma, look, you don't have
to tell me all this stuff.

300
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,150
I already know.

301
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,552
All right, who's
the dirty mouth

302
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,587
who's been telling
my son these things?

303
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:27,599
Only, um... only I used
a different word for "hug."

304
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,707
Here's a pamphlet to
fill in the many gaps

305
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,276
left by lover-boy
over there.

306
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,812
Read it. Read it before
your wedding night.

307
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,881
"Howard's New Feelings".

308
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,150
My parents are thrilled!

309
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,120
They're giving us a freezer
full of meat!

310
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,289
Wow! Huh?

311
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,024
Well, let's get busy.

312
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,926
We have so much to do.

313
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,061
We have to shop for a dress

314
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,996
and get a marriage license.

315
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,231
Oh, and the bakery!

316
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,766
We're going to have

317
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,202
a great big chocolate
wedding cake.

318
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,670
Whoa! Hold on there, Ma.

319
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,971
You know, I'm allergic
to chocolate, don't forget.

320
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,674
Then you may have
graham crackers.

321
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,244
Really?

322
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,483
Well, I'm off to get
that marriage license.

323
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,884
Now, before you go, Cliff,

324
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,687
I'd like to offer
my congratulations.

325
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,390
I, for one, will
be enthusiastically
tracking your development.

326
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,292
I mean, uh...
sharing your joy.

327
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,628
Thank you, Lilith.

328
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,030
Thank you very much.

329
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,100
Well, Cliff,
Cliff, Cliff, huh?

330
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,503
His life is never going to
be the same after this.

331
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,972
Yeah. Regular sex.

332
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,740
Wait a minute.

333
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,375
I thought you said
he was getting married.

334
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,814
CARLA:
Uh... Sammy, two beers.

335
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:49,948
Get them yourself.

336
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,350
You okay, Sam?

337
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,718
It's none of your business.

338
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,153
Sam, we're out
of olives.

339
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,755
That's your problem,
isn't it?

340
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,357
Gee, these shorts are cold!

341
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,535
I couldn't help
noticing, dear,

342
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:14,106
that all the wedding
dresses you favored
were pure white.

343
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,709
Can I assume
that's appropriate?

344
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,846
Well, here we are!

345
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,748
All right. Message received.

346
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,550
None of my business.

347
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,287
Say, uh... listen.

348
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,588
You're going to
marry Cliff, right?

349
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,689
That's right.

350
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,926
Well, could you just
do me a little favor?

351
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,361
What's that?

352
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:40,032
Don't bring any more
Clavins into this world.

353
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,534
It's not right.
It's just not right.

354
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,537
Poor, poor Carla.

355
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,174
Cliff told me all about
the affair you had with him.

356
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,248
And I just want you to know
that I bear no grudge.

357
00:16:56,316 --> 00:17:00,085
I... I...

358
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,522
I...

359
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,125
I didn't know Carla
and Cliff had an affair.

360
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,927
That explains a lot.

361
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,763
That poor woman.

362
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,233
I know he cut her deeply
when he broke up with her.

363
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,869
But, Rebecca,
you seem to have bounced back.

364
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,612
Sammy, how's it going?

365
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,748
You ever try to start your car
on a really cold winter morning?

366
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,583
Yeah. Sure.

367
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,985
Yeah, well, nobody
in their right mind

368
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,086
would expect it to start.
Am I right?

369
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,187
Yeah. You're right.

370
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,755
Yeah, well,
you tell that to Rebecca!

371
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:40,426
Oh! Sorry I'm late, everybody.

372
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,061
How you doing?

373
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,629
You wouldn't believe
all those people

374
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,698
down at the marriage bureau
waiting for a license.

375
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,300
Pretty soon, Maggie,
it's going to be you and me.

376
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,635
We'll be joining them, huh?

377
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,036
I can't wait, Cliff.

378
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,339
I'm one happy fella!

379
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,807
Gosh, I'm happy!

380
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,742
And you're the one who
made me so happy, honey.

381
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,578
You're all invited
to the wedding.

382
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,180
Doc, can I see you
in the office, please?

383
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,781
Sure, Cliff.

384
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,751
I'll be with you in
just a minute, my betrothed.

385
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:06,952
Hey, who would have thought

386
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,654
Cliff Clavin was ready
for commitment?

387
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,292
Doc, you gotta help me.

388
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,661
I mean, it's all
happening so fast.

389
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,830
One minute, I...
I'm leading my life.

390
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,498
And the next minute,
before you know it,

391
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,266
I'm standing in a line
down at the marriage bureau

392
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,068
with a bunch of other people
waiting for a license.

393
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,838
I looked into their eyes.
You know what I saw?

394
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:29,241
The smell of death.

395
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,680
Aren't you exaggerating
just a bit?

396
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,615
Oh, no. Fras,
when I was a teenager,

397
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,284
I used to work
at a slaughterhouse.

398
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,553
And I watched them
when they brought them in,

399
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,757
and I watched them
when they took them out.

400
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,759
But I've never seen
nothing like that.

401
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,829
Ma's really done it
to me this time.

402
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,032
Cliff, why do you have
to do what she says?

403
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,200
She's Ma.

404
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,468
Look. Think back.

405
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,104
Have you ever stood up
to your mother?

406
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,807
Have you ever stood up
to Lilith?

407
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,809
Touché, Cliff,

408
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,644
but we're not
discussing me.

409
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,312
Look, Fras, I know
what you're trying to say--

410
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,081
that I should stand up
to my mother.

411
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,449
Well, you're not
telling me anything

412
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,750
I haven't
been telling myself

413
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,987
since my 35th birthday.

414
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,956
It's just that, if I do,
it'll hurt Ma's feelings.

415
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,692
What about
Cliff's feelings?

416
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,328
Who cares about
Cliff's feelings?
You should.

417
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,031
You have the right to do
with your life what you will.

418
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,267
Don't worry about
what other people will think.

419
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,003
Your first
responsibility
is to you.

420
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,971
You're a real person,

421
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,007
worthy of consideration
and respect.

422
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:37,476
Am I interrupting
anything?

423
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,878
Oh, no, Maggie.
Just nothing important.

424
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,380
Cliff was, you know...

425
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,890
Cliff, is something wrong?

426
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,960
It's about the
wedding, Margaret.

427
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,830
I don't think I want to
get married just yet.

428
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,000
Why, Cliff?
Don't you love me?

429
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,736
Oh, Maggie,
of course I love you.

430
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,504
But, if we're going
to get married,

431
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,473
I want it to be our
decision, and not Ma's.

432
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,744
That woman has been making
decisions for me long enough.

433
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,247
We'll know in our hearts
when the time is right.

434
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,017
Oh, Cliff!

435
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,722
Maggie, when
I propose to you,

436
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,559
it's going to be the
most romantic thing
you've ever heard.

437
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,795
I don't know, Cliff.

438
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,164
It would be awfully hard
to beat the way your ma said it.

439
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,299
Yeah.

440
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,768
Oh, Margaret?

441
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,704
You'll, uh... you'll still
be my girlfriend, won't you?

442
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,506
Oh, yes, Cliff.

443
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,041
I understand
completely.

444
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,209
You want to be
your own man.

445
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,246
Exactly. All right!

446
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,948
Now, would you get out there
and tell that to my mother?

447
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,187
That's wonderful.

448
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,556
Good news, kiddies!

449
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,992
The wedding's going
to have a luau theme.

450
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,029
I've booked
the Tiki Hut
on Route Nine.

451
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,132
Ma, I want to talk to you.

452
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,401
You can stop grinding
that organ right now.

453
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,437
I'm taking off my little hat.

454
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,906
I'm not your monkey anymore.

455
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,408
Clifford, we haven't
got time for the
monkey speech.

456
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,877
We're too busy.

457
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,180
I love you, Ma,

458
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,082
but I'm not going to be
railroaded into marriage

459
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,249
just to make you happy.

460
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,285
You've been running
my life long enough,

461
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,153
and it's time for me
to take the wheel.

462
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,222
Why, Clifford Clavin,

463
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,659
how dare you speak
to your mother like that?!

464
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,327
I'm 42 years old,

465
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,595
and I'll speak to
you any way I wish!

466
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,898
My word!

467
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,367
Come on, Maggie!

468
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,505
We got a lot of living to do!

469
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,342
Whoo!

470
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,479
Oh! Oh!

471
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,448
You still with me, Maggie?

472
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,684
My tooth, Cliff!

473
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,288
MARGARET:
Ohh!

474
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,091
(both screaming)

475
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:12,865
I see I still have to do
everything for the boy.

476
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:19,972
(Cliff groans)

477
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,548
I'll be back for you
in a minute, Clifford!
