00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,997
THE BARTENDER'S TALE

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,233
- Who's the lovely lady?
- An applicant for the waitress job.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,394
lt isn't easy for him to find somebody
to work for the wages he pays you.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,394
With tips l clear about 500 bucks
a week, Clavin.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,033
- That can't be right, is it?
- l did her taxes.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,350
You're saying that a Federal employee,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,637
entrusted with the most noble
service of our society,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,759
makes less money than a wench
who serves beer to slobs on bar stools?

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,514
Makes sense to me, Cliffie.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,912
No, really, l could go up to
three days or so without mail.

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,913
Carla, l'd like you to meet Sydney.

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,152
Sydney is an applicant
for our waitress opening.

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,709
She passed my interview
with flying colours.

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,429
Pending your approval,
l'd like to start her this afternoon.

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,151
- Have you served the public before?
- You mean dressed?

16
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,074
Take a hike, Sydney.

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,073
l'll call you this afternoon,
see how you're doing.

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,310
Thank you. You're a very nice man.

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,029
You're nice, too. We've only known
each other for a few minutes,

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,589
but l feel like
we've known each other all day.

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,399
- Yeah, me, too.
- You take care.

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,428
You know, Sam, when Diane left
for Europe...thank you, God...

23
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,515
you promised to hire an actual waitress,
not a girl that you love and leave.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,470
They're bad for business. They never
last a week and l do all the work.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,714
You can give your approval before l hire
them, but you don't have to be so picky.

26
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,830
l want someone who doesn't make us
think of the word boob at the same time.

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,554
What is this, lBM?
Come on, let's not argue about this.

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,110
We can find somebody who's
going to make us both very happy.

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,556
- Brenda Wood?
- Hi. That's me.

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,190
Hi there, Brenda. Come on down here.
Let's take a look at your application.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,275
l see that your turn-ons include
banana daiquiris by a fireside,

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,590
and men in tight jeans.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,719
- You're cute.
- l'm sold. Come over here.

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,553
- l'd like you to meet Brenda.
- Beat it.

35
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,676
- But, Sam...
- You heard me.

36
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,354
Back to the bimbo union hall.

37
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,193
Darn it, Brenda. l guess
Carla thought you were overqualified.

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,477
You know what might ease
that sting of rejection?

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,030
What would happen if l were to slip
into tight jeans this weekend

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,317
and have you over to my place
for a banana daiquiri?

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,917
- Do you have a fireplace?
- No, but l got a sofa that's flammable.

42
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,949
- That'd be fine.
- All right. You take care. Bye-bye.

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,997
- The search continues, Sammy?
- lt's tough being me.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,749
- OK, Lillian Huxley.
- How do you do, Mr Malone?

45
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,438
Hi, Lillian. Thank you for coming down,
but this position has been filled already.

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,957
- We'll keep your résumé on file.
- Freeze, slimeball.

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,236
- Yes, Carla.
- You lech.

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,790
This is the best résumé l've ever seen.
Look at these references.

49
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,758
She's been schlepping booze
for 25 years.

50
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,392
And my turn-ons include hunting dogs,
Thackeray and Welsh rarebit.

51
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,279
She's exactly what we need.
A career waitress.

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,556
- You are?
- That l am, Mr Malone.

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,794
l'm one of those people who felt the tug
of their true calling early in life.

54
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,637
When l was but 1 8, l filled in one day
for a mate at a pub. Excuse me.

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,191
l realised that day that l could have
no happier or finer destiny in store

56
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,477
than distributing refreshments
in a public house.

57
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,996
Through the years l've lead many
a rugger side in a bawdy song,

58
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,311
and countless times offered
my shoulder to cry on.

59
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,074
But never once
have l regretted my decision.

60
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,109
l shall consider my life well spent if it can
be honestly carved on my gravestone...

61
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,159
''Lillian Huxley never kept
a thirsty man waiting for his ale,

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,950
''and she always brought him
a wee bit more than a pint.''

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,315
Bravo!

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,312
l'm not too sure l like her attitude.

65
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,594
<i>Bene</i>, <i>molto bene.</i>

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,829
Your heat control is over there.
lf you need anything, call the front desk.

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,309
Thank you very much. That'll be all.

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,749
Listen, 200,000 lire,
that's about right, right?

69
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,353
- <i>Grazie</i>, <i>signore.</i>
- <i>Prego.</i>

70
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,633
Frasier, a letter from Cheers.

71
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,557
Wait, it's not a letter.
lt's a Lillian Huxley's résumé.

72
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,197
And it's signed,
''Ha ha, you're out of here for ever.''

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,636
Always nice to hear from Carla.

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,473
Diane,
Cheers is thousands of miles away.

75
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,871
Let's leave them
on the other side of the great ocean?

76
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,157
- Of course. l love you.
- <i>Et tu</i>, <i>Diane.</i>

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,273
Did l just hear you say that you tipped
that bellboy 200,000 lire?

78
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,989
What is it? A dollar or two?
This inflated currency is ridiculous.

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,950
l keep expecting a bum to walk up and
ask for a million lire for a cup of coffee.

80
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,796
You tipped the man $1 00
to bring our bags eight feet.

81
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,474
Are you sure?

82
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,679
This'll get a hearty laugh
out of the folks at the institute.

83
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,957
Just explain it to him.
l'm sure he'll understand.

84
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,317
- You mean go down and get it back?
- What else?

85
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,917
These people think so little
of Americans as it is...

86
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,116
- l'll go.
- No.

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,750
lf l send a woman,
they'd think even less of me. l'll do it.

88
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,797
My brave little tourist.

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,397
Yes. l guess it's time to nip
this thing in the bud.

90
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,675
Come in.

91
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,993
Let's sing
''Don't Dilly Dally On The Way''.

92
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,472
No, l'm tired of that one. How about
a little ''Knees Up, Mother Brown''?

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,154
No, l'm afraid l'm too overcome.

94
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,676
All right,
let's sell some beers around here.

95
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,230
My aching back.
My postal career is over.

96
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,998
Cliff, you look terrible.

97
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,915
- Was today Sears catalogue day?
- That's right.

98
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,438
Yeah and that's not all. Spiegel
catalogue came out at the same time.

99
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,518
lt's a phenomenon
that happens once every 27 years

100
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,672
when both marketing strategies
are in the same equinox.

101
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,077
- Come here, you great silly sausage.
- What's going on?

102
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,754
Hush, pet.

103
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,357
Fear not. One, two...

104
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,070
Hey, Lillian, thank you very much.

105
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,994
l feel like grabbing every woman
in the joint and just dancing.

106
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,594
How much to put him back
the way he was?

107
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,910
Carla, l've got customers to serve.

108
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,635
Well, Sammy, Lillian's week is almost up.

109
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,598
Will you keep her on?
l'm dying of curiosity.

110
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,675
l admit when l'm wrong. She's terrific.
The customers love her. She's perfect.

111
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,356
There's no chance of any romantic
complication to screw things up.

112
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,672
Amen. No more sex stuff with anybody
even remotely connected with this bar.

113
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,239
Promise?

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,994
On my honour,
as a great looking human being.

115
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,438
Anyway, l have just seen the woman
in whose arms l hope to die.

116
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,870
Hi there. Allow me to introduce myself.

117
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,554
l'm Sam Malone,
the next love of your life.

118
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,350
- l've heard you Yanks were bold.
- You sound exactly like...

119
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,511
- Carolyn.
- Mummy.

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,035
- Sam.
- Carla.

121
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,235
Your mother never told me
she had a daughter.

122
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,552
She never told me
she had such a handsome boss.

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,393
Carolyn's visiting
her old mummy for a few days.

124
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,869
- Lillian, you're up here.
- Excuse me.

125
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,157
l must teach this bloke
how to play a proper game of darts.

126
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,790
l'll be back in
an embarrassingly short time.

127
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,677
So, Carolyn, how do you like Boston
now that you've seen the sight?

128
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,354
- l love it.
- Sam, could l talk to you?

129
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,715
- Not now.
- Now.

130
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,678
l'm on final approach
and am cleared for landing.

131
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,389
Haul your butt over here now, sky king.

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,517
Will you excuse me for a moment?
What?

133
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,990
lf you take Carolyn out,
it's going to go bad like always

134
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,958
and you'll lose the two best
waitresses you ever had.

135
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,270
- Carla, l hardly...
- l'm warning you.

136
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,431
You go out with her and l quit.

137
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,795
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

138
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,999
OK, all right. As far as l'm concerned,
Carolyn's off limits.

139
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,116
That's your brain talking, Sam.

140
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,717
l would like to hear from the part
of your body that does the thinking.

141
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,910
lt's in agreement, too.

142
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,351
l'm sorry to be
such a miserable host here.

143
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,273
So you're from England?

144
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,036
Yes. l'm just in the States for a few days
to shoot a layout for British Vogue.

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,036
Wait. That calls for a little of
the old welcome-to-the-US champagne.

146
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,476
- Great.
- A little of the old bubbly here.

147
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,949
So you're a model?

148
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,240
Yes, l do lingerie mostly. Teddies,
merry widows, garter belts.

149
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,279
- This is my portfolio.
- l'll give you $1 ,000 for it.

150
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,559
l don't know if l want you to look at it.
l only brought it in to show mummy.

151
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,234
Come on. Give her a little privacy.

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,757
- l suppose it won't do any harm.
- All right, here we go.

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,589
lnteresting shot. l like that one.

154
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,718
That's nice.
That's nice lighting on that one.

155
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,633
Bet they used an f-stop on that one.

156
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,237
Now, see,
l like the composition on that.

157
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,359
- What are those? Ducks?
- Yes, that's right.

158
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,276
l really didn't want to do this one nude,
but you know...

159
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,479
No, l think it's very tasteful.
lt makes a point.

160
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,716
Sammy, the ice.

161
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,069
Thank you very much.

162
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,836
Could you just give me a second here?
l'll be right back.

163
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,714
Carla, can l speak to you
for a moment here?

164
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,759
Remember that conversation we had
about me not going out with Carolyn?

165
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,911
Can we pretend it never took place?

166
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,629
You bet. l'll just go pack my stuff.
Nice knowing you.

167
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,032
Listen. come on.
The lady is coming on to me.

168
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,079
lf l resist,
l could damage some organs here.

169
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,311
l don't care. lf you go out with her, l quit.

170
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,837
OK, all right, fine. There are millions
of women on this planet.

171
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,150
l can certainly forgo one of them.

172
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,873
lronic that she's the most gorgeous one
l've ever seen, but that's life.

173
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,589
Sam, the champagne is marvellous.

174
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,354
You know how to make a girl
feel welcome.

175
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,318
That's nothing. l do that for everybody.

176
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,718
She's really coming on to Sam,
isn't she?

177
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,632
Sam. That's rich.

178
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,634
Norm, your naivety amazes me.

179
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,756
What are you talking about?

180
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,798
She's doing all this for my benefit.

181
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,032
You notice she's talking loud
so l can hear everything?

182
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,990
That woman wants me more than
any woman has wanted me before.

183
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,709
Cliffie, sometimes you really scare me.

184
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,591
Sam, what about this Cape Cod place
l've been hearing about?

185
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,428
l hear that it's terribly romantic
at this time of year.

186
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,797
Well, you know, l guess it could be.

187
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,748
Tell me, are there
any clothing-optional beaches there?

188
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,309
l like to get an all-over tan.

189
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,999
l know it's more common in Europe
than it is in America,

190
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,109
so l came prepared with a bikini,
but it's such a skimpy little thing.

191
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,430
l'm having a real hard time with this map.
l just can't make head or tail of it.

192
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,956
l really don't think l'm going
to be able to find my way there.

193
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,998
l'll take you.

194
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,637
- Great. What a lovely surprise.
- l'll take you.

195
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,149
l'll let Carla go and l'll take you.

196
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,034
l'll turn this into a self-serve bar
and l'll take you.

197
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,716
- When did you have in mind?
- l'll take you right this very minute.

198
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
- My car is outside.
- What the hell's going on?

199
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,034
Carla, l can explain this. l'll take you.

200
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,239
- You make me sick.
- l know. l'll take you.

201
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,194
Carla, l'm a weak man.

202
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,673
Someday l will find a cure for what
l have, but please, let me have this.

203
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,633
Don't make me beg.
Please, don't make me beg, Carla.

204
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,349
- Tell your mommy not to make me beg.
- Get off.

205
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,310
- ls that a yes?
- At least she's not Diane.

206
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,994
- Look, l'll tell you what.
- What?

207
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,833
Tell Lillian you're taking her daughter out.

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,833
lf she says it's OK,
l'll stick around for a while.

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,594
ls that all? l'll do it.
l'll make you proud of me.

210
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,716
Just one more minute.

211
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,997
Have one more for the bed,
the beach, the road.

212
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,833
Lillian, can l see you
in my office for a minute?

213
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,992
- Certainly. Back in a jiffy, darling.
- Super, Mummy.

214
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,799
Carolyn's filling out nicely,
don't you think?

215
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,190
Lillian, l got a problem here.

216
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,591
ln the past l've gotten into trouble
with my waitresses

217
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,274
by getting
romantically involved with them.

218
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,275
You are a fantastic waitress. l do not
want to do anything to lose you.

219
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,989
Don't say another word.
l understand you completely.

220
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,310
- You do?
- Of course.

221
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,758
Thank you. l just wanted
to get your approval first.

222
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,914
Sam, how can you be so civilised
when your very blood is boiling?

223
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,797
Don't you think l haven't been feeling
the same urges?

224
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,636
Don't you think l haven't felt
the same unconquerable chemistry?

225
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,828
Denying ourselves has been as
treacherous for me as it has for you.

226
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,157
- That is what you meant, isn't it?
- You bet.

227
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,279
No. This whole thing just kind of snuck up
on me, that's all.

228
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,350
Well, l won't pretend this hasn't
happened to me before.

229
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,036
Spend any amount of time in a man's
presence and l send out a sort of...

230
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,228
...well, let's face it...erotic signals.

231
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,238
Would you wait here for just a minute?

232
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,356
l need to talk to Carla.

233
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,879
Carla is the person that l usually...
Trust me.

234
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,634
Sam, are you ready
to take me down to that Cape?

235
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,193
- Just one minute.
- What happened? l know it's bad.

236
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,558
Lillian thought l wanted to go out with
her. She's got third-degree Sammies.

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,635
- l knew it.
- Don't panic. l can handle this.

238
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,349
We need a solution.
l can always fall back on the truth.

239
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,992
You can't do that. lf you tell her you're
not interested now, she's going to quit.

240
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,993
lf she gets hurt and quits,
l'll be hurt and quit.

241
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,948
lf l get hurt and quit,
then you'll be as good as dead.

242
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,396
What am l going to do?
My mind doesn't work like this.

243
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,074
lt's trained to get women into bed.

244
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,997
- What would Diane do?
- Talk till we puke.

245
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,594
Probably.

246
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,834
l got it. Lillian is smarter than us, right?

247
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,473
You go in there and tell her, ''Lillian, we
can't do this, because...well, you know.''

248
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,155
- No.
- That's what you say.

249
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,630
- She'll fill in the rest.
- That's brilliant.

250
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,758
How does the part go
that l say again? Come on.

251
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,071
''We can't do this,
because...well, you know.''

252
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,789
No, l don't. l wouldn't be asking you
to repeat it if l did.

253
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,877
Right. That's perfect.

254
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,870
Sam, my dear, you're damp.

255
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,713
lt's the sweat of passion.

256
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,919
Lillian, we can't do this because...

257
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,234
...well, you know.

258
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,520
- Yes, l suppose l do.
- You do?

259
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,637
- Sam, why are you dancing?
- l'm just...

260
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,715
l was relieved that l wasn't the only one
who knew why we couldn't do this.

261
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,997
l love this job. l need this job.

262
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,995
Carla needs me so much.
l would miss all these wonderful people.

263
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,837
We must preserve a proper working
relationship no matter what the pain.

264
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,433
lt's sad. l mean, it's so very sad.

265
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,558
Buck up, Sam.
l'm sure it's all for the best.

266
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,076
You're young and not so schooled
in the ways of love as l.

267
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,315
Such a coupling could be fatal. l've
already had two husbands die in bed.

268
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,277
l'm sorry. What did they die of?

269
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,351
You child.

270
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,712
Really?

271
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,391
Yes, they fainted, which all my men do.
But they never came to.

272
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,993
They fainted?
You're saying that that's normal?

273
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,358
Well, l don't want to gloat,
but yes, it has been known.

274
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,958
Were these healthy guys to begin with?

275
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,238
They weren't athletes such as yourself,
but they certainly weren't weaklings.

276
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,789
Why do you ask?

277
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,838
l was just thinking that maybe...

278
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,917
No, you're absolutely right.
Back to work.

279
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,230
We must get back to work, Sam.

280
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,516
l don't want to beat this to death,

281
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,515
but when these guys went,
were they smiling?

282
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,715
Ear to ear.

283
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,159
- And that was the grumpy one.
- l'll be darned.

284
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,799
- So, what happened?
- Everything's OK. l guess.

285
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,555
Sam, are we ever
going to get to this Cape?

286
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,238
Right.

287
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,755
You're taking my daughter sightseeing?

288
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,870
- lf it's OK with you?
- l think it's an absolutely wonderful idea.

289
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,509
Besides, it will take your mind off
what you really want.

290
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,989
Yeah, maybe.

291
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,917
Well, Carolyn, it's just you and me
off to that famous Cape. Here we go.

292
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,870
Do you mind if l ask you
kind of a personal question here?

293
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,996
What's that?

294
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,038
Could you tell me,
how did your father die?

295
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,353
The coroner said it was a heart attack.

296
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,672
But we all know it was
Mummy's passion that killed him.

297
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,873
Well, that's tragic.

298
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,113
Yes. l suppose that's why l hate sex so.

299
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,718
The very idea gives me the chills.

300
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,189
Well, let's go.

301
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,669
Didn't you...
