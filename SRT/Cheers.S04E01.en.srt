1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,394
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,430
- Carla, give me a beer.
- Right.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,989
What's the story with Sam?
Isn't he back from ltaly yet?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,152
No. Three whole days,
and we haven't heard a word.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,959
He just went there to stop Diane
and Frasier from getting married.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,031
Don't know what could
be taking him so long.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,509
Maybe Frasier's still thanking him.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,636
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Diane
now had a "Malone" after her name.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,434
Well, could be, Cliffie.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,034
That ltaly's an awfully darn
romantic place.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,111
I almost went there myself
on my honeymoon.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,955
Had the plane reservations
and the hotel reservations. Everything.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,553
Well, what stopped you, Norm?

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,712
Oh, Vera.
You know, she insisted on coming.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,389
I bet you wanna know
how it went in ltaly.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,833
No, no, not really.
How about you, Cliffie?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,956
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,476
Got off the plane and I took a cab
to the Marino estate,

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,313
where I had been told
they were gonna get married.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,109
But they wouldn't let me in,
so I jumped over the fence

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,159
and landed in the middle
of seven snarling rottweilers.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,153
Rottweilers. It comes from
the German word "Rott--"

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,959
- Cliff, shut up.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,398
Luckily, I outsmarted the dogs
by diving into a moat.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,554
While the police were fishing me out,
I discovered that Diane and Frasier

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,756
had decided to get married
someplace else.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,956
This was right before
they threw me in jail.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,716
Jail? How'd you get out?

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,192
Well, a local landowner
bailed me out.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,309
Actually, he didn't bail me out.
There's a different system over there.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,799
He purchased me.

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,359
Seems... Seems his ox died
or something.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,796
I really don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,831
I'm gonna be in my office.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,159
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
I am through with that woman forever.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,074
I will never think about, see
or mention her ever again.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,358
And if anyone even uses
the words "Diane Chambers,"

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,080
I will have no other choice
but to kill that person.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,076
Wow. Poor guy.
Who is this Diane Chambers anyhow?

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,711
Who said that?

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,033
No!. No!. No!.

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,273
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,114
What do you say, Norm?

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,078
Any cheap, tawdry thing
that'll get me a beer.

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,758
- Hey, Norman.
- You seem pretty chipper today.

46
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,673
A few notches up
from your usual abysmal.

47
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,912
Well, thank you, Cliffie. That's because
I have a little bit of good news here.

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,638
- What's that?
- You know how I've been

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,110
trying to get Vera pregnant?
Congratulate me.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,392
- Hey!
- Have a cigar.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,438
Whoa. Well, I think this calls
for some champagne here.

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,034
- Well, thank you, Sam.
- What sex do you want it to be?

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,839
Sex? Come on, I thought you just
asked for the vintage. You know?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,356
Wait, wait. I see your mistake.
Vera's not with child.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,592
She just told me I didn't have to
try to get her pregnant anymore.

56
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,954
Let's celebrate! Come on! Party!

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,355
This is amazing.

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,436
Hundreds of bottles.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Red and white wine glasses.

60
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,278
High-grade Naugahyde stool covers.

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,396
And a brass rail.

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,314
And a big-city bartender
with a joke at the ready.

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,230
You from out of town?

64
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,916
Okay, I'll bite.
Yeah, I'm from out of town.

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,599
Can I help you?

66
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,229
Well, that went right over my head.

67
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,919
- Excuse me, my name's Woody Boyd.
- Woody. Hi, I'm Sam Malone.

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,548
Howdy. I'm a friend of Coach's.
Is he around?

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,757
I'm sorry, Woody.
I guess you hadn't heard.

70
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,514
No, Coach passed away
a couple of months ago.

71
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,148
But, yeah, I'd like to think
he's still around.

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,554
Coach, gone. I can hardly believe it.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,752
Well, he had a lot of friends.
I don't--

74
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,070
I don't remember him
mentioning a Woody.

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,949
Well, we never met.
We were kind of like pen pals.

76
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,998
You exchanged letters?

77
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,798
No, pens.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,831
It was Coach's idea.

79
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,918
Oh, well, that figures.

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,513
Can I get you something
to drink here?

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,954
Well, a soda pop would be good.

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,553
Soda pop.
All right, all right.

83
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,109
See, I got in the habit of writing
to the bars in the big city,

84
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,032
in the hopes of landing a job,

85
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,159
and once I wrote a letter to Cheers,
and Coach answered my letter.

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,276
I liked him right away.

87
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,113
Maybe it was because he was
the only one who wrote back to me.

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,836
Woody, did you say you
were looking for work?

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,397
Well, actually, I came to Boston
on a fact-finding tour.

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,790
See, I tend bar
back home in lndiana.

91
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,509
Well, it's not a bar exactly.
It's more like...

92
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,434
...a pigsty with a jukebox,

93
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,238
if we had a jukebox.

94
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,078
Carla.

95
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,399
I'd like you to meet Woody Boyd.
Woody, this is Carla Tortelli.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,312
- Hi, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,750
What's that supposed to mean?

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,031
I believe it's a term of respect.

99
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,829
No wonder it sounded so weird.
Who is this guy?

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,515
Well, he's a friend of Coach's,
and he's looking for work.

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,352
What do you think?
You wanna give him a try?

102
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,359
Me?

103
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,234
Mr Malone, this is
the proudest day of my life!

104
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,195
I'd work like a slave and I wouldn't take
anything more than minimum wage.

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,828
And, of course, I'd wash your car.

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,715
And if you ever need someone
to just, you know, yell at,

107
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,833
I'm your man.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,154
I think we better keep him, Sam.
He wouldn't be safe on the streets.

109
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,033
- Thanks, Carla.
- What the hell.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,156
Woody, come on around here
and we'll check you out.

111
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,471
You won't regret it, Mr Malone.
I love bartending.

112
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,030
You get behind a bar, and right away
strangers are your best friends.

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,876
They call you great names, like
"buddy" and "pal" and "chief" and "ace."

114
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,268
Here's your apron, sport.

115
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,874
Sport! Another great one!

116
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,995
But listen, let me make
one thing clear.

117
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,230
One mistake, and I'm out on my butt.

118
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,472
Hey, Cliffie, next time you try
to imitate that helicopter,

119
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,712
I think you ought to chalk up the cues
before you stick them in your ears.

120
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,190
You kidding, Norm? I'd look
pretty silly with chalk in my ears.

121
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,272
Cliff, Norm, Woody Boyd. Woody's
gonna be helping us out around here.

122
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,475
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

123
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,557
- All right.
- What's your pleasure, gents?

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,914
Make it anything you want.

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,719
Now, where I come from,
all anyone ever drinks is beer.

126
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,599
Beer's fine, but any monkey
can pull down a tap.

127
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,035
Why study years
to be an ace mixologist

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,191
just to serve beer
after beer after beer?

129
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,869
So, what will it be?

130
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,672
Beer.

131
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,233
Same.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,310
So while it's a common belief
that the Tyrannosaurus rex

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,277
was the king of the dinosaurs,

134
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,512
you know, as a-- As indicated
by the appellative "-saurus,"

135
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,228
the smartest of the spiny reptiles
was actually the thyropatroid.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,117
Frasier W. Crane.

137
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,192
Oh, the man who won the hand
of Diane Chambers.

138
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,874
Found out he had to keep
the rest of her.

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,429
Hello, Carla, Norm, Cliff.
It's been a long time.

140
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,479
Yeah, we got a lot of catching up to do.
So, what's new?

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,672
- I couldn't begin to tell you.
- Okay, well, that's even better.

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,952
What's your pleasure?

143
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,190
My life is devoid of pleasure.

144
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,149
You need a good laugh.
Are you from out of town?

145
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,273
Just give me a whiskey, punk.

146
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,069
Punk! Oh, that's great!

147
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,679
Where's Malone?

148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,593
I mean, where's
my good friend Sam?

149
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,349
Mr Malone's in his office.
You want me to give him a buzz?

150
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,590
No, no, I'll surprise him.

151
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,673
Oh, by the way, any peculiar noises
you hear coming out of that room,

152
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,114
don't let it bother you.

153
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,558
It's just a couple of old friends
having a little fun together.

154
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,110
Yo. I think my joke
loosened him up a little.

155
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,198
Hello, Sam, old buddy.

156
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,195
Frasier. What the hell
are you doing here?

157
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,437
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I'm alone.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,438
I didn't marry Diane.

159
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,389
You didn't?

160
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,279
No, I didn't.
Does that make you happy?

161
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,919
Well, I'm happy for you.

162
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,878
Just how'd you manage that?

163
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,315
Well, she left me at the altar.

164
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,391
I had just vowed to take her
for my wife.

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,790
The priest asked her
if she would marry me.

166
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,077
She looked around and asked
if he was talking to her.

167
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,271
He nodded, and she was gone.

168
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,393
Gee, Fras, that's tough.

169
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,949
She just took off, huh?
No explanation or anything?

170
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,833
Well, there was no
explanation necessary.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,638
It was you she loved all along.

172
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,354
And it was the thought of you
that made me lose her.

173
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,718
The story of my humiliation spread
like wildfire through the university

174
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,792
and then to the entire
ltalian countryside.

175
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,592
Everyone knew about it.
Everyone knew about my shame.

176
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,149
- You must have been imagining that.
- Oh, was l?

177
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,478
Do you know that in soccer,

178
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,035
when a player kicks at the ball,
misses and falls down,

179
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,918
it's now called a "Frasier"?

180
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,791
That could be a coincidence.

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,269
If he's knocked cold,
it's called a "Frasier Crane."

182
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,600
I've lost everything, Malone.

183
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,553
My tenure, my practice
and my Diane.

184
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,150
My life is ruined,
and it's all your fault.

185
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,835
Now, don't you think someone
should pay for that?

186
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,918
If by "someone," you mean
someone in this room, I can...

187
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
I can honestly answer no, I don't.

188
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,828
Oh, come on.

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,557
Oh, wait-- What are you doing?
The gun's not even loaded.

190
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,676
- Certainly it's loaded.
- No, it isn't.

191
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,596
Of course you know it's not, because
Frasier Crane is a harmless person.

192
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,559
He never caused you a moment's
concern, not a moment's worry.

193
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,870
He was never a threat to
your relationship with Diane,

194
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,508
and he's not a threat now.
Is that it, Sam?

195
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,793
No, it's just the little holes
there are empty.

196
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,952
Once again,
you're ahead of me, Sam.

197
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,437
I just hoped to see you quaking in
your boots a little bit or something,

198
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,113
but you've cheated me even of that.

199
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,829
Boy. Boy, you're really bent
out of shape over this, aren't you?

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,870
Just out of totally idle curiosity,
whatever did happen to Diane?

201
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,069
Well, I was recently informed
by my mentor, Dr Bennett Ludlow,

202
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,629
whose care I'm now under,
incidentally.

203
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,475
And believe me,
he's doing a heck of a job.

204
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,116
He told me that she's at
St. Anselm's Abbey,

205
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,600
an hour outside of Boston,
with the Sisters of the Divine Severity.

206
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,474
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.
You can't be a nun if you've already--

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,359
Oh, she's not becoming a nun,
you idiot!

208
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,274
She's working there. She's cleaning,
serving meals, wearing sackcloth,

209
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,351
- that sort of thing.
- I'll be damned.

210
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,556
You see, after she left me,

211
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,508
Diane embarked upon
a spree of decadence in ltaly.

212
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,954
I'd hear stories about dancing
on tables in cafés,

213
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,069
swimming in public fountains,

214
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,789
cavorting with counts
and soccer players.

215
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,348
Well, now she's doing penance
for la dolce vita.

216
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,195
She's seeking peace.
I hope she's found it.

217
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,159
Diane, dancing on tabletops?

218
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,676
You mean my--? Your--? Our--?
The Diane?

219
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,076
Yes, all of them.

220
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,876
But now listen, Sam,

221
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,792
- you won't go and see her will you?
- No!

222
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,837
I mean, it would be
disaster for everyone.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,833
No, no.
Believe me, I wouldn't do that.

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,638
No, I'm over her.

225
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,995
You know, and if you know
what's good for you,

226
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,196
I think you should forget
about her too.

227
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,475
Oh, I'll forget about her.

228
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,676
I'll forget about her
when the moon turns to ashes

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,592
and the birds sing nevermore.

230
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,318
There you go.

231
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,430
Well, I'm sorry about
the histrionics, Sam.

232
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,431
- Oh, no, don't.
- You know, it's funny,

233
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,673
even through all this,
I still think of you as my goombah.

234
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,394
Well, it's best that I get going.

235
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,596
But let's do the lunch thing
sometime.

236
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,114
I'd like that. Yeah. Take care.

237
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,033
You won't go see her?

238
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,553
No way. No.

239
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,436
- Hi, Diane.
- Hi, Sam.

240
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,471
Calm-- Calm down, here.

241
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,995
I just popped in to say howdy.

242
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,277
Are you okay?

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,555
What the hell--? Heck...

244
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,434
...are you doing here?

245
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,599
I bumped into Frasier, and he told me
that you checked into a convent,

246
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,433
and I was afraid
you got all squirrelly again.

247
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,474
Thank you for your
carefully worded concern,

248
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,518
- Well, now, you know--
- but I assure you, I am fine.

249
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,159
Oh, Sam, I was so sorry
to hear about the Coach.

250
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,118
Yeah, I know, I know.

251
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,474
Not a day goes by when
I don't miss him terribly.

252
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,119
Me too.

253
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,039
You know what helps me, though,

254
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,078
is I always remember what
he used to say about the afterlife,

255
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,470
"l hope there are not a lot of stairs."

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,434
- It's wise in its way.
- Yeah.

257
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,558
Sam, you're really gonna have
to leave. It's wrong for you to be here.

258
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,157
All right, but there's something
I gotta say first, though.

259
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,788
All right, fine. But if they find you,
it's your problem.

260
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,837
- All right.
- I'm not covering for you.

261
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,876
Sister Catherine!

262
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,111
Have you met the rice inspector?

263
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,590
The rice inspector sent
by the archdiocese

264
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,638
to inspect the rice,
which is what they do.

265
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,755
Ah, yes, very good.

266
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,710
Sam, what is it? Tell me what you
have to say and then leave, please.

267
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,599
Listen, I want you
to come back to Cheers.

268
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,069
I don't think you belong here, Diane.

269
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,597
No, Sam, I do belong here.

270
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,911
Although I'm not of their order,
the sisters took me in,

271
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,516
and working here among them

272
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,672
has helped me find the peace
that had so eluded me.

273
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,668
Besides, if I came back to Cheers,
it would lead

274
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,229
to nothing but terrible problems
between you and me.

275
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,231
No, no, it's not like that anymore.

276
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,995
Because all I feel for you
is the concern of a friend.

277
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,835
The same way I would for, say,
Norm or a dog.

278
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,638
You say that,

279
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,510
but you know our passions
always overcome our intentions.

280
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,912
We say it's over, and yet we still
end up in each other's arms,

281
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,555
hugging, then kissing,

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,070
perhaps lightly at first...

283
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,154
...but then with open mouths...

284
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,075
...hungry, probing tongues...

285
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,837
Go on, please.

286
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,989
I appreciate the offer, Sam,
but I'm needed here,

287
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,190
and I need to be here
and I need to be needed here.

288
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,589
- You really mean this, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

289
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,038
Well, I guess that's what matters.

290
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,756
I guess I better be going.

291
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,592
I recognised one of the ladies,

292
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,070
and I think that I'm the reason
why she's here in the first place.

293
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,350
I'm glad I got to see you.

294
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,791
Yeah, I'm glad I came.

295
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,118
Turned out kind of nice, huh?

296
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,713
Yes, it was good.

297
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,110
I'm glad we had a chance
to end it this way.

298
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,714
Cleanly, spiritually.

299
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,795
Free of rancour and sexual tens--
Tens-- Tension.

300
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,473
Whatever.

301
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,074
- Well, this is where it ends, huh?
- Yeah.

302
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,359
Goodbye.

303
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,229
Goodbye.

304
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,278
I swore I'd never tell you this ever,

305
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,115
but I guess maybe because we're
never gonna see each other again...

306
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,353
You know, you always used to accuse
me of being an unromantic slob,

307
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,910
but you wanna know the truth?
When you called me

308
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,150
to tell me that you
were marrying Frasier,

309
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,517
I flew on a plane to ltaly
to stop the wedding.

310
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,069
I guess I thought I was
in love with you

311
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,994
and that you and l
should be married.

312
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,031
Not that I feel that way now.

313
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,160
But, well, I just thought
you ought to know that.

314
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,629
Have a good life. Bye.

315
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,868
Good evening.

316
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,712
Good-- Good evening, Sister Marie.

317
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,519
I heard that the rice inspector
was here.

318
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,712
He wasn't the rice inspector.
He was a man from my past.

319
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,713
Say no more.
There's no need to explain.

320
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,350
- I feel I must.
- I knew you would.

321
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,518
He wanted me to return to the outside,
to the life I used to know.

322
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,359
By the way, I hope you like this.
I got a little creative tonight.

323
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,637
- Oh, yet again.
- Taste it.

324
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,274
At any rate, I told him that
I wasn't going to leave,

325
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,590
that I'm needed too much here.

326
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,189
Do you think I am, Sister?
I mean, I feel that I'm ready now

327
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,309
to leave, to get on with my life,
but I feel so safe here.

328
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,708
What do you think?

329
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,591
Put your faith in God.

330
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,750
I know I'm going to.

331
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,870
Time to do the floors.

332
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,629
These ladies can be so messy.

333
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,557
Rice everywhere.

334
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,191
I haven't done this
since I was a child...

335
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,311
...but when in Rome...

336
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,396
Now, I know there are far greater
problems in the world than mine,

337
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,590
but I'm feeling as though
I'm at a crossroads.

338
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,148
And I was wondering
if you could give me a little sign...

339
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,079
...to tell me what to do.

340
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,393
Excuse me. Hi.

341
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,077
You wouldn't know where a men's
room was around here, would you?

342
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,118
Sam, would you put a men's room
in a convent?

343
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,715
Right now I would, yes.

344
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,873
Just any sign. Something--

345
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,876
Oh! Oh!

346
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,030
Well...

347
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,433
...it's not the parting of the Red Sea.

348
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,478
That's nitpicking.
