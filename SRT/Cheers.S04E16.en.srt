1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,599
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,633
Cheers.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,951
Yes, ma'am, right away.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,872
There's some lady
screaming her head off.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,195
What does she want?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,436
I don't know.
All I could make out was "two-timing."

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,195
Sam, telephone.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,796
Woody, listen up
and learn something.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,590
Sammy here.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,391
Oh, hey, I thought you'd like
those flowers.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,313
Yeah. No, no,
that sounds like my note.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,790
"Thanks for a wonderful evening,
Barbara. I had a great time."

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,668
Well, of course I know
your name's Karen.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,513
You know, hey,
I see your mistake here.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,391
You see, you didn't realise that,
to me, Barbara means Karen.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,515
Well, because. Because...

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,276
Because "Barbara" reminds me
of Barbra Streisand,

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,989
and you know that song
about people?

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,074
Well, I am getting to it.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,954
You know the line, "First be a person
who needs people"?

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,270
Well, who was the first person?

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,557
Yeah, all right, but the first
female person was Eve.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,995
And who's the most
famous Eve of all,

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,196
but Christmas Eve, right?

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,151
Yeah, well, what do you do on
Christmas Eve, but you go carolling.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,278
Right? No, I know,
your name's not Carolyn.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,510
But after you go carolling,

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,071
what you do is, you Karen the gifts.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,469
Karen. Yeah.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,872
Well, apology accepted, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you later.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,629
Hello, everybody.

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,155
- Hey.
- Clifford.

33
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,354
Well, Cliff Clavin is here
to bid you all glad tidings

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,988
and buy drinks for all my friends.

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,196
All right. What's the occasion, Cliffie?
New air-cushion insoles or something?

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,915
No, no, no.
Better than that, Normie.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,152
My branch office voted me
Postman of the Year.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,551
It's a very prestigious award too.

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,599
Only 267 given out in
the greater Boston area.

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,757
- We're very proud of you.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,512
Will there be a ceremony?

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,954
Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah.

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,675
As is traditional, to be held
at the gala Postman's Ball.

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah, unfortunately it's not
gonna be televised.

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,157
I hear it's blacked out
in this area anyway, so...

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,992
But I understand the postmaster
general is gonna make the toast.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,557
Wow, a man of his position
helping out in the kitchen.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,830
Only in America.

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,237
Excuse me, Diane?
Can I have a word with you?

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,435
Of course.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,679
"l, Cliff Clavin, would be ever
so honoured if you,

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,035
a lady of exquisite
loveliness and taste,

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,318
whom I hold in the highest respect
and esteem,

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,512
would accompany me with your
presence at the gala Postman's Ball

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,029
on the 1 8th of this month.

56
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,072
You would be doing this
only as a friend.

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,511
There is no ulterior motive
or strings attached.

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,830
Thank you for listening."

59
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,715
- Cliff, I'd love to.
- You would?

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,718
Yes, but I have something else
planned that night.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,839
It's all right. You know, just asked
on the spur of the moment.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,953
I'm sorry, Cliff.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,519
- No.
- I mean it. I am.

64
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,036
- Oh, poor Cliff.
- Why? What happened?

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,998
Well, he asked me to his
Postman's Ball,

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,670
and I had to tell him I already had
plans for that evening.

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,108
What plans?

68
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,754
My cheese club meets that night.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,189
So you're gonna eat cheese
instead of helping Cliff out on this?

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,635
We don't only eat cheese.
We talk about eating cheese.

71
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,749
Come on. Obviously, it means
a lot to him.

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,275
All he wants to do is be seen
with a classy-looking chick.

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,914
Oh, I don't know, Sam.

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,516
Look at all the people who've
fallen hopelessly in love with me,

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,036
with only the slightest
encouragement.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,589
- You, Frasier...
- Yourself.

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,519
- Well, perhaps I was being selfish.
- There you go.

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,910
- I'll talk to Cliff the first chance I get.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,317
Diane was crushed when she found
she couldn't go to the ball with me.

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,192
Well, what are you gonna do now,
Mr Clavin?

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,789
I'll just have to ask Carla.

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,636
Are you nuts?

83
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,631
Carla won't go with you.
She despises you.

84
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,671
Well, just because she despises me,

85
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,958
doesn't mean she can't spend an
evening dining and dancing with me.

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,110
Carla...could I ask you a favour?

87
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,998
What?

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,433
- Can we talk in the poolroom?
- No.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,599
Carla, that wasn't the favour.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,555
There's more?

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,199
What I have to endure.

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,109
Now for the kill.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,317
Carla, "l, Cliff Clavin,

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,989
would be ever so honoured
if you, a lady of--

95
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,913
A lady...

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,318
...would accompany me
with your presence

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,914
at the gala Postman's Ball
on the 18th of this month.

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,032
You would be doing this
only as a friend.

99
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,755
There is no ulterior motive
or strings attached.

100
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,433
Thank you for listening."

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,792
Carla...

102
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,078
Carla...

103
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,792
Carla, this is
really important to me.

104
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,636
I know.

105
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,916
But think of me.

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,991
All right, look, Carla, you don't have to
dance with me and I'll buy you a dress.

107
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,756
- Nah.
- A corsage.

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,990
A hundred bucks.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,911
- Nah.
- A VCR.

110
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,830
VCR?

111
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,751
Nice touch, but I'll have to pass.

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,159
Good Lord. Is that a tear?

113
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,189
Look, I think my greed is overcoming
your repulsiveness.

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,790
- I'll go.
- You'll go?

115
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,678
- Oh, Carla--
- First rule:

116
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,394
No physical contact of any kind.

117
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,797
But, Carla, I'm so happy,
I gotta hug something.

118
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,388
Okay, you can hug me for 5 bucks.

119
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,678
That's it.

120
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,997
My pleasure.

121
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,432
Well, got a date with Carla.

122
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,119
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding?

123
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,670
She fell for me
like a sack of cannolis.

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,434
Yeah, you gotta love them,
the little wenches.

125
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,439
Oh, Clifford, may I speak with you
for a moment?

126
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,352
Yeah, certainly, Diane.

127
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,676
I've been thinking about it,

128
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,791
and I've decided
to break my engagement

129
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,394
and join you in your evening
of triumph.

130
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,710
- You'll go with me?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,356
Normie, Normie, did you hear that?
Diane will go to the ball with me.

132
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,830
- I'm taking Diane to the ball!
- Cliff, Cliff.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,878
Think just a minute, now.
What's wrong with this picture?

134
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,634
Sam, change for a 20?

135
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,995
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,114
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

137
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,358
Well, I'll just have to have
a huddle here with the man

138
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,990
who knows almost as much
about women as I do.

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,431
- Sammy?
- Yeah?

140
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,716
- A word, if you will.
- What's up?

141
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,388
Well, I seem to have one
of those situations again.

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,472
You know, two dollies lined up
for the same evening.

143
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,229
Oh, well, does this have to do with
Diane, Carla and that postman thing?

144
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,188
- Yeah.
- Well, fair's fair. Who said yes first?

145
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,069
Carla.

146
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,510
Well, you just have to tell Diane
you can't go with her.

147
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,073
Make up some excuse.

148
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,589
Tell her that your girl cousin
from Michigan

149
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,558
is in town just for the day
and that you gotta take her.

150
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,239
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

151
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,595
No, she's already heard that one.

152
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,632
Clifford, I've been thinking.

153
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,793
Oh, yeah, you can't go, huh, Diane?
Hey, I understand.

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,152
Honestly, you're so insecure.

155
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,869
I was going to say that I thought
of the perfect dress to wear.

156
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,834
Sassy little strapless number,
very graceful for dancing.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,514
With my hair up and a hint of jewellery
to catch the eye.

158
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,713
I'm going to make you very proud.

159
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,676
Now what, Sammy?

160
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,319
Yeah, this is a tough one.

161
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,074
Yeah, if Carla finds out
you asked Diane first,

162
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,196
you're gonna be dead
before you hit the ground.

163
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,548
Hey, hold on a minute.

164
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,035
All you gotta do is,
you gotta find Carla another date.

165
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,599
Someone better than you.

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,268
Hey, Sammy, Sammy,
you are a genius.

167
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,432
Well, thank you. Oh, yeah, listen.

168
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,717
When you talk to her about the guy,
be vague. Be general.

169
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,757
Don't get locked into
anybody specific.

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,831
All right. Vague. General.

171
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,077
Carla?

172
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,198
How'd you like to go to
the Postman's Ball

173
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,432
with a guy who looks like
Robert Redford and drives a Porsche?

174
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,073
Why aren't I going with you?

175
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,590
Well, see, there's this buddy of mine
down at the P.O.

176
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,877
You might have seen him in here.
He's been in a couple of times.

177
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,953
Well, son of a gun if he didn't say
he's got a big crush on you,

178
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,598
and, well, he wanted me to see
if you'd go to the ball with him. Now--

179
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,509
This isn't just some way of getting
out of giving me the VCR, is it?

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,429
No! No, no, no.
You'll get everything I promised.

181
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,549
Plus the bonus of not having
to go out with you,

182
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,838
which leads me to believe that this
guy is a bigger loser than you are.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,197
Just forget it, Clavin!
What kind of girl do you think I am?

184
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,353
One who would like
a big-screen TV?

185
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,999
That's the kind.

186
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,590
Hello, everyone.

187
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,315
Good heavens.

188
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,277
- Miss Chambers, you look beautiful.
- Yeah.

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,358
- Thank you, Woody.
- Doesn't she? Boy, you know,

190
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,035
that just opens up the floodgates
to a lot of memories.

191
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,553
Why, thank you, Sam, but I don't
remember us ever going

192
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,950
to a formal occasion
while we were dating.

193
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,232
No, I was thinking about the girl
I took to my high school prom.

194
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,236
Just kidding. Just kidding.

195
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,956
Miss Chambers,
can I tell you something?

196
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,957
Sure, Woody.

197
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,236
You look like a hundred bucks.

198
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,713
Thank you, Woody.

199
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,876
Oh, what am I saying?
Two hundred.

200
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,476
Woody, you're turning my head.

201
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,473
Okay, a hundred.

202
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,591
Oh, look out.
Here comes your boyfriend.

203
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,516
Everybody, I'd like you to meet Lucas.
Lucas, the gang.

204
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,034
Right. He said hello. You see, Lucas
is sort of used to talking to himself.

205
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,478
Lucas, you wanna step on down to
the bar and have something to drink?

206
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,393
- Oh, Diane, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

207
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,071
Oh, this is for you.
Just a little token of my affection.

208
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,990
Thank you, Clifford.

209
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,832
If you don't mind my asking, who is
this Lucas fellow, and why is he here?

210
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh, well, we're gonna double
with him and his date...

211
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,919
...Carla.

212
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,913
Carla? Well, I guess
they're a match.

213
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,311
Although he does look like he's
been around a mushroom or two.

214
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,193
Oh, Cliff.

215
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,311
Gee, this is...

216
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,433
...big.

217
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,514
Big and beautiful.

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,716
Yeah, why don't you try it on.

219
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,869
Oh, no, no, something this big
and beautiful should be preserved.

220
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,513
Oh, don't worry about that, Diane.

221
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,194
That's guaranteed to last
through a 20-knot wind.

222
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,838
Sorry I'm late.
The baby spit up on my dress.

223
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,318
I had to buy a brooch
big enough to cover it.

224
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,189
Real diamond chips.
Seventy-five bucks.

225
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,039
What is whitey doing here
dressed like that?

226
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,438
Diane's the only date I could
scrape up at the last minute.

227
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,110
Oh, yeah?
What are you paying her?

228
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,989
- Transistor radio.
- A cheap date. I knew it.

229
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,672
Carla, don't you wanna
meet your date?

230
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,239
I thought he was supposed to look
like Robert Redford.

231
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,757
Well, he does from a distance.

232
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,953
Yeah, Mars.

233
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,477
And I think you'll soon find out
just why a planet came to mind.

234
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,396
Carla, I'd like you to meet Lucas.
Lucas, your date, Carla.

235
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,674
What did he say?

236
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,432
I can't believe it matters.

237
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,836
Well, I can see this is gonna be
a laugh a minute.

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,630
An evening with the stick, the nerd
and door number three.

239
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,593
You kids have a great time.

240
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,992
Good night.

241
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,589
Jimmy! Yo!

242
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,591
Well, you two seem to be
getting on pretty well.

243
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,675
Yeah, well, I sure hate to have
to admit this, Clavin,

244
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,593
but tall, dark and gruesome here...

245
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,432
...turned out to be a real groove.

246
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,313
Not a great dancer, though.
He mashed in the toes of my shoes.

247
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,913
I'll bill you for a new pair.

248
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,953
I don't believe this.
You should be buying me a VCR.

249
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,035
Just wait a minute. You're not gonna
welsh on our deal, are you?

250
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,913
Carla, come on, will you?
You're making out like a bandit here.

251
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,510
At least you're getting
some loving tonight.

252
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,395
Boy, I made the wrong choice
between you and Diane.

253
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,468
What did you say?

254
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,878
I said you and Diane
look really choice tonight.

255
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,159
I see. So where is the stick anyway?

256
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,592
She's just going to freshen up.
She'll be out in a couple of minutes.

257
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,911
You know, I never would have
thought it. You two.

258
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,076
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,232
Look, I shouldn't be telling you this,

260
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,994
but when you two guys
went to get some punch,

261
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,073
Diane told me that she wished
you'd come on a little stronger.

262
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,471
In fact, she said that she wished

263
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,315
that you would do the one thing to her
that no man has ever done.

264
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,913
I mean, not even Sammy.

265
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,914
- The one thing that makes her crazy.
- What? What?

266
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,669
Just out of curiosity.

267
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,753
Run your fingers
up and down her arm,

268
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,549
Iook into her eyes and sing "Misty."

269
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,918
Sorry to hold you up.

270
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,992
Well, let's be on our way, Clifford.

271
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,959
Clifford, I want you to know
that I liked your speech best.

272
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,630
Out of all 267.

273
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,518
- Really?
- Absolutely.

274
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,510
Listen, Diane, I want to thank you
for keeping up the act tonight.

275
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,193
You know, staying by my side.

276
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,157
It wasn't entirely an act, Cliff.

277
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,149
I think tonight was the first time
I saw you with your guard down.

278
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,438
You were yourself, not some
mutation of Sam Malone,

279
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,957
trying to impress people
with tales of sexual exploits.

280
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,917
Women don't really like that, Cliff.

281
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,639
They want men to be
sweet and vulnerable.

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,355
Then how come Sammy
always scores?

283
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,596
Because he's gorgeous.

284
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,953
I mean, he has low standards.

285
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,953
He'll go out with any floozy
who comes down the pike.

286
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,793
Speaking of pike,
how come we're not on it?

287
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,077
Well, I wanted to take
the long way home.

288
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,832
Yeah...

289
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,153
...I just had the time
of my life tonight,

290
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,912
and I don't want it to end.

291
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,310
I just want to feel the night wind
in my hair

292
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,199
and share the company
of you good people.

293
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,314
I think it's wonderful, Cliff.

294
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,598
Yeah, I think tonight was
a real breakthrough for you.

295
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,435
Perhaps we've seen the end of the old
insecure, arrested adolescent...

296
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,196
...and we're seeing the emergence
of the real Cliff Clavin.

297
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,468
- What?
- Darn.

298
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,996
- What? What's wrong?
- We ran out of gas.

299
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,475
Well, the gauge reads half full.

300
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,996
Yeah, yeah, it always reads half full.
It's stuck there.

301
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,438
I guess in the excitement of the night,
I just forgot to fill the tank.

302
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,670
Well, what are we going to do?

303
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,879
We're miles from a gas station.

304
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,188
Look at me

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,437
I'm as helpless as a kitten in a tree

306
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,955
And I'm clinging to a cloud

307
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,357
I can't understand

308
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,670
I get misty

309
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,909
Just holding your hand

310
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,440
Walk my way

311
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,591
Get out.

312
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,157
- And a thousand vio--
- Now.

313
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,997
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,830
Diane, look, I'm sorry.
You don't understand.

315
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,275
I don't know what happened
to me tonight.

316
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,635
The wine must have
gone to my head, Diane.

317
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,360
Look, you know I hold you
in the highest respect and esteem,

318
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,672
and I would never, ever do anything
to upset you.

319
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,718
Well, running out of gas? Really!

320
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,714
- Well, we did run out of gas, Diane.
- Clifford.

321
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,795
Well, look, would a sign
from God convince you?

322
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,077
Maybe.

323
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,675
All right.

324
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,395
Almighty God...

325
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,111
...please, if I'm telling the truth about
this car running out of gas tonight,

326
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,632
Iet it start now, even on an empty tank.

327
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,998
Diane, hallelujah!

328
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,473
Oh, hallelujah! Diane! Oh, hey!
