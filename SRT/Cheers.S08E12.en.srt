 to take me to go get my car

Right after

All right,                  
    i can drive you, miss howe.

14
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,213
Good.

15
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,981
But--but after that,   
         if there's time,       
         could i take off?

[Sighing]      
                 god, woody.

17
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:39,403
What is                 
        so all-fired important  
        about your stupid life?

18
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,774
Well, i cook               
     and deliver meals          
     to elderly shut-ins.

19
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,841
Oh.

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,362
You know,               
        i--i normally do it     
        on my day off,

21
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,796
but this week          
         on my day off

22
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,650
i'm doing a walkathon      
     for illiteracy.

23

We're against it.

24
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,322
Well, ok, then that would  
     be all right, woody.

25
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:01,242
Oh, oh, miss howe, wait.       
 I'm recycling glass bottles.

26
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,779
I want this world to be clean  
 for our children.

27
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,849
I mean, my children.    
        Or your children.

Or our children.

29
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:14,822
Seeing as how you got a date   
 with someone else tonight,

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,824
it seems like a long shot.

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,113
Woody, you're so good  
         and i'm so bad.

32
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:25,917
I--i feel guilty and ashamed.  
 I mean, i feel like            
 killing myself.

33
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,836

 of the woods yet, you know.

60
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,505
I, uh, got to raise         
    a little bit more capital

61
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:14,575
and i have to find myself      
 a few investors.

     no, no, no, guys,          
     guys. Whoa!

63
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,232
Not you. I'm talking about     
 people with real money.

64
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,000
Uh, what's the matter, sam? 
    Our money's not good enough 
    for you?

00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,769
Uh, that's right.

 i was offended,

68

but i got over it.

69
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:34,045
So, sammy,                     
 how much cash do you need?

Yeah. Yeah,                    
 maybe you're right, huh?

77
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh, sammy,                 
     you can do it.

78
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,562
Well, yeah. Right,             
 no, of course i can do it.

00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,816

 you know, this morning,

81
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:58,019
i, uh, i made                  
 a rather clever investment     
 of $1,000.

82
00:03:58,086 --> 00:03:59,304
Way to be, sammy.

83
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,972
That's using    
                the old noggin. 
                Let that money

84
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,039
work for you, pal.

85
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,226
What did you invest in? 
        This suit.

86
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,195
Looks pretty good,             
 doesn't it?                    
                     Yeah.

87
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:10,297
I tell you, this jacket    
     just over levis alone      
     is fabulous.

88
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,818
(Frasier)  
                     well...

89
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,903
the notion of investing 
        is--is sound.

90
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,038
In fact i have $500    
         here in my pocket

91
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:21,476
that lilith has entrusted me   
 to invest in                   
 a gilt-edged bond

92
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,161
for little frederick's 
         future.

93
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,563
So lilith controls             
 the purse strings              
 in your family, huh?

94
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,298
Oh, yes,                       
 with a eagle-eye.

95
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,033
It's a good thing, too.        
 I mean,

96
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,868
you know me, if was left       
 to my own devices,

97
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,872
wastrel that i am,             
 i might blow up $2 a week      
 on a lousy beer.

98
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,458
Hmm, well, investing   
         sounds good            
         on paper, frase,

99
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,194
but problem is,            
     with inflation, you know,

100
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,196
when those bonds mature,    
    that money'll be worthless.

101
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,148
So little freddy will   
        lose money on the deal.

102
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:46,333
Oh, well, screw him.           
 Teach him life is real.

103
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,242
Hey, gang, look.               
 It's gilligan                  
 and the millionaire.

104
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,596
Mr. Colcord, you're not        
 supposed to                    
 walk ahead of security.

105
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,231
It's all right.            
     I know these people.

106
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:01,699
Wait for me outside.

107
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,118
Huh, one security guy,     
     big deal.

108
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:05,486
[All scoffing]

109
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,772
ok, boys,                      
 rendezvous at the limo.

110
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,969
12 security guys,              
 big deal.

111
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,956
So, uh, what's with 
            all the g-men?

112
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:28,192
Oh, it's, uh,                  
 nothing, really.

113
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,211
Well, don't be modest, 
         robin.

114
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,413
People want to kill him.

115
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,003
You're kidding me. Who?

116
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,838
Well, i can't go into detail.  
 Let's just say

117
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:43,274
that i'm involved              
 in delicate                    
 financial dealings

118
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,659
with some sensitive            
 political areas.

119
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,412
Oh, a little, uh,          
     arms trading there, huh?

120
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,666
That's cliff.

121
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,968
People wanna kill him, too.

122
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,621
Who's after you?

123
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,758
Oh, well, who isn't, eh?       
 It's one of the drawbacks      
 of wealth.

124
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:02,326
Oh, well, enough of this   
     assassination folderol.

125
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:05,013
Do you wanna hear          
     something really exciting?

126
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,098
Robin took me              
     to the harbor today        
     to see his new sailboat,

127
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,067
and as coincidence 
             would have it,

128
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,237
it is called  <i>the rebecca.</i>

129
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,191
You named your boat    
         after miss howe?

130
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,610
No, i christened her           
 long before i met miss howe.

131
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,530
In fact i named her            
 for the biblical rebecca.

132
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:23,731
(Rebecca)               
        but that's not all.

133
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,534
I had an aunt who was named 
    after the biblical rebecca,

134
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,586
and i am named     
             after her.

135
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,471
And that isn't 
                 the end of it.

136
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,374
She was big as a boat  
         and old as the bible.

137
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,028
Ah, yes, rebecca,      
         wasn't that the maiden

138
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:41,815
king david, uh,        
         espied taking a bath   
         in her birthday suit?

139
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:43,985
Mmm, no, no, could be--        
 i think that was bathsheba.

140
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:46,620
I think rebecca's the one  
     that turned into           
     a pillar of salt.

141
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,639
No, no, that--             
     that was, uh, lot's wife.

142
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,309
She didn't have a name     
     of her own.

143
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,761
Then what did          
         lot do with her after  
         she turned into salt?

144
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,997
Kept her by the pretzels,  
     i bet, huh?

145
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,786
They had pretzels   
            in biblical times?

146
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,372
Yeah. I think          
         i just had one, too.

147
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:10,912
So, where is               
     the boat now?

148
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,064
Oh, we just, uh,               
 got  <i>rebecca</i> out of dry docks.

149
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,466
Scraping the barnacles         
 off her bottom.

150
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,067
Not one word.

151
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:23,791
You know, this is a bar.   
     I'm free to say            
     whatever i want.

152
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,560
I'll give you $5.

153
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,728
Mum's the word.

154
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,547
Yes, i'm, uh,                  
 preparing to sail her

155
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,432
in the cape cod regatta        
 this afternoon.

156
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,084
Oh, fast boat, huh?

157
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,886
Yes. You won't find one        
 faster than  <i>rebecca.</i>

158
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,970
Ahem.

159
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:46,830
Sir, this just came over   
     the fax in the limousine.

160
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:50,501
Damn it, my bauxite miners     
 are threatening me with        
 a wildcat strike at midnight

161
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,737
unless i negotiate     
         with them personally.

162
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,672
Bauxite, huh?

163
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,491
That's the stuff           
     they make missile casings  
     out of, isn't it?

164
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,426
Don't cut this guy off 
         in traffic.

165
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,412
Uh, fax them       
             i'm on my way

166
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,097
and fill a briefcase   
         full of cash.

167
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:04,615
(Man)                  
         yes, sir.

168
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,116
Drat, there goes the race.

169
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,085
I mean, i spent all that time  
 cleaning  <i>rebecca</i> up,

170
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,271
and now  i can't get her   
     out of her slip.

171
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,873
That's worth $10               
 if it's worth a nickel.

172
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:17,178
You know, it's, uh, too bad    
 you can't enter that race.

173
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,999
Right here in the paper        
 the first prize                
 is, uh, $10,000.

174
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,034
It's up to $10,000?        
 Yeah.

175
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,237
Uh, gentleman, in the time  
    it takes me to say $10,000, 
    i make $10,000.

176
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,106
Oh, there i go again.

177
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,843
Look.

178
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,895
$10,000.

179
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:38,165
Yes, it also works 
             if you say it.

180
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,451
Well, i'd better make  
         some calls             
         and rattle some cages

181
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,852
before i go off 
                to the mines.

182
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,839
Uh, rebecca, is the phone  
     in your office tapped?

183
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,223
No.

184
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,009
Nothing she has                
 has been tapped for 3 years.

185
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,716
Hey, sammy,            
         why don't you sail     
         robin's boat?

186
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,251
You could really       
         use the money.

187
00:08:57,253 --> 00:09:00,121
Yeah, i'm sure                 
 he's gonna give                
 his fancy boat

188
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,473
named after my fat aunt        
 to you.

189
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,026
Well, you can ask him.

190
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,412
Yeah.      
     Yeah.

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,563
Yeah.                  
             I would.

192
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,365
Of course, you know,       
     he'll probably laugh at me

193
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,667
and say, "why should   
         i give you my boat?"

194
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:14,986
But then i could say,

195
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,088
"well, you know, it's a--   
    it's a business deal,

196
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:21,225
and if i win,              
     then you'll have this, uh, 
     this beautiful trophy."

197
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,460
Yeah.

198
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:25,296
Of course           
            then he'll probably 
            look at me and say,

199
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:28,332
"why should i give a yutz      
 like you my fancy boat?"

200
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,450
Well...

201
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:30,968
then i'd say,              
     "hey, listen to me.

202
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,870
"I, you know, i happen to be   
 a very good sailor.

203
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,673
"As a matter of fact,   
        in '83 i came close     
        to winning that race.

204
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,042
And where did you           
    get off calling me a yutz?" 
    You know?

205
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,944
"You don't even know me."

206
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,513
And he'd probably say,     
     "i may not know you,       
     but i know your kind."

207
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,748
You know, and that would       
 really tick me off.            
 So i'd say,

208
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,034
"hey, i'll tell you        
     somethin'.

209
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,152
Well, how about you            
 just step outside with me?"

210
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:50,955
Uh, i was thinking, 
            sam, uh,

211
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,724
rebecca tells me   
             you're a sailor.

212
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,975
Why don't you   
                race my boat?

213
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,828
Oh, sure. Yeah, great.

214
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,681
Hey, i happen to be        
     a very good sailor.

215
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:01,799
Yes. Fine.

216
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,617
And i'm not a yutz.

217
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,821
Good for you, sam.

218
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,342
I'll call you later.

219
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,912
Oh, sam, you can               
 pick the keys up at pier 17,   
 in the yacht club.

220
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,799
And you'll need a crew.    
     <i>Rebecca</i> takes 3 men.

221
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,054
No, no, no, 
                    no, no, no.

222
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,923
Buy 4, get one free.

223
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:31,429
Hey, guys, huh,                
 how about this?

224
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,531
I'm going to be                
 in the regatta this afternoon.

225
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,966
Well, you just better not      
 do anything to that boat

226
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,568
because robin has          
     promised me

227
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:39,636
that the two of us         
     are gonna take a cruise    
     on  <i>the rebecca</i>

228
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,405
to the virgin islands.

229
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:44,809
Wow, a boat and an island  
     named after you            
     in the same day.

230
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:51,165
All right.                     
 All right, i got to get me     
 a crew here, don't i?

231
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,367
Um, well, say there, carla...  
                     yes.

232
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,570
...you're, uh, used to         
 being around sailors,          
 aren't you?

233
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,321
Mmm-hmm.

234
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,873
I'm with you, sammy.   
         Anything to get        
         this bar back.

235
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,176
All right, that's one.         
 Uh, one more to go here.

236
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,312
Ahem.              
    (Sam)                       
    uh...

237
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,631
come on, man,                  
 you were in the coast guard,   
 weren't you?

238
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:07,965
Right, sam.

239
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,134
I'd go with you in a second 
    if it weren't               
    for those horses.

240
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,702
What horses?               
            Wild ones.

241
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:15,222
They don't make 'em        
     strong enough to drag me   
     on board a boat now.

242
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,725
We'll be bringin'              
 a cooler of beer.

243
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:20,010
[Grunting]         
             come on!

244
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:23,230
All right!                  
    Hey, i got my crew here.

245
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,432
All right, you guys,       
     i'm going to make a call   
     over to, uh,

246
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,301
gary's old town tavern

247
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,737
to see if i can get, uh,   
     a little betting goin' on

248
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,222
with those pigeons 
             down there.

249
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,423
Ok, so, uh,

250
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,926
what do you say, uh... 
         $100 says we lose?

251
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,227
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

252
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,411
Come on.

253
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:41,215
All right, i'm sorry.      
     All right, $5 says we win.

254
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,685
Hello, gar?            
         Yeah, cliff clavin     
         over here at cheers.

255
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:47,087
Hey, it's mr. Weenie   
         to you, pal.

256
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,624
Let's huddle up here, carla.   
                    All right.

257
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,393
Listen, uh, we got             
 to remember something          
 here now.

258
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:56,297
We can no longer           
     think of ourselves         
     as 3 individuals.

259
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:59,966
We are 3 parts             
     of the same machine        
     working together.

260
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:03,470
3 people with              
     one single purpose.

261
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,006
Not to drown.

262
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:09,544
All right. All right.       
    2 single purposes.

263
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,546
Not to drown               
     and win the race.

264
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,847
Ok, what about,            
     you know, getting all wet  
     and getting sick?

265
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,683
All right.                 
     3 single purposes.

266
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,185
How about              
         buying the bar back?

267
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:20,270
All right, 4-- does anyone     
 have a piece of paper here?

268
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,656
All right, guys. I, uh,    
     struck a deal with gary.

269
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,258
He says that                
    he'll give us 5 to one odds

270
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,894
if we can come up with, 
        uh, $500 cash           
        before the race.

271
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,862
Where the hell                 
 are we gonna get $500 cash?

272
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,097
Yeah.

273
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:31,515
Yeah.

274
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,051
Hey, hey, hey.

275
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,453
Who in the world

276
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,655
carries $500           
         in their pocket?

277
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,493
Yeah. Got any ideas 
            there, frase?

278
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,728
Let's see.

279
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,414
Um...

280
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:50,083
i find myself                  
 in the horns of a dilemma.

281
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,353
Do i keep the money?           
 In which case,                 
 you guys would pants me

282
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,655
and hang me                    
 from the nearest flagpole.     
 Or, uh,

283
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,323
do i give you the money?       
 In which case

284
00:12:56,391 --> 00:13:01,228
my darling wife             
    will see to it that         
    i don't need pants again.

285
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:04,598
No, it seems to me          
    there's only                
    one decent thing to do.

286
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,217
Run like a jackrabbit!

287
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,356
Oh, no, lilith,        
         no, you're mistaken.

288
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,425
You did not give me $500.

289
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:18,729
I mean, honey, how would    
    i forget a thing like that?

290
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,832
Well, did you-- did you look   
 under all the sofa cushions?

291
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,835
And how about, uh,      
        behind your dresser?

292
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:27,238
Yes, well, well,       
         keep on looking.

293
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,208
Maybe it's in your web.

294
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:40,017
Hey, guys, all sports is    
    showing sammy's boat race.

295
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:43,036

Come on, sammy!

300
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,812
Baby needs                 
     a bachelor of arts degree!

301
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,781
Ah, don't worry there, frase.  
 You know, sammy's              
 an experienced sailor.

302
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:57,017
Oh, yeah, yeah. You know once  
 he whips carla and norm

303
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,286
into an experienced     
        and efficient crew,

304
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:01,605
he's gonna have that baby sail 
 like a swiss watch.

305
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,824
So, you're telling me  
         i should               
         kiss my $500 goodbye.

306
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:05,409
Pucker up, baby.

307
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,400
All right, guys, stand by!

308
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,136
Stand by on the mainsail!

309
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,372
Stand by to come about!

310
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:21,375
Hey, come on, guys.        
     What are you doin'?

311
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,578
Standing by the cooler.        
 Can i get you anything, sam?

312
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:27,965
Hey, come on. This is          
 your chance to win back        
 sammy's bar here.

313
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,618
Come on, sam.              
     We've lost the race,       
     gotten sick,

314
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:31,985
made fools of ourselves.

315
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,521
I say it's miller time, pal.

316
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,739
(Carla)             
            yeah.

317
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,258
Hey, what is that,             
 quitter's talk?

318
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,377
If it's not,                   
 we'll think of some more.

319
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:41,879
Yeah. Well, i'm not givin' up.

320
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,263
How about               
        another beer, norm?

321
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,165
Yeah, comin' up.

322
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:49,653
Uh-oh. That's it       
         for the cheap stuff.

323
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,755
Let's see if colcord           
 keeps anything in his fridge.

324
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,206
Oh, yeah. Break it out.

325
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,342
[Clearing throat]

326
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,879
bingo. All right.

327
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:02,015
Why would colcord      
         keep a digital clock   
         in his refrigerator?

328
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,684
That's weird.  
         Yeah.

329
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:06,019
It has like, uh,           
     all these wires            
     comin' out of it.

330
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:07,287
It's goin' backwards, too.

331
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,889
Does it have                   
 a snooze button?

332
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:12,009
No, no,                
         it just has this thing 
         marked "detonator."

333
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,796
(Both)             
             uh-oh.

334
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:18,098
Sam!

335
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,866
Sam!

336
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:30,828
What? I can't                  
 keep comin' down here          
 every 2 seconds.

337
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,462
Come on, guys,                 
 you should be up there.

338
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,865
We're all gonna be         
     up there in a second, sam.

339
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,834
Over here,              
        over there, everywhere.

340
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,602
We're gonna be chum, pal.

341
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,837
What are you talkin' about?

342
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,755
There's a bomb                 
 in the fridge.

343
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:43,907
What?

344
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:46,610
Oh, no!

345
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,045
[Exclaiming]

346
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,281
[beeping]

347
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,582
oh, boy.

348
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,318
Well, maybe it's, uh,

349
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,487
one of those, uh,           
    devices

350
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:00,557
to keep you from raiding       
 the refrigerator, huh?

351
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:02,626
No. Trust me, sammy.   
         I've seen them all.

352
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,167
All right, looks like       
    we got about                
    28 minutes there.

353
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,568
Let's not panic.

354
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,886
Let go of me.              
     Don't--don't touch me.

355
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:16,474
All right, ok, uh,      
        all right,              
        we'll just, uh...

356
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,943
well, we'll call           
     the coast guard            
     is what we'll do here.

357
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,344
They'll know what to do.

358
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,596
All right,             
         just don't panic here. 
         Don't panic.

359
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,047
Panic is our worst enemy.

360
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,233
Yeah, well, this bomb  
         is a close 2nd, sammy.

361
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,252
Mayday, mayday.

362
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,522
Damn. This thing doesn't seem  
 to be working here.

363
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,723
Oh, god.                   
             Mayday--

364
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,778
yeah, well,            
         there's your problem   
         there, sammy.

365
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,299
Well, what do                  
 we do now, skipper?

366
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,201
I think we ought to rely   
     on an old, uh, skill

367
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:46,003
that i learned      
            in the coast guard.

368
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,037
Uh, radios, munitions...

369
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:49,206
no, no. Abandon ship!  
         Abandon ship!

370
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,242
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

371
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,542
All right,                     
 careful, careful.

372
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,643
[All clamoring]

373
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:56,814
all right,                     
 i got it. All right.

374
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,982
(Sam)                          
 all right, what are those      
 fins out there?

375
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,551
(Carla)             
            sharks!

376
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,553
(Norm)             
             abandon water!     
             Abandon water!

377
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,755
Oh!

378
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,891
Oh god. Oh, hold it.   
         Wait a minute,         
         wait a minute.

379
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,793
What?          
     How about this?

380
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:12,930
If one of us                
    is willing to go            
    overboard...

381
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,866
uh-huh.                        
 ...and create a diversion      
 for the sharks,

382
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,536
then maybe sammy and i         
 could swim to safety.

383
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,241
I never liked you, carla.

384
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,826
All right, wait, wait. 
         Come on, now. Come on.

385
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:27,595
Sammy, wait a minute.

386
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,112
What about your dinghy?

387
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,348
Oh, yeah.                  
     That's what i'm gonna miss 
     most of all.

388
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,267
Idiot!

389
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,837
I mean the little boat         
 we can get away in.

390
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:39,339
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.      
     What am i thinking here?

391
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:40,474
All right, ok,      
            here we go.

392
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,642
There it is.

393
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,711
All right.                 
     Well, how does it work?

394
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:46,213
Yeah, you take up on deck      
 and you pull this cord here.

395
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,481
[Hissing]              
                 no, not yet!

396
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:48,949
[Exclaiming]

397
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,024
"pull cord.                
     You're gonna die."

398
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,842
Oh, we're gonna die.

399
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:00,744
We're gonna die.            
    We're gonna die.

400
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,212
No. We're gonna die.

401
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,531
Ok, come on, just listen,  
     listen, you guys, listen.

402
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,766
We've still got time here.

403
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,934
Now, if you help me,

404
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:10,721
maybe we can, uh...            
 we--we sail this thing         
 to shore before it blows up.

405
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,305
Do you really think 
            we could do that?

406
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:13,707
Yeah, yeah,        
             you bet i do.

407
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,326
If we don't,                   
 we'll die trying.              
 Come on.

408
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,128
Come on, man.           
        Let's go for it, sammy!

409
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,762
(Sam)                          
 here, get this rope.           
         I got it.

410
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,631
[Carla chattering]

411
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:23,300
if i go,               
         i'm not goin' alone.

412
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:25,236
[Beeping]

413
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,329
were you scared, sam?       
            Are you kidding?

414
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:38,965
I saw my hair          
         pass before my eyes.

415
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,101
It's unbelievable.         
     I've never seen anything   
     like it.

416
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,053
Really. I mean, 
                we--we just     
                barely made it

417
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,988
to this little inlet. Right?

418
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,324
We jumped off the boat 
         onto the beach,

419
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,226
we ran about 50 yards,

420
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,761
and this baby exploded 
         like a roman candle.

421
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,964
I'm telling you         
        there were bits of boat 
        everywhere.

422
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,966
Unbelievable.               
     That is truly horrifying.

423
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,634
Yeah, how about this, huh?

424
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,203
Was that where              
    a piece of the boat         
    hit you?

425
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,355
No, i ripped my thumb          
 on one of                      
 colcord's beers.

426
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:05,008
Those imports                  
 don't have twistoffs.          
 It still smarts.

427
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:09,562
You know, uh, something        
 very similar happened to me    
 about 10 years ago.

428
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,716
You see, my ma was makin'      
 this homemade bread            
 in a crock pot--

429
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,335
wait a minute, cliff.          
 Unless that crock pot          
 exploded in your face,

430
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,405
i don't want                   
 to hear about it, ok?          
 There's no comparison.

431
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:20,290
Well, suffice it to say,

432
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,077
that was the week i started    
 growin' this moustache.

433
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,530
Well, it's closin' time,    
    guys.

434
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:27,865
Yep, i'm out of here.

435
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:30,667
I think me and my crew  
        are gonna hang out here 
        for a little while.

436
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:34,204
Listen, frase, man,        
     i-i'm sorry about losing   
     your $500 like that.

437
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,140
I hope lilith doesn't      
     give you too tough a time.

438
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,075
Oh, you know, i--

439
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,712
i paint a pretty ugly          
 picture of lilith              
 once in a while,

440
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:43,881
but deep down,                 
 she's really                   
 a pretty good-hearted

441
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,448
and forgiving person.

442
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,801
Wow. Give her my best  
         when you get home.

443
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,202
Home? Are you nuts?

444
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,905
I'm staying at the sheraton    
 for a couple of weeks.

445
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,482
Well, guys,                
     that's another half-hour

446
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,117
that we wouldn't have had  
     if we hadn't               
     gotten off that boat.

447
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,069
Yeah.                          
             Phew.

448
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,438
I tell you a brush     
         with death like that   
         really changes you.

449
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:09,873
Mmm.

450
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,126
From now on, i'm really    
     going to appreciate beer.

451
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:15,062
I'll go get my coat.

452
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,479
I'll tell you          
         what gets me.

453
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,315
We almost get killed           
 for this jerk                  
 robin colcord,

454
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,018
and he doesn't even--          
 he didn't call us,             
 didn't send us flowers...

455
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,086
no.        
 ...didn't fax.

456
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:24,220
Not a word, no.

457
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:25,522
I tell you something,          
 it's the last time

458
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,090
i'm gonna                      
 almost blow up                 
 for that guy.

459
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:28,458
[Sighs]

460
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,760
i better call vera, 
            i suppose.

461
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:31,127
Yeah, i bet                    
 she's worried sick.

462
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,429
Yeah.

463
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,163
I tell you, if i act   
         upset enough,

464
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,500
i might be able to     
         parlay this            
         into a poker weekend.

465
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,605
Ah, there you are, sam.        
         Yeah.

466
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,507
Here i am.

467
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,774
I got back                 
     from the union meeting

468
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:47,010
and just now heard     
         about the explosion.

469
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,679
Well, we're all ok.

470
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:49,880
Yes, i can see that.

471
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,349
Now, would you sign         
    these, uh, release forms?   
    It's, uh,

472
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,685
just a technicality            
 from my insurance department

473
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,903
but it will protect you 
        from further hassles.

474
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,273
Release forms?

475
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,192
I mean, that's all     
         you care about,        
         is saving your butt.

476
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,194
You know,                  
     we went through hell       
     out there.

477
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,262
Yes, i'm sorry.            
     I don't know               
     what i was thinking of.

478
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,682
Um, believe me,                
 if i'd known there was a bomb  
 onboard the boat,

479
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,083
i would never have     
         let you near it.

480
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:12,870
I just admire                  
 your courage, and, uh...

481
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,588
will you let me do      
        something for you?

482
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:18,008
Now, sam, how much     
         do you suppose         
         your life is worth?

483
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,077
Should we say $50,000?         
 Does that sound fair?

484
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,313
What are you   
                 talkin' about? 
 No, no, i've insulted you.

485
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:26,884
$60,000. $50,000 in cash,      
 and $10,000 in stock options.

486
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,387
Stop. Hey, stop that.

487
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,955
This--this is not  
             about money.

488
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:35,225
This is about human life.  
     Mine and my friends'.

489
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,094
You know, you may not  
         understand this,

490
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,762
but there are some things  
     you can't buy.

491
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,848
There are some things      
     more precious than money.

492
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:44,934
Human life and a little 
        simple human dignity.

493
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,187
Yes, obviously                 
 you're still hysterical, sam.

494
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,705
No, i'm not.

495
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,241
I'll tell you somethin'.   
     Why don't you              
     just take your checkbook

496
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,742
and drop it down        
        your bauxite mine.

497
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,644
You know, my life is worth 
     more than money.

498
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:56,212
Uh, sam, if you're trying   
    to haggle--

499
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,914
no, i'm not.                   
 I don't want your money, ok?

500
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,949
I just want                    
 a little simple apology

501
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,818
and a little concern           
 for all of us.

502
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,336
Yeah.   
                 Yeah.

503
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,988
Ok, um, i'm sorry.

504
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,242
How are you all?

505
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,510
Ok.         
         Not too bad, you know.

506
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,395
Yes, well, i'm off.

507
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,753
Can you believe that?          
 Rich people.

508
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,187
We almost died for him

509
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:22,723
and he thinks                  
 he can spread                  
 a little money around

510
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,690
and make it all right.

511
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,241
Yeah.                          
 Rich people are sick.

512
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:27,077
I'm glad he didn't mention 
     that when i was there.

513
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,895
I would have taken  
            a poke at him.      
         Yeah.

514
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,414
I said it for all of us.       
 I told him what to do          
 with his check.

515
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:33,483
Yeah, we're with you, sam.  
 Can you believe that?

516
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:38,221
Thinking he can come in here   
 and buy the 3 of us            
 for a measly $60,000.

517
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:43,143
Abandon sammy!         
                     Robin!

518
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,410
Yo, yo, robin.         
                    Hey, robin!

519
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:46,847
(Both)                 
         abandon sammy!         
         Abandon sammy!
