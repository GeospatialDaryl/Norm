Cheers <i>is filmed before</i>    
     <i>a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Man, how about all that stuff  
that's going on over at Cheers?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
What's that?

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,500
You don't know about that?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,300
Well, Rebecca, the babe         
who runs the place,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,700
you know she's been             
dating Robin Colcord,           
the multimillionaire.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,700
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Well, he tried to pull          
a hostile takeover

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,000
of her corporation and she      
was implicated in the deal.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,600
So the corporation dumped her.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,100
Guess who ended up              
owning Cheers.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,600
Sam Malone.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,900
You're kidding.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Wait, you haven't heard     
         the best part.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Now, Colcord          
      skipped the country,

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,500
so Rebecca's ended up      
having to take a waitress job...

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,300
at Cheers.              
                            Wow.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,000
W-Where do you get              
this stuff, anyway?

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,900
I got my sources.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,400
Another round on the house,   
         Mr. Peterson?

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,700
Thank you very much.

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,900

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,000
Is Rebecca in her office?

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,900
I thought you ditched her

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
and skipped the country.

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,800
I did, but I've come back.

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
I finally realized what     
      Rebecca means to me.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
What use is my money      
         or my freedom

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,200
if I don't have the woman       
            I love?

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Rebecca?!

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,300
(gasps)             
I'm back.

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!     
          Oh, my God!

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,100
Oh, my God!

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,700
Rebecca, what is going     
          on in here?

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Robin, I can explain.

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,900
My button's caught
            in your zipper here.

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Robin, I can't explain.

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,900
It's my own fault.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,700
For all you knew, I was     
    never coming back again.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,200
I left the way clear for    
 something like this to happen.

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,500
But Robin, nothing did happen.

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,300
Nothing?                    
                No, nothing.

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay, something almost happened
but I would never betray you.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I love you.

61
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,200
We didn't do anything.

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,900
Did we, Sam?

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,800
Yeah...

64
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,100
(clearing throat):          
    ...what she said.

65
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,300
(knocking)

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey, jailbird,         
  your lawyer's on the phone.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your lawyer?!

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes, I've made arrangements     
to turn myself in.

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh, Robin.

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,100
Oh, I'll wait for you.

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
I won't have any money          
when I come out.

72
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,300
That doesn't matter.

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,300
I'll help you rebuild   
                your fortune.

74
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah, just look at what        
 she's done with this bar.

75
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,700
Oh, shut up.

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,300
Boy, just because you           
lose a few billion bucks

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,600
is no reason                    
to cop a 'tude.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,600
I guess I should go see     
    if Robin needs any help.

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Sure.

80
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,700
Sam?

81
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you for lying about...

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,900
you know.

83
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,100
It's okay, sure.

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Thank you for... you know.

85
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,600
I just think it was the
              right thing to do.

86
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
The lying, I mean,
            not the, you know...

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Well, that, too.

88
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah.

89
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,100
Anyway... (clears throat)   
                 well... see ya.

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
See ya.

91
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
(tiny object clattering)

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
Oh...

93
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
Your button.

94
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,900
Yeah. Thank you.

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,200
Well, my attorney's       
    spoken to the prosecutor

96
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,700
and I... I have to go.

97
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,500
Can't we at least wait     
         till morning?

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Well, my attorney says that   
    if I turn myself in now,

99
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,300
I can avoid a media circus.

100
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,100
Do you have any idea what       
these sleazy tabloids would pay

101
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,500
for a picture of Robin Colcord  
the fugitive?

102
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,600
(gasps)

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,100
Okay, let's try               
  another one,

104
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,700
only, this time, look           
a little bit more guilty.

105
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
Guilty?!

106
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,800
SAM:
                What do you guys
                     think, huh?

107
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm finished.

108
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,200
With, uh, with what, Sam?

109
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,400
With putting my old stuff       
    back on the wall.

110
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
It was gone?

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,600
Yeah, it was gone--

112
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,400
three years gone, man.

113
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,200
Rebecca had her stuff up there.

114
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Ah.                         
                Are you so taken
             with your own lives

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,600
you don't notice the      
 changes going on around here?

116
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,800
Sammy, we notice the important
              things, all right?

117
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,700
By the way, is Diane
                coming in today?

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,900
Hey!                    
                            Hey!

119
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,800
Give this man      
            a drink-- whoo!

120
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,300
Sammy, I just realized,

121
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,000
I forgot to call Ma and
         tell her the good news.

122
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,300
You know how          
         she loves you.

123
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Boy, she's gonna be       
          tickled pink

124
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,700
when she hears you got     
         the bar back.

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Hello, Ma!

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Guess who the new   
             owner of Cheers is.

127
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,300
No, it's not me,
             it's, uh, it's Sam.

128
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,500
Well, I'm, uh, still
                  a mailman, Ma.

129
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,200
Well, I know you had
          high hopes for me, Ma,

130
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,700
but I couldn't finish college   
  and that's all there is to it.

131
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
She was thrilled.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,900
SAM:                            
Hey, Woody.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,900
It says here that               
you and Carla

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
haven't had a raise             
for over two years.

135
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
That's right, Sam.

136
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,500
I guess that's why I been   
        so darn moody lately.

137
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
Well, that's one of the things  
that's gonna change around here.

138
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Starting tomorrow, you guys     
get a $20-a-week raise.

139
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600
Wow, thanks.

140
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,700
Another thing here,       
        while I'm at it,

141
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,300
to celebrate the new management,

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,600
I am wiping out         
      everybody's bar tab.

143
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,500
Sam Malone, I am not a man      
      for mushy sentiment,

144
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
but I want you         
      to know something--

145
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
if you ever need a liver donor, 
I've got one like yea big.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,000
Woody, round of drinks on       
    the house for everybody.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,300
All right!

148
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
(cheering)

149
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Hi, Sam.

150
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Oh, hi.

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,500
I didn't expect to see
      you waitressing here today

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
with your billionaire   
         boyfriend back in town.

153
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Well, it's only temporary       
until I find a good job.

154
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,900
You know what they say--

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,600
better a temporary dead-end     
stupid job than no job at all.

156
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Ah, just what every       
    employer wants to hear.

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,300
Excuse me.

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm gonna, uh, take       
     these plants of yours

159
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
out to the woods        
  and give them their freedom.

160
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,600
So, what's new, Miss Howe?

161
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,000
I just got back from            
visiting Robin in jail.

162
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,900
They're not going               
to let him out on bail

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
since he jumped                 
bond earlier.

164
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,200
They're gonna charge him        
a huge penalty, even if         
he pleads guilty.

165
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,400
I don't think they're gonna give
that poor guy any breaks at all.

166
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,700
I got a raise.

167
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,100
You deserve it, Woody.

168
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,500
I deserved it two years ago.

169
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,100
Who was the boss then?

170
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,100
Let me think.

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,800
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

172
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,400
Boy, of all days for my kids to 
handcuff me to the water heater.

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,100
Why, uh, what's the big deal  
          about today?

174
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,100
Didn't Sam tell         
    you what happened

175
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,300
in the office last night?

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
No. What?

177
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,000
He and Rebecca were in there  
for for a mighty long time

178
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,700
and that place was wrecked.

179
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,900
He didn't mention a thing.      
Really?

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,700
Maybe he's saving all      
the dirty details for me.

181
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,900
He's such a gentleman.

182
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,000
(watch alarm beeps          
          three times)

183
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,900
Well, fellows, that's the bell

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,400
announcing Clavin's midmorning 
         brain twister.

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Oh, you going to get up         
and try to walk again?

186
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,600
Is this going to be along       
         the same lines

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,700
as yesterday's little pearl?

188
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
If the Lennon Sisters,     
      the Maguire Sisters

189
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,800
and the Andrew Sisters          
all came to a four-way stop,

190
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,500
which would have                
the right-of-way?

191
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,400
No, no, no, no.

192
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,000
This one is, uh, based on       
        historical fact.

193
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Now listen up.

194
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,300
How would the Civil War     
          have changed

195
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,800
if Lincoln had had octopus      
 tentacles instead of a beard?

196
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,500
For God's sake, Cliff.

197
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
There is no practical           
answer to that question.

198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,900
Wait, wait,
            wait, wait, wait.

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,300
Now we can assume that
          the Gettysburg Address

200
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,600
would have been written on
    the back of eight envelopes.

201
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,700
Very good.

202
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,900
Very good answer, Normie.

203
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Also, he could have disarmed    
John Wilkes Booth

204
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,100
and still applauded the play.

205
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Now, in a related query,

206
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,300
what if Herbert Hoover was      
    able to expand his face

207
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,500
like a blowfish?

208
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,100
What were you guys              
talking about?

209
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Former presidents with     
fish parts in their faces.

210
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Come on.

211
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,300
Do you really expect
            me to believe

212
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
you were talking about 
         something that stupid?

213
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,600
Where have you been             
all these years?

214
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,000
Hello!

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,300
I know what you     
                 were doing.

216
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
You were trying to  
          cover up the fact that

217
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,900
you were gossiping      
                about me.

218
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,000
REBECCA:                        
And, as soon as                 
I turn my back,

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,400
you will go on about Sam and
    I in that office last night.

220
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,600
Didn't I tell you?              
I knew something happened.

221
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,000
Ooh, guys, do you think Sammy  
    finally bagged Rebecca?

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,700
MEN:              
             Yeah!

223
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh, hey, Rebecca,   
                      I'm sorry.

224
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
This is, you know,
        just guy talk, you know.

225
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,600
Carla, you think he
         finally bagged Rebecca?

226
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah!

227
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,400
There he is.

228
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,500
Why don't we ask him?

229
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,900
Sammy,

230
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,500
last night--

231
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,800
you-- the Howitzer          
         in the office.

232
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,500
Come on.
                        NORM:   
                Come on, Sam.

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,900
Come on.

234
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,100
Guys, guys, that's tacky.

235
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Sam, we know that.

236
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,600
It says it above
              the door. Come on.

237
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,900
All right, if you must know--

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,200
nothing happened.

239
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,300
End of story.

240
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,000
I guess nothing did happen.

241
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,400
I guess not.

242
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,300
Sammy would never withhold
          information like that.

243
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,500
No. He lives to talk            
about that stuff.

244
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,300
And we live to
                  hear about it.

245
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,900
Aw, it's a symbiotic      
         relationship.          
                         Mm-hmm.

246
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,000
Much like that between the shark
    and the tiny pilot fish

247
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,700
that constantly swims      
        around its mouth

248
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,600
picking out the little     
         bits of meat.

249
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,700
I suppose you're now            
going to tell me

250
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,300
that if George Washington       
had had a pilot fish,

251
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
he wouldn't have                
needed wooden dentures.

252
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,700
Now you're getting              
up to speed, Dr. Crane.

253
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,400
And then he could have, uh,   
    swum across the Delaware

255
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
to defeat the Hessians.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
(laughing):                     
No Dr. Crane,

257
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
try to understand.

258
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,000
It's only the president's       
    face that changes.

259
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,200
It's not like he grew fins      
         or something.

260
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,900
(silly gibbering)

261
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
(knocking on door)

262
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
Sam.

263
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh, hi.

264
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,800
I wanted to thank you      
      for your discretion.

265
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,100
What do you mean?

266
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Well, not telling Robin     
    about us was one thing,

267
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,300
but not telling all       
    those goons out there--

268
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,000
I know that was         
    a real sacrifice.

269
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,500
No, no big deal.    
Yes, it is.

270
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,300
I know how much you love

271
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,700
to crow to all         
          your friends

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,900
about your great        
      romantic encounters.

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,500
Rebecca, believe me,
                 it was nothing.

274
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,500
Wait, wait-- not telling
            them was nothing,

275
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,900
or the great romantic   
          encounter was nothing?

276
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,400
What?

277
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,200
Oh, uh, the not                 
telling, of course.

278
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
No, the... romantic             
stuff was great.

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,100
Wasn't it?

280
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,500
You know, I don't mean to be
  disloyal to Robin or anything,

281
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,000
but... it was one of
        the most powerful things

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,700
that's ever happened
            to me in my life.

283
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,900
Really?

284
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
You need to get out more, hon.

285
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,500
What?

286
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,800
You mean you didn't like it?

287
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,600
No, I said I did,   
                didn't I?

288
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,700
No, it was great.

289
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
I liked... I really,
          really liked it a lot.

290
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,400
But what?

291
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
Uh... I don't know.

292
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,800
It's, like,

293
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,200
maybe I was looking forward
    to it too much, you know?

294
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Like when you're really
      excited about a new movie.

295
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,000
Like <i>The Bad News Bears.</i>
                  Remember that?

296
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,400
For weeks, people kept
        coming up and telling me

297
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,300
what a great movie it was.

298
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,900
But when I finally
            went to see it...   
So it wasn't that great.

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,300
No, it's just Tatum O'Neal
         throwing a ball around.

300
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Not that.

301
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Oh, you mean us?

302
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
I told you really,          
      it was fine, honey.

303
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
Fine?!

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
But it was a letdown,      
    like <i>The Bad News Bears.</i>

305
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
No, it was... (sputters)

306
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,600
much better           
    than <i>The Bad News Bears.</i>

307
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,300
Maybe I was a little off.

308
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,500
I don't... you know?

309
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
I mean, I knew         
    that I'd been depressed

310
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,500
and I'd been crying       
  for a couple of days and...

311
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,600
Wait a minute.

312
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
What?

313
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,300
I know what you're doing.

314
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,000
You are trying                  
to convince me

315
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,000
that I was not good in bed,

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,900
so I will go to bed       
         with you again

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,700
to prove how good I can be.

318
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,100
I swear to you, Rebecca...

319
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
No, wait a minute.

320
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,200
We did it once and that's       
     all we're gonna do it.

321
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,100
And no matter how much          
we might want it

322
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
and no matter how great     
     it was for both of us,

323
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,100
we're never doing it again.

324
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,900
Fine.              
    I mean it, never again.

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,200
Gotcha.             
You should listen to me--       
    there is no more.

326
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,500
I hear you

327
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,800
and I agree with you.

328
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
It was a terrific moment that   
         you and I had together,

329
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,900
but the truth is,   
                    you know,

330
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,500
I can see that you love Robin   
            and Robin loves you,

331
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,400
so, truthfully,
                  I'm liberated.

332
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,900
I feel, I feel good.

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,100
But I just hope we can,
    you know, remain friends.

334
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
Get your mind out of your pants.

335
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,300
Hey, wait-wait-wait!
                 Come back here.

336
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,700
I wasn't trying to
              do anything there.

337
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,700
Oh, stop caressing me.

338
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,500
I have had it

339
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,700
with this constant              
sexual harassment!

340
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,300
I am quitting this job

341
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,900
and I'm never                   
coming back here.

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,700
Me too, man.

343
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,100
20 lousy bucks after two years.

344
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,400
Man, I'm out of here.           
Wait up, Miss Howe, wait up...

345
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,100
Woody, that was a personal thing
         between me and Rebecca.

346
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,800
It had nothing to   
             do with your raise.

347
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,700
Well, still, 20 lousy bucks...

348
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Well, that's fine--

349
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,400
25. Now, let's get
                back to work.

350
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,100
Come on.

351
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Hey, keep your hands off.

352
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Wait, wait, wait
          a minute, Sammy, look,

353
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,800
Rebecca just said   
        she was leaving here,   
          and never coming back.

354
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,500
Yeah, that's right.

355
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, man.

356
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,600
This is terrible.

357
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,400
What?

358
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,700
Sammy finally struck
                out for real.

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,900
Ooh.

360
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,200
(customers muttering,      
        murmuring)

361
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,000
What are you talking about here?

362
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,300
We all knew that it       
    was taking a long time,

363
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,100
but we thought that,      
          eventually,

364
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,100
you two would be doing     
the horizontal hokeypokey.

365
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
But I guess that's it, huh?

366
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,500
Lower the flag.

367
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,500
The end of an era.

368
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,200
First, the Communist      
         bloc crumbles,

369
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,700
and now Sammy's studhood.

370
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,100
Yep. Guess that's it.

371
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,300
SAM:              
         No, it's not.

372
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,800
Come here.

373
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
Come on,
                     all of you.

374
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,800
I want you to step in   
            the office there,

375
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,300
and I'll show you where we...

376
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,500
uh, where we, uh,

377
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,000
decided to put up           
 some, uh, some shelves, uh...

378
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,600
Tall ones, you know,      
    it'll be great for books

379
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
and uh, some of my videotapes  
    and everything...

380
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
It'll be nice.

381
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

382
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,700
What I can't figure             
out is why,

383
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,100
why I don't want to tell        
any of my friends.

384
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,900
No, that's not true--      
  I-I do want to, but I can't.

385
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,300
Why? That's...

386
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
That's...                       
You know, maybe

387
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,700
it was such a letdown

388
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,700
that I didn't feel like     
    bragging about it.

389
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,100
Or maybe it was not a letdown

390
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
and I was just ticked      
    that she dumped me

391
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,400
as soon as her boyfriend    
        walked in.

392
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,800
Or maybe she's right

393
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
and I'm just trying to get      
     her in the sack again.

394
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,300
I don't know.

395
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,900
God! I-I just...        
    I-I'm just a simple guy

396
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,600
trying to deal with       
     this complex problem.

397
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,400
Or maybe...           
    maybe I'm a complex guy

398
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,400
trying to deal with       
a simple problem, I don't know.

399
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,000
What do you think, Father?

400
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,300
Am I to understand that     
 you had relations with a woman

401
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,100
who is not your wife?

402
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes. That's, uh...

403
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,900
that's correct, Father.

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,800
Uh, what do I need to do?

405
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,100
Say three Hail Marys...

406
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,800
...four Our Fathers       
    and nine rosaries.

407
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,400
Thank you, Father.

408
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
Nine rosaries? That's a lot.

409
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,700
We're cracking down.

410
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,700
You mean that I...          
    I have to do that

411
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,700
for each one of these beads?

412
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,300
Hey, it's not a
            religion for wusses.

413
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,400
CLIFF:             
    You know, uh, Sam,

414
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,300
we all feel kind of bad

415
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,300
about what you're               
going through and...

416
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
as much as we live              
vicariously through you

417
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,200
when you score, we...           
also feel vicarious pain

418
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
when you strike out.

419
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,200
So what's the deal?

420
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,200
Are you gonna snap out
          of this by the weekend

421
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,500
or do we have to go
         rent a Matt Helm movie?

422
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm fine.

423
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Can we just drop        
      the subject, please?

424
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,500
Sam, is something troubling you?

425
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Do you need to talk to someone?

426
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,500
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do 
    need to talk to someone.

427
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,500
I need to talk         
    to everybody here.

428
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,800
I don't know why
                it's taken me

429
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
so long to get this out here,  
but last night, in that office,

430
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,700
Rebecca Howe and I had...

431
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,500
uh, a disagreement about those 
shelves I was telling you about.

432
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,100
Uh, you know, I'm gonna     
      put them up anyway.

433
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,400
You know, what the heck.

434
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
They'll be good for knickknacks 
        and everything.

435
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,500
I think they're gonna look,   
        uh, fine.

436
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Matt Helm never had       
    to build shelves.

437
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,800
(knocks on door)

438
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,000
Hi, Sam.                        
                      Hi.

439
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,200
I didn't expect to see you here.

440
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,000
I just came back                
for my final paycheck

441
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,900
and there seems                 
to be some mistake.

442
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's only for $16.

443
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,600
Oh, darn those computers.

444
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,300
How can they make   
            a mistake like that?

445
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,700
It was supposed   
            to be for six.

446
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,300
You got a ten on you?

447
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,800
This isn't about                
a silly check.

448
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,000
Give me the check.

449
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
This is about us.

450
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
What about us?

451
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,600
Sam, we have been friends for  
too long to let it end this way.

452
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,300
And I just came                 
back to say

453
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,000
that I'm sorry I ran out    
    earlier in a huff

454
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,900
and that I knew you

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
weren't coming on to me,

456
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,800
and that when you               
said I wasn't good,

457
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
that it wasn't just some trick 
    to get me back into bed,

458
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,500
it was because you were     
         being honest,

459
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,800
because I am a lousy lover.

460
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
No, sweetheart,         
    you're not lou...

461
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,000
No, Sam,                        
it's all right.

462
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,200
It's not like I haven't     
        heard it before.

463
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,500
I have to learn to accept it.

464
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
You know, some people      
        are bad at math.

465
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,500
Some people can't skip.

466
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,800
No, no...

467
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
You're a fantastic lover.

468
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,200
I am a dud and I know it.

469
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Robin just didn't realize it  
     because he's English.

470
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,000
Listen, I wouldn't say you
    were good if you weren't.

471
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
Maybe I just, you know,
         wasn't too enthusiastic

472
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
this morning because my
             feelings were hurt.

473
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
I mean, the minute
            he comes in here,

474
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
you act as if   
            nothing happened.

475
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,300
No... no, no.

476
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,700
Sam, that doesn't wash.

477
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
You have been after
             me for three years.

478
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
And you finally got me.

479
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,400
I mean,             
    if I was even adequate,

480
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,600
I know that you would      
    have run out there

481
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,700
and told every bozo       
          in the bar.

482
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,600
You don't think I wasn't    
    dying to do that?

483
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,400
It was making me crazy.

484
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,000
It's just that I thought that  
I'd be betraying our friendship.

485
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,900
I never really had          
        a friend before.

486
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
You have lots of friends.

487
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,900
No, no, I never "had"      
        a friend before.

488
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,700
It's weird.

489
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,300
I don't know                    
how to behave.

490
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,100
I don't...

491
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,900
So you really, really did this

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,800
out of respect         
      for our friendship?

493
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Uh-huh.

494
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,200
Sort of... sort of like     
     you were being noble?

495
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,700
Well, I...

496
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,100
Yeah, I guess so.           
        I guess...

497
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,300
And, uh, I wasn't lousy?

498
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,900
No. You were fantastic.

499
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,200
Look, you want me               
to prove it to you,

500
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,900
I'll go out there and tell      
them that we made love.

501
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,600
No, no, no, no, Sam, no.

502
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,300
It's enough

503
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,500
just knowing you're
             willing to do that.

504
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,900
No, I think you need more.

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,100
No, no, no.

506
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,500
No, Sam, don't give
            up your nobility.

507
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,200
Aw, come on.

508
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Let, a noble guy                
have some fun here.

509
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh! I get it: you   
              want to tell them.

510
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
Yeah. It's a guy thing,         
      you know.

511
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,700
At least let me tell Carla.

512
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,500
Okay, go ahead.

513
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,100
Really?                         
        Yes, yes, you've done   
        a lot for me; it's fine.

514
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Yeah, this friendship stuff's   
gonna to be fantastic.

515
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Yes...

516
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Hey, guys, guys,
                 listen up here.

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
(laughing)

518
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,000
Uh, last night...

519
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,000
Rebecca and I made love,

520
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,800
and she was fabulous.

521
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,100
(sighing deeply):              
      Well...

522
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,100
...this has got to be      
  the saddest day of my life.

523
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,400
What?

524
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,200
Sammy, you never had      
to resort to lying before.

525
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,600
What, you don't believe me?

526
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,500
First of all, why would you   
  wait a whole day to tell us?

527
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,300
And second of all--

528
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,900
she was fabulous?!

529
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,900
Sammy,

530
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
come on, let's go           
     look at those shelves.

531
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
No, no, really,
              I was being noble.

532
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,600
No, really, I was fabulous.
