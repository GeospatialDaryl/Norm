00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:06,988
Hi, everybody.          
        Sorry i'm late.

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,157
I was at another           
     business seminar.

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,176
This one was all about      
    accentuating the positive

5
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:14,262
and all you can accomplish  
    by focusing on the good     
    instead of the bad.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,897
Yeah, how was it?              
             The worst.

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,049
But, you know,          
        i like the idea

8
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:20,085
of positive reinforcement   
    in the workplace.

9
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:21,770
So i'm gonna    
                give it a shot.

10
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:24,673
Man, you've gotta be           
 a real moron                   
 to buy that load of crap.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,857
Way to speak out,  
             carla.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,346
Oh! Way to pour    
             that beer, woody!

13
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:33,581

         that tab, norm.

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,818

         a new haircut.

16
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:42,607
No.

My, uh, thumbnail       
        grew back.

18
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:47,946
No.

19
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,965
But just give me        
        a little time.

20
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:52,200
[Stammering]

Uh, he'll be back in a minute.

Well, i want                   
 let him know right away,

35
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,767

 I'm afraid he has

00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:01,335
a serious blockage.

37
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:03,087
Oh, my god, his heart?

38
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,557
No, his fuel line.          
    I'm sam's mechanic.

39
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:11,045
Oh, my god.        
             It's the corvette.

40
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:13,715
Why couldn't            
        it have been his heart?

41
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,599
Hi, guys.

42
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,568

43
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:19,103
Uh, sam.

44
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,805
At the rate that           
     i'm saving the bucks,

45
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,308
cheers is gonna be mine again  
 in a few short months.

46
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,675
And when i'm        
            runnin' this place,

47
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,160
things are                 
     gonna be different.

48
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,562
How?

49
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,081
I'll be runnin' the place.

50
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,416
So, you really been            
 socking it away,               
 huh, sam?

51
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:35,453
Yeah, yeah.                    
 I wish i had a nickel          
 for every dollar i've saved.

52
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,838
Just this week

53
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,056
by, uh, skipping lunches,  
     workin' overtime,

54
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:41,426
and having         
             sex-only dates,

55
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,895
i've managed to save       
     over $200.

56
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:45,146
Oh,

57
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,298
this means,            
         you only owe me $130.

58
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,467
W-what?                        
 My retainer's all gone?

59
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:54,672
Well, i can't be               
 too mad at the guy.

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,942
He gave me                 
     a radiator flush           
     for my birthday.

61
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,594
Sam, you're never  
             gonna buy the bar  
             back at this rate.

62
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:01,912
What can i do?

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,015
I'm tapped out by the time     
 i pay for gas,

64
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,317
and tune-ups,

65
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:08,370
and philipe         
            the chamois boy.

66
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:09,437
Why don't you sell the car?

67
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,389
[All gasping]

68
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,873
it's just a car.

69
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,825
[Gasping]

70
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,777

         honey...

71
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,581
let me explain                 
 something to you here.

72
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,015
We're not talkin'       
        about just a car.

73
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,516
We're talkin' about        
     sammy's vette.

74
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,953
The stud-mobile,       
         the babe-catcher.

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,955
You're right,      
             you're right.

76
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,456
I mean,                
         where would sam be

77
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,191
without his crutch?

78
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:31,309
You know,              
         all those years,

79
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,960
those women weren't    
         making love to you.

80
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:34,812
They were making love  
         to your car.

81
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,947
No, that's where           
     you're wrong.

82
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,583
They were making love       
    in my car.

83
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,736
Really?            
         Come on.

84
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,389
Girls don't go out with me     
 just because of my car.

85
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,157
That's right.              
     All the women in boston

86
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,260
are just lining up  
            to go out           
            with sam malone

87
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,211
and his bus pass.

88
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,330
What do you mean?              
 No, forget you.

89
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,732
I don't need that car          
 to catch babes.

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,101
I could sell that car today    
 if i wanted to.

91
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,137
In fact, if i did,          
    i'd have a down payment     
    on--on cheers, here.

92
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,573
And pretty soon,               
 i'd have a roomful of babes.

93
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:05,209
And where there are babes,     
 there are guys buying drinks.

94
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,245
Before you know it,            
 i'd be rollin' in dough.

95
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:10,749
Pretty soon                 
    i might even be able        
    to afford a corvette.

96
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,936
That's it.                     
 I'm selling the sucker.

97
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:18,139
Afternoon, everybody.

98
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,540
(All)              
             norm!

99
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,425
Hey, mr. Peterson.     
         Got room for beer?

100
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,695
No, but i am willing        
    to add on.

101
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,134
(Cliff)                    
     so, hey, uh, normie,

102
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,351
so, how's business goin'?

103
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:31,452
Lousy, cliffie.

104
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,054
I'm so damn busy painting,

105
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,556
i haven't had time     
         to stop in here

106
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,007
and visit with my best friend.

107
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,958
I missed you, too,     
         you big lug.

108
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,912
Well, actually, cliffie,   
     i meant mr. Beer.

109
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,883
So, the painting business   
    is that good, huh?

110
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,417
Too good, woody.

111
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:49,754
Like today i had        
        to choose between       
        2 really great jobs.

112
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,056
Couldn't make up my mind.

113
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,390
So what did you do?

114
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,209
Ah, skipped them both.     
     Came in here.

115
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,962
I think i made         
         the right choice.

116
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,064
Why don't you just             
 hire someone to help you?

117
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,615
Right, norm.                   
 Hire an assistant.

118
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:03,451
Yeah?  
 Look here. All right.

119
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:05,119
If you double                  
 your work force,

120
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:07,155
and you divide                 
 total man hours in half,

121
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:09,674
that equals a 50%              
 work reduction for you,

122
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:11,776
and profits will go up  
        proportionately.

123
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,711
[Whooping]                 
     good idea, woody.

124
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:14,929
Yeah, good one, woodman.

125
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,114
Thanks, guys.

126
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,816
What about my part?

127
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,134
What part was that?

128
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,437
The part where i took  
         woody's vague, inane

129
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:25,139
seed of an idea,       
         and made it blossom.   
         Remember?

130
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,141
Oh, shame on you, rebecca.

131
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,411
Trying to bump woody    
        out of the spotlight.

132
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,213
All woody did was  
             say "get help."

133
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,731
I'm the one        
             that made it work.

134
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,332
Oh, if you say so.

135
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,918
I did say so.

136
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,720
I don't know,  
                 woody.

137
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:41,990
I mean, uh,

138
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:43,541
how would           
            i even get started?

139
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:46,060
W-w-where can i find    
        somebody with           
        the appropriate skills?

140
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,445
Look, if you really            
 need some help,

141
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,096
i could sure use the work.

142
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,615
I don't know, pal.

143
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,650
I never hired anybody      
     before, you know.

144
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,885
Feel kind of weird about it.

145
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,853
I wouldn't even know       
     what to ask you.

146
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,223
Well, while you're             
 thinking about it,             
 can i buy you a beer?

147
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,824
Welcome aboard.

148
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,648
[Sighing]

149
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,367
oh, there you are.

150
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,468
I did it.

151
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,203
I put the corvette 
             in the paper.

152
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,771
Pretty snappy, huh?

153
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,174
"For sale: corvette.       
     Meet chicks."

154
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,591
I like that.

155
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:23,380
Hey, norm,                 
     i hear business is good.

156
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,849
Yeah, i guess.

157
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,117
You guess?

158
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,718
Word is                 
        you hired 3 new people,

159
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:30,004
and you're shuttling   
         between 2 jobs.

160
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,724
Just goes to show you          
 what good business advice is

161
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,825
when it comes          
         from a professional.

162
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:38,179
Rebecca's still                
 trying to take credit          
 for woody's idea, huh?

163
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,014
It was my idea.

164
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:41,449
Oh, sure, it was,              
 miss howe.

165
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,951
You thought it up              
 all by yourself.

166
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,639
You were saying, norm?

167
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:50,174
Well, i--i just can't  
         get used to

168
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,226
bossing people around, 
         you know?

169
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:55,613
Can't seem to make         
     my workers do the things   
     they're supposed to.

170
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,315
Like increase           
        their productivity,

171
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,783
exceed their goals,

172
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,084
show up.

173
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,486
You're not letting 
             your employees

174
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,021
take advantage of you, 
         are you?

175
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,107
Yeah, maybe a little bit.  
     I mean,

176
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,642
yesterday afternoon,

177
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,628
the guys decide        
         to knock off early,    
         and just go bowling.

178
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,763
[Sighing]          
             so what'd you do?

179
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,364
I broke 200.

180
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,499
Hey, all right!

181
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,601
Thank you.     
                 Personal high. 
                 It was great.

182
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,651
Oh, mr. P.

183
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,003
[Clicking tongue]

184
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,905
that's very            
         irresponsible, norm.

185
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:24,342
As the boss, you have  
         to show these people   
         an example.

186
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,928
Yeah, i guess          
         you're right, woody.

187
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,930
But i--i cannot be

188
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,864
one of these           
         hard-nosed bosses, ok?

189
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:33,485
I mean, i've had    
            bosses like that.   
            I hate those guys.

190
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,753
Being in charge is not     
     a popularity contest.

191
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:39,173
(Rebecca)                      
 you are not in business        
 to get people to like you.

192
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,775
Now, i don't get           
     why you would care         
     what your employees think.

193
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:44,128
I don't care.          
         Obviously not.

194
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,399
What is that        
            supposed to mean?

195
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,868
Nothing.                       
                No.

196
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,588
You already said it.           
 Don't just leave me dangling.

197
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:56,641
I mean, i do have feelings,    
 for god's sake.

198
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:59,710
I'm sorry. We like you.

199
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,512
Really? Thank you.

200
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,019
Yeah, it's not like 
            i'm a total washout 
            as a boss.

201
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:10,287
I mean,                
         yesterday afternoon,   
         for example,

202
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,622
after we, uh,  
                 went bowling,

203
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,457
i really laid down the law 
     with my guys.

204
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,560
I said if we're    
             gonna get anywhere 
             as a company,

205
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,828
we've gotta         
            really buckle down.

206
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,730
But, uh,

207
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,182
i think i may have     
         to lean on them        
         a little bit harder.

208
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,667
How come?          
        That's them coming out  
        of the pool room.

209
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,503
Norm! Hey, guys,               
 look who it is.

210
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,138
Hey!

211
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,839
How's it goin',    
             mr. 200?           
 Hey, come on, come on.

212
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,308
Hey, get these guys        
     a drink.

213
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,260
Hey, hey, norm,        
         we're gonna go         
         watch the secretaries

214
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,945
walk out                    
    of the prudential building.

215
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,379
Wanna come? It's windy.

216
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:36,881
All right!

217
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,916
[All chattering]        
         we've got norm.        
         Let's go.

218
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,218
Hey, whoa,     
                 whoa, fellas.

219
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,320
Shouldn't we be over    
        at shannon's, you know, 
        painting?

220
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,222
I don't wanna be        
        a slave driver          
        or anything.

221
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,590
But, uh, i thought 
             maybe we'd

222
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,191
get on that 2nd coat   
         today, huh?

223
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,326
[Laughing]

224
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,110
no, no. I mean, 
                we did get      
                the first coat,

225
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,329
didn't we?

226
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:52,914
[Rudy laughing]

227
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,715
damn!

228
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,584
I cannot believe            
    those guys are goin' off

229
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:58,402
to the prudential building     
 right now.

230
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,355
They're really a bunch     
     of goof-offs, aren't they?

231
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,556
I'll tell you, man,            
 everybody knows                
 the hancock building

232
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:05,559
is pantyhose heaven.           
 The wind whips up...

233
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,611
is there a sam malone here?

234
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah, speaking.

235
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,831
I'm dennis hammill.            
 I'm here about the corvette.

236
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,633
Great. Dennis,             
     have a seat right there.

237
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:13,951
I can't wait to see it.

238
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,036
Whoa, slow down there.         
 Slow down.

239
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:19,723
First we have to learn  
        a little bit about you  
        here, dennis.

240
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,226
About me?              
                        Yeah.

241
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,744
Yeah, you see,

242
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,631
matching a corvette            
 with the right owner, dennis,

243
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,198
is kind of like

244
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,401
findin' a home         
         for an animal.

245
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,102
Except an animal's     
         just an animal,

246
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,505
and we're talkin'      
         about a corvette.

247
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,257
Ok, but i'm kind of            
 pressed for time.

248
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,259
I've gotta get             
     to my hair stylist.        
                    Good. Good.

249
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,678
Oh, yeah, very good,   
         very good.

250
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,231
Hair stylist.  
                 All right.

251
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,249
All right, this will be    
     pretty simple here.

252
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,385
Just a few, uh,            
     multiple-choice questions.

253
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,436
Great. Shoot.

254
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,920
Number one:

255
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:51,606
it's high noon.

256
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,207
You're driving         
         in harvard square.

257
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,308
Parking's limited.

258
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,910
Do you,                        
 a: park in a handicapped zone,

259
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:59,847
b: park in a regular spot  
     under a tree,

260
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:03,217
c: drive around            
     till a space opens up?

261
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,170
"C."               
         What, are you nuts?

262
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,022
Can't believe it, man! 
         It's a trick question.

263
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,324
You don't drive this baby  
     at high noon, man!

264
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,626
Sun damage, bucko!

265
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:12,960
What the hell's                
 wrong with you?

266
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:14,828
What do you want to do?        
 Oxidize the paint?

267
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:17,331
Get out of here!        
        You make me sick!       
        Can't believe it.

268
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,968
He wants to drive      
         my car, at high noon,  
         in harvard square.

269
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,261
Damn!              
             It's still busy.

270
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,163
How can those guys         
     be on the phone all day?

271
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,931
They're supposed   
             to be painting.

272
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,901
You know, in the future, uh,   
 telephones will be obsolete.

273
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,803
Yeah?      
     Yeah, absolutely right.

274
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,205
See, people will communicate   
 telekinetically

275
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,774
using part of their brain      
 known as the cerebral cortex

276
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:46,143
that, uh,                  
     is heretofore untapped.

277
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,678
May i?          
             Yeah.

278
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,188
Been tapped now.

280
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,373
cheers.

281
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,325
Oh, yeah. For you.

282
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,210
Hello.

283
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,678
Rudy, rudy. Yes.

284
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,614
I've been trying to get ahold  
 of you all afternoon.

285
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,081
Look, man, i got--

286
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,550
you're kidding.

287
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,051
Well, that's great!

288
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,403
Hey, you guys!

289
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,671
My crew                 
        just won great seats    
        for the patriots game.

290
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,808
They've been               
     on the phone all afternoon 
     with the w.G.A.Z.

291
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,643
Hey, that's fantastic, 
         ruds.

292
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,829
Uh, listen, rudy, man, 
         uh, not to, uh,

293
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:24,264
randomly change topics, 
        or anything, but, uh,

294
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,567
you guys get           
         any work done today?

295
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,635
[People chattering]

296
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,370
uh-huh.

297
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,739
Yeah, well, you know,  
         i suppose that area    
         by the phone

298
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,941
needed about       
             8 or 9 coats.

299
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,109
Yeah, just keep it up.

300
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:41,014
Ah, i should have never 
        listened to rebecca.

301
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,602
Let's face it, man.

302
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,821
I am incapable             
     of bossing anybody around.

303
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,541
I wish i could              
    hire somebody else          
    to be the damn tough guy.

304
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,559
No, no. I mean,                
 your situation                 
 puts me in mind

305
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:54,895
of a wonderful play            
 by bertolt brecht.             
                        Yeah?

306
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,697
Yes. It's about        
         a poor put-upon woman

307
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:59,099
who, similar to you,           
 is having trouble              
 dealing with the people

308
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,786
that are taking                
 advantage of her.              
 Oh, what'd she do?

309
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:04,588
Well, she developed        
     an entirely new            
     and different personality

310
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:05,857
to handle these people.

311
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,491
It's set in the orient.        
 It's called

312
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,126
<i>the good woman of setzuan.</i>

313
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,694
Mmm. Sounds good.

314
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,080
Oh, yes,                       
 it's one of                    
 brecht's masterpieces.

315
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:15,315
No, i mean,    
                 chinese food.

316
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,117
I know a great place.  
         Phone book, woody?

317
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,570
I don't know why i try         
 to have an intellectual        
 conversation

318
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,106
with the 2 of you.             
 All you ever think about is...

319
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,042
say, how's their               
 kung pao shrimp?

320
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:26,694
Norm, wait a minute.       
                     What?

321
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:29,613
Before you order,              
 i think you should get         
 your business in order.

322
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,016
Now it's important,            
 that you straighten            
 out this employee deal

323
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,384
before it goes any further.

324
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,103
Don't you think, woody?

325
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,640
Well, if you say so,   
         woody.

326
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,625
I'll call the guys back.

327
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:45,178
This bertolt brecht,   
         did he write any plays 
         about rib joints?

328
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,765
Hi, rudy, rudy, 
                hi, it's norm.

329
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,601
Listen, i'm afraid     
         i have some bad news

330
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:52,936
about your, uh,     
            patriots game plans 
            this weekend.

331
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,007
Uh, i think you guys   
         are going to have      
         to kind of work.

332
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:58,275
No, no, no, no.     
            Relax. It's not me.

333
00:12:58,343 --> 00:12:59,877
It's my new        
             business partner.

334
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:01,879
That's good, good.         
     Now give the guy a name.   
     Make it authentic.

335
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,714
Uh, it's this guy, 
             mr. Kreitzer.

336
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:07,901
He has this crazy idea,    
     man, that you guys should, 
     i don't know, paint.

337
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,636
What?

338
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:10,971
He wants               
         to talk to kreitzer.

339
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,673
Help, frasier. 
 No, no, no.                    
 You dug the hole.

00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,692

             you're an actor.

341
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,726
Be kreitzer, come on.

342
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,177
All right.                 
     Uh, where am i from?

343
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:18,646
Uh, pittsburgh.     
         Ok. Now...

344
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:22,433
did i come                     
 from a happy childhood, or...

345
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,601
and why am i on the phone   
    at this point in my life?

346
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:25,936
Oh, come on.           
         Give me the phone.

347
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,339
Forget it, forget it,  
         forget it.

348
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,442
All right,          
            this is kreitzer.

349
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,278
Now listen up,         
         you bunch of gutless,

350
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,113
sniveling little wimps!

351
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,714
I don't care           
         what peterson said!

352
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,517
That lowlife does not  
         lay down the rules!

Hey, hey. Any more     
         lip out of you

354
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,687
and i'll rip your face off,

355
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:46,056
and stick it up        
         your lunch bucket!

[People chattering]

357
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,932
that was kind of fun.

358
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,668
I think maybe              
     i ought to call vera, huh? 
     What do you say?

359
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,661
Hey, where is sam?

360
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:09,630
He'll be right back.           
 He just, uh,

361
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,682
sold his vette,        
         and he's pickin' up    
         his new car.

362
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,417
Oh, yeah,          
             what did he get?   
             The turbo "z"?

00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:14,702

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,138
Oh, poor sam.

366
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,457
Yeah. He just called       
     from the used car circus.

367
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,660
It must have been          
     the ringmaster's special.

368
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:24,895
Anyways, he was really         
 a little depressed about it,

369
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,130
so maybe we just shouldn't 
     mention it, all right.

370
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,099
Oh, yeah.

371
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,000

375
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,975
You got something              
 to say to me, just say it.

379
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,466
I'll tell you what.

00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,435
Go ahead.              
         Take a 5-minute break  
         for lunch.

381
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:50,738

         you're hungry,         
         we all have to eat.

382

We're only human.

383
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:53,907
But i'll tell you what,

384
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:56,777
if kreitzer asks,          
     i did not say any of this.

385
00:14:57,895 --> 00:14:59,196
Oh, i must say,

386
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,298
this kreitzer stuff        
     is going very, very well.

387
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,667
I told the guys they           
 gotta work a few               
 extra nights next week,

388
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,051
they didn't even say boo.

389
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,420
I love being kreitzer.

390
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,141
I don't have to paint anymore, 
 right? Business is booming.

391
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,043
I've hired a secretary.    
     I've rented us offices.

392
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,978
Norm, when you say us...

393
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:16,363
yeah.                      
             Who do you mean?

394
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,848
Well, me and kreitzer.

395
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,766
When you say kreitzer,     
     who do you mean?

396
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:20,801
Me.

397
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,170
When you say me...

398
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:24,337
[chuckling]                
     no, frasier,

399
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,206
don't worry about it.          
 I'm not going crazy.

400
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:27,775
It's just a front. You see,

401
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,944
my--my office door actually 
    leads into an office.

402
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:32,029
But kreitzer's door         
    opens out to the back alley

403
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,731
where they keep    
             the garbage.

404
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,350
Yeah,                      
     well, both offices are     
     furnished about the same.

405
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,485
Hey, normie,                   
 how did you think up           
 that name kreitzer?

406
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,704
You know,                  
     i've been meaning          
     to ask the same thing.

407
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,140
What was he,               
     a bully back in school?

408
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,275
A sadistic c.O.                
 Back in the coast guard?

409
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,544
Authority figure               
 who used to torment you?

410
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,713
No, no, no, no.            
     It's vera's maiden name.

411
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,467
Sam, is what i heard true?

412
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,436
Did you get a new ferrari?

413
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,104
No, volare.

414
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,672
Ooh.

415
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:01,058
Hey, sammy is still sammy. 
     Babes are still babes.

416
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,360
And i don't need a fancy car   
 to catch them.

417
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,429
As a matter of fact,        
    when i was pullin' up here,

418
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,697
there were             
         a couple of twins

419
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,381
who couldn't take      
         their eyes off of me.

420
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,701
Uh, fellas, twins ahoy.

421
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,871
Hello, lovely ladies.   
        Can i help you?

422
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,122
Are you the man            
     we just saw

423
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:17,207
getting out of             
     a volare out front?

424
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,792
A little passion       
         beige number?

425
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,093
Could be, could be.

426
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,278
My god, it was him!

427
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,946
And he admitted it!

428
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,637
I wonder               
         who your corvette's    
         dating tonight.

429
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,890
I gotta get my car back.

430
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,309
Hey, norm!          
                     Rudy!

431
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,027
Hey, norm, we gotta 
            talk to kreitzer.

432
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,762
Now, we ain't takin'   
         his crap anymore.

433
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,264
Well, what's the matter,   
     fellas?

434
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,198
Oh, man,           
             it's everything.

435
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,999
We had to give up       
        those football tickets.

436
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,067
We have to             
         work weekends.

437
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:45,603
Now he wants us                
 to work nights, too.

438
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,053
I'll tell you          
         something else.

439
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,989
The thing we hate most         
 is the way he's treatin' you.

440
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,757
Fellas, look,                  
 i'll tell you what i'll do.

441
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:52,342
Uh, i'll give the guy  
         a call, ok.

442
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,927
And i'll see       
             if i can get him   
             to ease up

443
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:55,946
on the hours a little bit. 
     It's all i can do.

444
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,264
Yeah, ok. Thanks, norm.

445
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,049
You know, 'cause           
     i'll tell you something,

446
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,317
just because       
             we're out there

447
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,486
standing in that hot sun   
     all day,

448
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,905
breathin' turpentine fumes,    
 you know,                      
 that doesn't mean that we...

449
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,757
[people chattering]

450
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:12,496
sheesh! Forgot         
         what i was gonna say.

451
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:15,865
Heck! It doesn't matter.

452
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,434
Well, see you later,   
         norm.

453
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,552
Ok, come on,       
             let's go.

454
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,641
(Frasier)               
        you know, norm,         
        you might bear in mind

455
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,626
that you can be    
             pushing these guys 
             a bit too far.

456
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,828
Come on, frasier, the key      
 to being a good executive

457
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,980
is knowing when to be firm     
 and when to be fair.

458
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,565
Uh, norm?              
     Yeah?

459
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,550
Look, the guys and i decided   
 you don't have a spine,

460
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:37,788
so we're just gonna        
     to kreitzer's office       
     and bash his skull in.

461
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,356
I'm dead.              
         I'm absolutely dead.

462
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,341
I think                 
        there's a little lesson 
        to be learned here.

463
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,410
You've allowed the evil side   
 of your nature to rise up,

464
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,612
and now it threatens   
         to destroy everything  
         you've built.

465
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,646
Let it go no farther.

466
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:48,715
Time has come to reject 
        your darker self.

467
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:51,085
Well, thank you,            
    obi-wan kenobi.

468
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:53,820
All right, that's it.

469
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,672
I just got to go over there    
 and dump kreitzer altogether.

470
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,641
I just hope i can beat  
        those guys over there.

471
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,610
Um, my volare's right outside. 
 I'll give you a lift.

472
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,961
I love you, sammy.

473
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:03,797
Congratulations, sam.   
        I see you finally got   
        yourself a date.

474
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,167
I got to get my car back.

475
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,949
Thank god. Sammy,           
    you made great time.

476
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,336
Whoa. Yeah, it's amazing   
     how fast you can go

477
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:28,939
when you don't give            
 a damn what happens            
 to your car.

478
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,040
Doris.             
                     Hi.

479
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,408
Doris, hi.

480
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,193
Anybody been here          
     to see mr. Kreitzer?

481
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:34,444
Oh, no.

482
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:36,680
Mr. Kreitzer's left me      
    very specific instructions.

483
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,283
He is not to be disturbed  
     under any circumstances.

484
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,402
[Chuckling]                
     great.

485
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:43,787
Mr. Kreitzer's very demanding.

486
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,090
Doris, honey. Hasn't it 
        ever, uh, struck you

487
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,410
that you've never  
             seen the man?

488
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,912
All i know is,

489
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:55,115
this is the best job    
        i've ever had.

490
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:58,285
I mean, sure mr. Kreitzer  
     chews me out on the phone  
     now and then,

491
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,986
but i deserve it.

492
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:06,577
Actually, i was hoping     
     you were mr. Kreitzer.

493
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:12,783
Actually, uh, doris,   
         i'm doing a little     
         research here.

494
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,419
As a woman, would           
    you ever consider going out

495
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,821
with someone           
         who drives a volare?

496
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,190
Are you kidding?

497
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,992
I drive one myself.

498
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,479
It used to be my mother's.

499
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,569
I gotta get my car back.

500
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:34,204
Whoa, whoa!                
        All right,              
        where is he?

501
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,106
Yeah. Where's kreitzer? 
             Calm down, fellas.

502
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,708
Yeah. Just let me get  
         a couple of minutes    
         with him. Ok? I'm sure

503
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,811
he'll listen to reason. Ok?    
 He'll listen to reason

504
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,379
after i kill him               
 a few times.

505
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,398
Mr. Kreitzer's given me        
 very specific instructions.

506
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:46,667
He's not to be disturbed       
 under any circumstances.

507
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,852
Right, doris. I take       
     full responsibility, ok?

508
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,587
But i have                     
 some instructions.

509
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,257
Just give me                   
 2 minutes with him,            
 ok. He will be mine.

510
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,911
I'm--i'm so        
             very sorry, sir!

511
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,648
Peterson, you clumsy ox!

512
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:05,436
You just kicked over   
         a macintosh-8000 c.X.!

513
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,321
(Norm)                         
 look, i'm really sorry, sir.

514
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,756
Sir, we have a big         
     problem on our hands.

515
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:12,292
The crew is just           
     ready to revolt, sir.

516
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,845
And i'm telling you,       
     i don't like the way       
     you abuse my guys

517
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:17,147
with personal insults.

518
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:19,166
Your butt's too big!

519
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:25,205
Now, sir, that is          
     just the kind of stuff     
     i'm talkin' about, ok.

520
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:26,756
(Norm)                  
        all right, sir,

521
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:29,326
i'm gonna have to quit     
     and i'm taking my crew     
     with me.

522
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,044
Peterson, you can't do that!

523
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:34,214
Oh, don't beg, anton.  
         It doesn't become you.

524
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:35,299
[Sighing]

525
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,001
way to go, norm.

526
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,335
All right, fellas.

527
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,521
Jeez, norm, you had            
 no right to do that.           
                     What?

528
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:43,090
Now you've really upset him.

529
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:45,208
What are you talking about? 
    We don't need him.

530
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:46,726
You can work for me.    
     Norm, look.

531
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,745
No offense.                
     You're a nice guy,

532
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,380
but you're not                 
 boss material.

533
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:51,782
Hey, everybody knows        
    mr. Kreitzer

534
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,800
was the brains             
     behind everything.

535
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,953
Can you call him later     
     and tell him we had        
     nothing to do with this?

536
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:00,290
Don't worry. I'll make sure    
 he gets a message.

537
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,091
Fellas, come back here!        
 Wait a minute!

538
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,194
Hey. All right, fine!

539
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,230
Go ahead! Who needs you?

540
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,298
[Sighing]

541
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,751
thank you, doris.

542
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,286
Sammy.                 
                         Yeah?

543
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,155
Think my butt's too big?       
                         No.

544
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,646
Hello.                  
        This is anton kreitzer!

545
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,481
I'm calling about       
        the corvette you bought

546
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,001
from a mr. Sam malone!

547
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:30,687
Yeah, well,             
        give it back right now!

548
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,090
No, no, no.            
         Come on, no, no.

549
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:34,724
Don't hang up,              
    don't hang up. Please.

550
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,493
It's not kreitzer,         
     it's sam.

551
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,996
I want my car back.        
     Please? Listen, i...

552
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:41,598
i'm having seller's remorse.

553
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:43,299
Uh, i-- listen,        
         i'll tell you what.

554
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,236
Uh--uh, i'll pay you $500 more 
 than you bought it for.

555
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:47,404
All right. Wait, wait, wait.

556
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,406
I'll pay you $1,000 more   
     than you bought it for.

557
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:50,457
Excuse me, sam.

558
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,209
Can you hold on        
         just a second, please?

559
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,410
As a trained psychiatrist,

560
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,445
and well-versed in the art     
 of human persuasion,

561
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,915
i think i can handle this      
 for you.

562
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,186
Lilith, damn it! Give sam      
 his car back immediately!

563
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,188
There.

564
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:07,741
I've been getting tired        
 of those speeding tickets.

565
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:11,728
Hey, ruds!

566
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,496
Look, i gotta talk     
         to you a minute.

567
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:15,615
Hey, i knew you guys   
         wouldn't let me down.  
         What do you say?

568
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:17,767
You ready,             
         to get back to work?   
 Just slow down a second.

569
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:19,403
What?

570
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,138
All right, look.

571
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:24,157
A couple of hours              
 after you left,                
 i went back to the office.

572
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:26,092
Now, i think you know          
 what i found.

573
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,995
Oh, yeah, well,        
         that, uh, see i can--

574
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:30,614
then, i finally started    
     piecin' it together.

575
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,417
Why i never saw         
        a norm peterson         
        and mr. Kreitzer

576
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,184
in the same room,          
     at the same time,

577
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:38,221
or why you happened        
     to be in the office        
     when we got there.

578
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,541
This whole thing               
 was a masquerade,              
 wasn't it?

579
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:41,592
Yeah.

580
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,877
I can't believe         
        we fell for it!

581
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:46,213
You know, all this time    
     we thought you were        
     just a sweet,

582
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,682
beer-guzzling lug              
 named norm peterson.

583
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,134
Well, the jig is up,           
 kreitzer!                      
                     What?

584
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,904
Oh, man. That's pretty slick,  
 pretending to be a nice guy

585
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,172
so you could spy on us.

586
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,840
Wait a second, man.    
         You go it all wrong.

587
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,443
Save it for the stage,         
 anton!

588
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,278
Man, this is reality!

589
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,680
All--all--all right,    
        i am kreitzer!

590
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:05,415
Do you wanna            
        go back to work for me?

591
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,250
Yeah, man. I'd love            
 working for a psycho.

592
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:08,585
God, man, you're pathetic.

593
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,220
Wait, wait a minute.   
         Rudy, rudy, rudy.

594
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,489
Come on, now.           
        I'm not kreitzer,       
        i'm norm peterson.

595
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:14,858
I swear to god.        
         I can prove it to you. 
         Watch this.

596
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:16,710
Uh, afternoon, everyone.

597
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:18,077
(All)              
             anton!
