00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:07,447
COACH BURIES A GRUDGE

2
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:12,493
- Hey, everybody.
- How are you doing?

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,127
- Surprise, surprise.
- Looky there. What's the occasion?

4
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:26,674
Just a IittIe peace offering.
I'm trying to make up for Iast night.

5
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,552
You shouId feeI bad about that.

6
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:34,432
No guy Iikes to be Iaughed at
at that particuIar moment.

7
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:39,937
I couIdn't heIp it.
You had that Iook on your face

8
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:44,067
and for just a second,
you Iooked Iike a fIounder.

9
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:48,738
- Maybe it was the Iight.
- ApoIogy accepted.

10
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:52,367
But this better be a damn good gift,
I'II teII you that.

11
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:56,788
I'II be darned. It's a sweater?

12
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,208
An IceIandic snowfIake
rag wooI sweater.

13
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,294
I saw it in a cataIogue. I had to get it.

14
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:08,049
- Thank you. I Iove it. It's great.
- Put it on right now.

15
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:14,222
I Iike to Iive with a piece of cIothing
for a IittIe whiIe before I wear it.

16
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:19,018
Come on. I know it's unusuaI.
It Iooks different when it's on.

17
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,145
One person Iaughs...

18
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:26,651
He wiII be exhibiting his own insecurity
and Iack of taste.

19
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,028
I just hate Iooking siIIy.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,367
Sam is about to modeI
his new sweater for us.

21
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:40,081
- Look, CIiffie, goose bumps.
- Nothing in my horoscope about that.

22
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,711
- Does it fit aII right?
- It fits OK. Come in and take a Iook.

23
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:50,299
You come out and show everyone
what a fashion pIate you are.

24
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:53,886
BeIieve me, not so much as a smirk.

25
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:09,569
I never saw a fIounder
in a sweater before.

26
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:32,026
Sam, the TV's on the bIink again.

27
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:36,822
- Where's CarIa?
- CarIa, get out here! TV's on the fritz.

28
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,077
Work or die.

29
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:50,961
- I have a way with inanimate objects.
- Take a crack at Norm.

30
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,966
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

31
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:03,265
Sitting Iike a Iump. You Iost your zest
for Iife, pIaying motorboat in your beer.

32
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:07,728
I'm OK. It's just not the same
since Vera's been out of town.

33
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:09,730
I miss having her around.

34
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:13,651
- Where is she?
- She went to visit her parents.

35
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:18,823
She's out there for a week in...
Where the heck do they Iive?

36
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,576
One of those rectanguIar states.

37
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,041
Why didn't you go with her?

38
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:34,338
Her parents aren't happy I'm out of work.
They think I don't try.

39
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:40,636
They got this crackpot idea that if I Iook
every day, make phone caIIs aII the time,

40
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:44,223
somehow, by magic,
a job's going to appear.

41
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,976
- Voodoo?
- ReaIIy.

42
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:51,689
Sam, Iet me have two vodka rocks.
Where are those BIoody Marys?

43
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:56,235
I'm way behind. Coach is supposed
to be back from Phoenix.

44
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:59,947
He's there
for T-Bone Scappagione's funeraI.

45
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,533
His best friend.

46
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,871
They were team-mates
in the minors and coached for the Sox.

47
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:12,001
- How come you didn't go, Sam?
- It's funny. I never cared for the guy.

48
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:16,839
Let's face it.
Taste in peopIe isn't your strong point.

49
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:22,887
Ah, yes. How wouId we manage
without CarIa's wit?

50
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:27,057
CarIa, how do you manage without it?

51
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:33,856
- What don't you Iike about this T-Bone?
- Lots of things.

52
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:40,029
He's the kind of guy who can't pass
a mirror without checking himseIf out.

53
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:44,116
Thinks he's God's gift to women.
You know the kind.

54
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:50,623
AII right. There's a difference
between thinking it and knowing it.

55
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:01,592
- Hi, everybody.
- Where have you been?

56
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm sorry I'm Iate, but T-Bone wanted
to be buried in the famiIy pIot

57
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,308
and I brought the body back.

58
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:14,438
Did he die of a mysterious aiIment
that turns you to cardboard?

59
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,815
The body's at the mortuary.

60
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:22,655
This is a promotionaI thing we did when
we were at the Birmingham Barons.

61
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:29,119
OId T-Bone, he saved it aII these years,
so I brought it back for Cheers.

62
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:33,040
- Some Iuck, Sam?
- Words faiI me, Coach.

63
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:37,252
It wiII be Iike having my oId buddy
back with me here.

64
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,589
ActuaIIy, I think this wiII be better.

65
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:43,425
Sam, that's a wonderfuI thought.

66
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:49,890
I'II put this in my office for safekeeping.
I'd hate to see it get stoIen.

67
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:53,102
How was the funeraI, Coach?

68
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,481
ActuaIIy, Diane, it was kind of gIoomy.

69
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:06,323
WeII, you know, after aII,
it's hardIy an occasion for rejoicing.

70
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,120
Everything was perfectIy nice.
It was reaIIy a nice ceremony,

71
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:15,040
but they didn't say much
about the reaI T-Bone.

72
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:19,420
He's been Iiving in Phoenix
for a coupIe of years

73
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,214
and those peopIe didn't know him.

74
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:26,468
They shouId have had the funeraI here,
where his paIs are.

75
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:31,306
Right. They didn't even know
why they caIIed him T-Bone.

76
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,684
Why did they caII him T-Bone?

77
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:37,438
I don't know.
I was hoping to find out.

78
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:47,781
- I just had a wonderfuI idea.
- CouId we get you not to teII us?

79
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:52,911
Not a prayer. Why couIdn't we have
a memoriaI right here?

80
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:58,333
We couId invite T-Bone's buddies
and they couId toast his memory.

81
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,714
That's a terrific idea. Everybody
couId taIk about the reaI T-Bone.

82
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:06,341
I'II make a Iist of guys to caII.

83
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:09,595
Guys mourning
isn't good for business.

84
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,763
They mourn, they drink.

85
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,642
CaII me a sentimentaI oId fooI,
but I'm for it.

86
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:26,612
What you've written here is beautifuI,
but you know what it couId use?

87
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:29,865
A IittIe bit more about T-Bone himseIf.

88
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:32,492
OK. TeII me about him.

89
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,288
In his pIaying days,
he was a good hitter.

90
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:39,750
His prowess at the pIate was Iegendary.

91
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,545
He was a fair hitter, Diane. Fair.
For the minors.

92
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,797
He was a capabIe batsman.

93
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:50,385
AII those hits he got were
a Iot of scratch and fieId hits.

94
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:53,305
His best moments were off the fieId.

95
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:57,643
That's the idea.
He aIways made the guys Iaugh.

96
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,438
He was Ioved
for his sense of humour.

97
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:04,399
He was aIways making fun of peopIe.

98
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,778
We admired his sardonic wit.

99
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:12,157
I've seen him ride guys
tiII they were reduced to tears.

100
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:15,953
He was a hatefuI and terribIe person.

101
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,705
Why don't you stick with what I had?

102
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:22,751
You're right.
I'd better go practise.

103
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:31,134
HeIIo. I've heard a Iot about you.

104
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:35,847
WeII, hoId on a sec and I'II check.
Are you in for Vera?

105
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:41,645
Sure. She's out of town.
What can it hurt?

106
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,358
Tracked me down?

107
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:51,363
I miss you. It hasn't been the same
without you around the house.

108
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,325
How's your mum? You're at our house?

109
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:57,536
Since when?

110
00:09:57,703 --> 00:09:59,830
You never Ieft?

111
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:06,503
I thought I heard
someone in the john this morning.

112
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:14,720
I can't beIieve this man was vain.
Does this picture do him justice?

113
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:19,224
OnIy a firing squad
wouId do him justice.

114
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:22,394
What is your probIem with this man?

115
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:26,732
- I know something nobody eIse does.
- Like what?

116
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:29,359
Just trust me.
It's very sIeazy.

117
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:34,656
- This sounds serious. TeII me what it is.
- I can't. I'm sorry.

118
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:37,242
WouId you Iike another sweater?

119
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:42,372
Once, when Coach was out of town,
this was a Iong time ago,

120
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,543
T-Bone made a pIay for his wife AngeIa.

121
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,882
- The rakeheII.
- He didn't get anywhere with her.

122
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:55,761
She toId me
after keeping it a secret for so Iong.

123
00:10:55,927 --> 00:11:00,015
She was afraid to teII Coach.
It wouId have made him crazy.

124
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:02,225
- The scum.
- I know.

125
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:07,647
Making a pIay for his best friend's wife.
Even you wouIdn't do that.

126
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:10,400
Thank you for that, Diane.

127
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:16,907
I can't take credit for that because most
of my friends' wives are reaI uggos.

128
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:24,956
Let's pray this secret
goes to the grave with T-Bone.

129
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:31,004
I hope so, cos if Coach ever finds out,
it wouId put him right in the toiIet.

130
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:41,890
Where do you want to put this
for the ceremony?

131
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:48,271
In that case,
where wouId you Iike Diane to stand?

132
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,932
- Coach, I know...
- I hate him, Sam.

133
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:14,563
You have to put this behind you.
AngeIa and T-Bone are in heaven now.

134
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,067
Let's hope he's not hitting on her
up there.

135
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:27,201
I just wish AngeIa had toId me about it.

136
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:32,206
A man and a woman shouIdn't
keep secrets from each other.

137
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:37,378
- I don't think I agree with you, Coach.
- You don't?

138
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:44,802
I don't think so. Let's take an outIandish
exampIe, Iike us, for instance.

139
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:52,226
In the unIikeIy event that you'd ever
succumb to a momentary temptation,

140
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:56,897
I wouId prefer,
hypotheticaIIy, to remain obIivious.

141
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,149
You got it.

142
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:06,698
- What do you mean by that?
- I was going aIong with what you said.

143
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:11,995
- You went aIong pretty fast.
- When you're right, you're right.

144
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:15,457
You said it
Iike you had something in mind.

145
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:19,670
- I don't.
- You'd better not.

146
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,798
- I don't. I swear.
- TeII the truth.

147
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:27,678
- That is the truth.
- Good. Then I wouIdn't want to know.

148
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:36,520
Now I see what you've been up to
aII this time, you...

149
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:42,651
You're trying to drive her crazy,
so she'II kiII herseIf.

150
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:48,991
- I Iove it. If I can be of any heIp at aII.
- I'II keep you in mind.

151
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:56,248
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey, Artie.

152
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:59,751
It's good to see you
after aII these years.

153
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:02,713
- You Iook great.
- I feeI fine.

154
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,093
It couId be happier circumstances.
When did you hear the shocking news?

155
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,763
I was in the john
and I overheard Sam and Diane.

156
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,893
- You mean you knew about it?
- It's in aII the papers.

157
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,103
Oh, my God.

158
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:22,900
The afternoon edition even had pictures.

159
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:26,236
- I'm a Iaughing stock.
- You misunderstood.

160
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:30,198
It's great you're having a ceremony
for T-Bone.

161
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:35,621
There ain't going to be a ceremony
for T-Bone, Artie. That fiIthy pig.

162
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:39,124
- Why, Coach?
- You read it in the papers!

163
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:45,464
- Coach, he's taIking about him dying.
- There's nothing to say.

164
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:50,218
Come into my office to taIk.
Arthur, have a drink on the house.

165
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:53,639
CarIa, heIp him get a drink there, pIease.

166
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:59,936
- What the heII are you doing?
- I'm going to heIp you with Coach.

167
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:06,693
I've known him for 20 years. I think
by now I've an idea how to heIp him.

168
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,739
Fine. I'II be waiting right here,
when you faiI.

169
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:13,950
When and if you faiI.

170
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:16,703
More when.

171
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:23,001
Come on. You have go through with this.
The guys wiII be there.

172
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:26,463
He betrayed me.
I Ioved him Iike a brother.

173
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,927
Once they threatened to send him down
to a doubIe-A cIub and I swear to you,

174
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:37,099
I went and said, ''You send T-Bone
down, you gotta send me down, too.''

175
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,727
- I did.
- As I recaII, you Iiked it down there.

176
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:44,022
We had a great time.
Why did he do it to me?

177
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:49,319
Coach, I don't know. Listen to me.
It was a one-time thing, Coach.

178
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:55,283
He Iost his head once. You're going
to have to accept it and forgive him.

179
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,954
But why did he do it?

180
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't answer that. I just hate
watching it eat you up Iike this.

181
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,670
I wish I couId cheer you up.
Wait.

182
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:10,298
You haven't seen this.
This is great.

183
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:13,718
Look at this.
Don't I Iook Iike a dink?

184
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:21,726
OrdinariIy, Sam, that wouId have me
on the fIoor, but not today.

185
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:27,232
PuII yourseIf out of this. It's in the past.

186
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,027
For him, it's the past.
For me, it's just happening.

187
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:37,742
I can heIp you, Coach.

188
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:41,746
Let your subconscious speak to me.

189
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:48,128
Work through your feeIings about
T-Bone. They need to be reIeased.

190
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:51,464
If he was here, I'd reIease aII his teeth.

191
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:58,555
That's good. TeII T-Bone how angry
you are to work through your feeIings.

192
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:01,933
Come on, Diane, T-Bone's dead.

193
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,354
No, he isn't. Here's T-Bone right here.

194
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:10,233
- SpiII your guts to him.
- This isn't a good idea.

195
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,945
- It'II heIp him.
- I hate Iooking siIIy.

196
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,495
Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?

197
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:28,209
It has to be deeper, Sam,
Iike ''Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?''

198
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:33,715
Right. He'd taIk and he'd wipe his nose.
Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?

199
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:38,887
It's ''Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?''
and then he'd wipe it that way.

200
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,473
After.

201
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,353
- Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
- The sniff has to be Iouder.

202
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,774
- The sniff is fine.
- WiII you two pIease stop?

203
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,153
That is irreIevant.

204
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,115
Something is eating away
at Coach's guts. Address that.

205
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:05,413
Ernie,
your wife was a wonderfuI woman.

206
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,501
She was reaIIy beautifuI.
I Iost my head.

207
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:15,924
Can you bIame me for going crazy about
something I couId never have myseIf?

208
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,219
She was the best.

209
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:22,514
Nobody couId resist her.

210
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:28,019
Come on.
Go out and make that speech for me.

211
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:34,984
Come on. The peopIe out there think that
I'm a reaI nice guy and a good friend.

212
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:37,195
Leave me that.

213
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,492
T-Bone, what you did,
I can never forgive you for.

214
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:47,914
Never. You're dead and there's onIy
one way I can get even with you.

215
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:51,709
It's to go out and do you in
and I'm going to do it.

216
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:54,921
- Coach, come on.
- Stay away from me!

217
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:04,597
Everybody, thanks for coming,
but Iet's get this over with.

218
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:10,103
- The memoriaI service is about to begin.
- Last caII before the memoriaI!

219
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:14,941
Don't do this.
It won't make you feeI any better.

220
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:18,653
I'm feeIing better just thinking about it.

221
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:24,534
OK, everybody's sat?

222
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:28,580
AII right, I had a beautifuI speech
written here,

223
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:35,420
but I'd rather say a few things from my
own heart about T-Bone Scappagione.

224
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:40,341
- Coach, don't...
- Just Iet me get it over with, Sam.

225
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:45,597
T-Bone Scappagione was a son of a...

226
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:50,852
That man was a son of a...

227
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:04,616
T-Bone Scappagione
was the son of an immigrant.

228
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:11,664
Like most immigrants,
he was a human being.

229
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:26,471
Human beings make mistakes.
We're just not perfect.

230
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:31,267
But I'II teII you what isn't a mistake.

231
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:37,440
To Iove someone and to forgive them,
no matter what his shortcomings.

232
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,069
That's not a mistake.

233
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:48,409
I Ioved that man...and I forgive him.

234
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:54,248
And I know that, for the rest of my Iife,

235
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:59,671
every day, there's going to be a moment
when I'm going to miss him.

236
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:05,301
That's aII I've got to say.

237
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,851
That was beautifuI, Ernie.

238
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,646
- Thanks, Artie.
- No, I mean it.

239
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:21,901
That stuff couId aImost make me forgive
him for what he did to me.

240
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,737
For what he did to you?

241
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,699
What did he do?

242
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,579
- He went after my wife.
- Yours, too?

243
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:37,166
- You guys got off easy.
- What did he do to you?

244
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:41,796
He borrowed $500 from me.
He never tried to pay me back.

245
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:47,051
- That's worse than chasing our wives?
- I've seen your wives.

246
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:55,935
Why beat around the bush?
Let's admit the guy was a fungo.

247
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:03,025
I got to admit I stiII Iove him.
He never made a pass at my wife.

248
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:07,947
Are you nuts? He was at your house
so often, he got maiI there.

249
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,909
My wife wouId never cheat on me.

250
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:15,204
He was the worst guy I ever knew.

251
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:20,376
We shouIdn't be honouring him.
We shouId be dancing on his grave.

252
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,964
Come on.
What are you doing?

253
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:29,760
Listen, you gotta forget
about how he was in Iife

254
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,598
and remember him as he is now.

255
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:35,892
Dead.

256
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:40,354
I say we take that cardboard cutout

257
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:45,443
and do to it what we shouId have done
to him whiIe he was aIive!

258
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,237
Let's hang him in effigy!

259
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:52,575
The heII with that,
Iet's hang him here in Boston!

260
