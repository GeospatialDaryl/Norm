          Hey, Sam.

the timing is perfect.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
I waited long enough for her

Well, I have to give up lunches.

what makes you think that       
I was gonna ask you for a date?

You must really think      
     you look hot tonight.

Then why did you come in here?

64

Well, I was, uh...

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,900
gonna compliment you      
        on your blouse.

66

That's a very pretty blouse.

Well, we haven't seen each
      other today until now.

How did you know I'd
            be wearing this one?

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,100
I was hoping          
    you were gonna wear it.

70
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,100
It's always been        
      my favorite blouse.

71
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,200
It's brand-new; it's      
  the first time I've worn it.

I was in the store        
      when you bought it.

74
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,700
I bought it mail order.

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,100
I drove the truck               
that delivered it to your house.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
One date-- come on, please?

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
What, is this gonna kill you?

Nothing but users, and takers,

and big, stupid jerks,          
who don't even know you exist

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,400
and then go running off to Japan
    with someone else.

82
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,600
That is such a cliché.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400

Forget it.

I happen to think I
             have a real future 
             with this company.

86
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,300
No offense, but... why?

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Because I think it's my time.

88
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,300
You know, Evan took a lot       
of key people with him to Japan.

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
And the way I figure it,

90
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,300
everyone who knows    
          I'm a washout is gone.

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
Ooh.

92
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Talk about sitting pretty.

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
You bet.

94
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
You know, the new executive
     vice president, Mr. Stone

95

          a little housecleaning

at the corporate level.

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
From where I am,

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,800
it could be just a     
         short climb to the top.

99
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
Yeah, speaking of climbing

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,000
to the top,                     
the way I see it,

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,700
you haven't had a date          
with a guy

102
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,900
for about two and half years.

103
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,500
Now, I think this date of ours  
could be good for me,

104
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,600
but, sweetheart, I got to say,

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,700
it's looking real necessary     
for you.

106
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,800
Sam, no.

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,300
We're starting to   
            become good friends.

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
Now, why wreck that?
Why not...

think they ought to go out with,

110
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,300
and as a friend,                
I'm telling you,

111
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,900
you ought to give               
this Malone guy a chance.

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,200

116

That is great.

reference here,

120

uh, what did I do right         
this time?

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just that         
     since Evan went away,

122
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,200
my expectations are low.

123
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,400
And with my stove on the blink 
and nothing on the tube tonight,

124

                    I'll be     
                    right there.

Ah, look at that.

That really takes me back,

        the wine.

Sounds pretty romantic, Norm.

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Yeah, it was.

163
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,700
You know, in retrospect,

 <i>her</i> something, but, uh...

brought these in

170
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,200

171
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,600
( <i>chuckles</i> ):  
                 Thank you, Sam.

172
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Ah. Shall we go?

173
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
It's just dinner.

174
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,200
Yeah, dinner,          
    right, absolutely.

175

It's him, Greg Stone,

179
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,200
the new exec VP.

180
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,600
I saw his picture in   
         the company newsletter.

Mr. Stone!

182

Welcome, welcome.

183
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,100
It's such an honor              
to have you here.

184
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,600
Mr. Stone,                      
I'd like you to meet

185
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,600
Sam Malone.
Yeah, hi.

186
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Pleased to meet you, Sam.

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

188
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Who are you?

189

Rebecca Howe.

190
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,100
I'm the manager.

191
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,400
Ah, of course.

192
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,800
I'd like to use your
            phone if I may.

193
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,100
You can do anything    
         you want with my phone.

194
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
Thank you...   
                 For the moment,

195
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,600
I thought I'd just
              speak into it.

196
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,800
Good choice.

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,500
Okay, come on.                  
Let's go.

198
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Sweetheart,                     
we're gonna be late. Let's...

199
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,600
He could very well be

200
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,000
the most handsome man      
    I have ever seen.

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
( <i>patrons groaning</i> )

202
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,600
And did you see the way
         he looked in my eyes

203
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
when he said, 
                  "Who are you?"

204
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
I think he      
                really likes me.

205
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,100
We all do, honey.

206
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,300
Now, let's go.

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,700
No, Sam, you don't
              understand.

208
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,700
He's the man I've been
          giving my accounts to 
          the last couple weeks.

209
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,600
I think he could be    
         my ticket to corporate.

210
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
( <i>door opens</i> )

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Miss Howe, I'd like to see you 
          in my office

212
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,900
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

213
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,100
Mm-hmm.

214
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,500
What'd I tell you?  
            What did I tell you?
Yeah, that's great.

215
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
Now, let's go celebrate,        
all right?

216
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Oh, excuse me, 
                 excuse me, sir!

217
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Listen, as long as you were
     gonna tell me anyway,

218
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
why don't you just go 
          ahead and tell me now?

219
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
This is not the time            
or the place.

220
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,100
Oh, please tell me.

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
You've been going   
            over my files?

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, I have.

223
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,000
And we're doing better?

224
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,400
Yes, we're doing better.

225
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Well, then what's   
            the problem?

226
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Just go ahead and tell me.

227
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,100
I really think we should        
discuss this privately.

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,100
Pal, just between   
            us guys here,

229
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
do me a favor and tell her.

230
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,200
It'd kind of help               
grease the old skids.

231
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,900
I really don't think.      
         Sir, excuse me, please?

232
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,000
Please?

233
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,600
Very well, Ms. Howe,  
             if you insist.

234
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,900
This, uh, quarter has shown   
     a slight improvement.

235
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Did you hear that,
              everybody?

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
"A slight improvement."

237
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,400
STONE:                          
But the records show,

238
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
unequivocally,         
    that the bar did better

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
under Sam's direction      
          than yours.

240
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,000
In view of this,

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm hereby appointing Sam       
        the new manager.

242
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,400
And I regret to say

243
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
I'm forced to give you notice.

244
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,700
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,300
Okay, boys, dessert.

246
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,500
Well, what do you say we go     
strap on the ol' feedbag, huh?

00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,900
You coming?

Uh...

you guys want to help me
        get her into the car?

250
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,300
I'll get the door.

251
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,800
This is gonna be a lot easier   
than I thought.

I don't know, Carla.

253
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Either managing a bar is getting

254
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,700
a lot more complicated,

255
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,500
or I'm getting a lot dumber.

256
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,000
You couldn't be getting
         any dumber, Sam.

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Well, it must be                
that other thing.

You know, having  
              you back in charge

259
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
really reminds me of
            old times, you know?

260
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,400
I mean, real old times.

261
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,100
Even before the evil days,

262
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,700
when darkness          
      fell over the earth.

        Diane was still here.

what she means.

Rebecca, I...   
    Sam, please.

309
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
It'll make it a lot easier.

310
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,300
You know,

311
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,300
I might just become a bag lady.

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,700
They're not all old, you know.

313
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,600
It could happen.

314
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,300
It really could.

315
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,200
I'll just send

316
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,000
for the rest of my things.

317
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,400
No, Rebecca,
                    wait a sec.

318
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Honey, listen.

319
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,200
Sam, Stone                      
is still on hold.

320
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,900
He needs those figures
          on the double.

321
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:49,600
( <i>groaning</i> )

322
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,900
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

323
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,800
Well, what the hell is that?

324
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm no computer expert,         
but it looks like Donkey Kong.

325
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,500
Oh, man, that,
                  that stinks.

326
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,700
You know, I, I...

327
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
It's not like it used to
        be around here, Carla.

328
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,800
I mean corporations,
            computers, reports.

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
I mean, I used to keep
          track of inventory

330
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,100
in a spiral notebook,           
for God's sake.

331
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,300
No, you didn't.

332
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,800
Well, I always meant to.

333
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,600
You know, I-I just      
        hate being in charge.

334
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm not good at it.

335
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,300
Rebecca wasn't good at it       
            either,

336
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,900
but at least she enjoyed it.

337
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,700
You know,               
 I'm going to go back to Stone,

338
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,200
and I'm going to beg him        
to give her this job back.

339
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,600
No, wait a minute.

340
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,000
You're quitting         
        because of this machine?

341
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,900
Carla, I hate that machine.

342
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,400
John Henry hated a machine, too.

343
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,500
Do you know the story      
      of John Henry, Sam?

344
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,800
He went toe to toe with a   
    steel-driving machine,

345
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,700
and he refused to admit

346
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,400
that that machine           
      was better than him.

347
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,700
And do you know what happened?

348
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah, the machine               
beat him.

349
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,200
His heart exploded;             
he died.

350
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,100
He did?

351
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Yes.

352
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,600
Well, go get her job back   
    before you lose your ticker.

353
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,200
Go on.

354
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,600
Whoa, how'd it go?

355
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, Woody, Woody, give me       
a seltzer there, will you?

356
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,100
Mr. Stone is dead set   
        against rehiring her,

357
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,400
and I hate to beg       
        when sex isn't involved.

358
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
So, what happened?

359
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,600
Well, I had to promise
          that she'd agree

360
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
to a whole list
                 of conditions,

361
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,900
but he finally said yes.

362
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,200
I left a message

363
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,400
on her answering machine        
that I wanted to talk to her.

364
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
What are you      
              going to tell her?

365
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm going to tell her           
to take her stupid job back.

366
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
I don't want it anymore.

367
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
Wait a minute, Sam.
             Aren't you missing 
             something here?

368
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
What?

369
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,400
You desperately want to jump
    this woman's bones, right?

370
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,900
Sure.

371
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,400
And you've just arranged
        something for her

372
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,900
that she wants more than   
     anything else in the world.

373
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
So?

374
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Don't you see a connection
      between those two things?

375
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,400
Breaks your heart,
              doesn't it?

376
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,900
You tell Rebecca  
              that you loved    
              being the manager,

377
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,500
but you couldn't   
             stand to see her   
             being so miserable,

378
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
so you got her
                  her job back.

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Next thing you know,

380
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,700
she'll be doing     
            the backstroke on   
            your water bed.

381
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Carla, I'm shocked.

382
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,400
Why, 'cause you didn't
          think of it first?

383
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah. I mean,                   
I must be losing it.

384
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,400
Woody, uh,

385
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,500
call Melville's.

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Tell them I want an 8:00        
reservation for two.

387
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, and tell them               
that I want

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,600
booth number five,              
chill their best champagne,

389
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,900
yeah, and order                 
a chocolate soufflé for dessert.

390
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Aw, gee, Sam, that sounds good,

391
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,100
but actually,          
      I brought my dinner.

392
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,700
Woody...                        
make the reservation.

393
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,100
All right, but this is a waste

394
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,500
of a perfectly good       
      meatball sandwich.

395
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
Thank you.

396
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,200
Sam, I can't thank you enough   
for getting my job back.

397
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,700
I finally feel good             
about myself again.

398
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,000
You know, the first thing I did 
when I got home

399
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,100
was I-I put in an order         
for that Mercedes.

400
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,600
Ah, well, I think   
            you'll look great

401
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,300
wearing one of those.

402
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,900
So...

403
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you having a good time?

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Yeah, I actually am.

405
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,300
Well, you don't have to sound  
         so surprised.

406
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh, I'm sorry;         
  I didn't mean it like that.

407
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,000
( <i>sighing</i> ):          
    It's just that...

408
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,400
with all your obnoxious     
come-ons, and everything,

409
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,600
I never expected you to be as...

410
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,600
as charming           
    as you've been tonight.

411
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,500
No kidding.

412
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,800
So, what do you find
            charming about me?

413
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Well, for one thing,      
    I find it charming

414
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,600
that you would try to impress me
by ordering an elegant soufflé,

415
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,100
when I know perfectly well      
that your favorite dessert

416
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,800
is frozen Snicker bars.

417
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Actually, they're   
            in the bottom

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,700
of your champagne   
            bucket there.

419
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,100
( <i>chuckling</i> )

420
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh, I think I was  
             just charming again
             there, wasn't I?

421
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't get it.

422
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,300
Just when I thought       
    I had you pegged,

423
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,500
you go out and do something   
      like you did today.

424
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
Sam,

425
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that really was the nicest thing

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
that anyone           
     has ever done for me.

427
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,300
Well, you deserve to have   
    nice things done for you.

428
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
You're a very nice person.

429
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,400
So are you.

430
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
Sam?

431
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah?

432
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,700
Is that your hand on my leg?

433
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,400
Oh, I'll be darned.

434
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,200
My left hand does seem to   
    be missing, doesn't it?

435
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,100
Do you want me to move it?

436
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Yes.

437
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,600
That's not what I meant.

438
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Oh, thank you, God.

439
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Ah! Mr. Stone! Hi!

440
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,900
What a surprise!

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Oh, good evening.

442
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,300
I wonder if we      
            could have the      
            table over there?

443
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,400
Mr. Stone,                      
I'm not the hostess.

444
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm Rebecca Howe,               
from downstairs.

445
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,800
Ah, yeah, of   
                 course you are.

446
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,300
Miss Howe.

447
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,900
I guess I ought to
              say welcome back.

448
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,400
I was a little surprised
        you agreed to the       
        conditions, but if you

449
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
can live with   
                them, so can we.

450
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,000
Ah, here's    
                  the maitre d'.

451
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,100
I wonder if I could
             have that table    
             in the other room?

452
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Nice to see
                     you again.

453
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,100
What was he                     
talking about?

454
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,800
What conditions?

455
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,700
You want some  
                 more champagne?

456
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,900
Sam, what conditions?

457
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,500
Well, they were         
    so insignificant,

458
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,900
they really     
                slipped my mind.

459
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,600
Uh, all right, uh.

460
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,900
Well, uh...

461
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,700
You have to take   
             a... slight pay cut

462
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,000
and go back to school   
        for your MBA

463
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,900
and share the  
                 office with me,

464
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,800
consult with me on  
            all major decisions,

465
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
and since you lack any
          practical experience,

466
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
you'll have to  
                wait tables when
                the bar is busy,

467
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,000
which will put you      
        under the immediate     
        supervision of Carla.

468
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,700
Any wonder it   
                slipped my mind?

469
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,100
Sam, uh, when were you planning 
      on telling me this?

470
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,500
After.

471
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,500
After what?

472
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Afterwards.

473
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
All right, um.

474
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm sorry, I should     
        have told you, but...

475
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I just thought that     
        you'd been going through
        such a tough time

476
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,000
that you deserved 
              at least one night

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,100
of feeling good
                 about yourself.

478
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,400
All right, I'll
                 call you a cab.

479
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,500
No, no, no.

480
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
It's okay.

481
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
The important thing       
  is that I have my job back.

482
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,000
You're not upset
                about this?

483
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,800
No, how can I be upset

484
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,600
when I have so much       
      to be thankful for?

485
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,900
Now... where were we?

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Does this look familiar?

487
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,800
Sam?                  
                  Yeah?

488
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,700
I want tonight                  
to be very special.

489
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
Mmm.

490
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,800
And I think I can figure        
a way out for us to do that.

491
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,500
You see, I have this fantasy...

492
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,000
and it's something              
that I've always wanted to try,

493
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,600
but I didn't ever think         
that I'd get to do it

494
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,500
until tonight.

495
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,400
Would you like to know          
what it is?

496
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Yes, please.

497
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,100
Okay.

498
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,400
Well, you see,                  
I have this hot tub at home.

499
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,700
I love the way this begins.

500
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
And what we do                  
when we get there...

501
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,300
First?

502
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Uh-huh.

503
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,600
And then...

504
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
Oh, God.

505
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,200
Oh, please.

506
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,700
A-a-a-and this is the part

507
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,500
that's just                     
a little tiny bit illegal.

508
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
No, no, no, no, no.

509
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh, I don't think               
that I should tell you.

510
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,500
I really think it would     
be better if I showed you.

511
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,100
Come with me now,               
so we don't spoil the mood.

512
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Could you just give me a minute?

513
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,700
No.

514
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Bye-bye, Sam.

515
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,800
Can I get you anything
          else, Mr. Malone?

516
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
No, thank you, Paul.

517
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,900
Actually, Paul,

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,500
could I have another one    
  of your chocolate soufflés?

519
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,900
Are you aware          
that will take 45 minutes?

520
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes, Paul, I am.

521
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,500
Woody,

522
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,900
Sam's going                     
to be upstairs for a while.

523
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,700
When he comes down,             
give him this message.

524
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,300
You tell him that it will be    
a cold day in hell

525
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,100
before I ever share an office   
with him,

526
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,500
or schlep drinks                
in a two-bit saloon.

527
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh, Miss Howe?

528
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,500
By the way, Midtown
             Mercedes called,

529
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,100
and they said you can       
    pick up your car anytime.

530
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,700
Oh, and they got the one        
you wanted-- the red one.

531
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,300
The red one?

532
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Hi, there.

533
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
My name's Rebecca...

534
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,700
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):       
and it will be my pleasure      
         to serve you.
