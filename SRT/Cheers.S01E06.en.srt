1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,714
- Answer that for me, will you?
- You bet, Coach.

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,116
Cheers.
Carla? Yeah. Carla, it's for you.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,834
- Sounds like trouble with the kids.
- l'm not here.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,273
- Carla.
- Give it to me. What is it?

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,634
Seraphina's where?

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,193
Well, cut her down.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,633
No, l don't care if it helps
the TV reception. Cut her down.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,751
And if l get home and you've flushed
the car keys again, you've had it.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,634
By the way, any more problems tonight
and you're adopted.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,271
Your real mother
is Doris Slobotkin, 555 8921 .

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,434
Think that's gonna work?

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,835
One-in-a-million chance
but l gotta take it.

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,917
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,670
Sounds like you had
a pretty nice day off.

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,076
Well, it was so nice l don't know
if l'm ready to talk about it yet.

16
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,916
However, if you insist.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,390
l went out with David
from the Anthropology Department.

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,476
He took me up to New Hampshire.

19
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,359
We walked in the woods,
we communed with nature.

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,119
We stayed in a little inn
where John Adams slept.

21
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,073
Yeah, lots of guys
sign the register that way.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,068
Well,
now l know why l didn't wanna talk.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,511
l had a pretty nice day off myself.

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,710
Taffy and l went sailing
up at Marble Head.

25
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,270
Taffy?

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,753
Sailing?

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,155
You?

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,993
You got a problem with that?

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,553
No. lt's just thought your idea of
romance was brunch and a cockfight.

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,239
l love sailing.

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,830
After seeing <i>Ordinary People</i>,
l've tried to get my kids interested.

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,829
- Afternoon everybody.
- Ho, Norm.

33
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,359
How's life treating you?

34
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,357
Like he caught in bed with his wife.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,671
- How about a beer?
- Yowza!

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,277
l gonna bring some company in.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,834
- Who are you bringing in?
- My new superior.

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,637
l gotta butter him up a little bit.

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,593
Bring him in here for a drink,
catch some dinner upstairs.

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,871
- Why not take him to your house?
- My wife lives there.

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,514
Gotcha.

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,039
One things, you guys,
you don't know me in here, OK?

43
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,309
Why?

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,715
l don't want him to think
l'm a bar fly.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,274
- Good.
- Don't call me Norm.

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,435
Gotcha, Norm.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,118
Diane, would you get some singles
up at Melville's, please.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,639
Aye, aye, skipper.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,914
Coach, l'll be right back.
l'm gonna get some wine.

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,478
- Pardon me.
- Hi.

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,318
l'm looking for a Diane Chambers.

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,510
You're in luck. We've got one.

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,598
- l beg your pardon?
- l hope you only want one.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,193
Do you sense this conversation
is an exercise in futility?

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,190
Thank you. My name is Ernie Pantusso
but you can call me Coach.

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,390
- Rebecca Prout.
- Hi, Becky.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
Diane and l shared a suite
at Bennington.

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,079
No kidding? Sam and l
shared a Chunky Bar in Cleveland.

59
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,512
- Where is Diane Chambers?
- Upstairs. She'll be a minute.

60
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,313
Well,
l'll just sit at a table and wait.

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,793
Okey-dokey.

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,388
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome. Any time.

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,828
- Rebecca.
- Diane.

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,232
What a wonderful coincidence.

65
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,316
l never come into a place like this.

66
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,398
l'm doing research for a paper...

67
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,555
What the hell's going on here?

68
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,153
A serving girl.

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,478
Would you bring us a bottle of wine?

70
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,950
Only if l can spit in it.

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,278
lt's all right.
l know that you work here.

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,393
- Alright, how did you find out?
- l called your mother.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,353
She took her head out of the oven
long enough to fill me in.

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,356
God, l've missed you.

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,791
l'll never forget
those long afternoons in the quad,

76
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,230
drinking champagne, eating brioche
with strawberry preserves.

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,318
Reading and talking Schopenhauer.

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,193
Well, enough Schope-talk.

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,993
That's the beauty
about being a mailman.

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,556
l don't have to play smoochy-woochy
with my superiors the way you do.

81
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,832
Cliff, believe me, it's worth it
for accounting. l love numbers.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,518
God help me, l love them.

83
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,469
Me, l like the challenges.

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,593
Dogs, vicious kids,
those hard-to-find mailboxes.

85
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,711
You think accounting's boring?

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,115
l miss one digit,
a company goes in the toilet.

87
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,394
l'll tell you when it all makes
sense. Mother's Day.

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,829
Delivering a card to some old hag.

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,433
Watching her eyes mist up,...

90
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,549
..kinda gets me
right behind the old ballpoint.

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,232
You want to talk sentimental?
Take that same old crone.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,874
Save her a couple of hundred bucks
on the short form.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,991
Then l know
why the Big Guy put me here.

94
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,677
l actually get paid to stand here
and listen to great conversation.

95
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,752
Rebecca, there's something wrong.

96
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,031
You could always see
through my faÃ§ade of gaiety.

97
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,397
Elliot and l have parted.

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,519
Rebecca, no. You and Elliot?

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,915
You were together for ever.

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,639
l know. lt all began when Elliot got
his doctorate in lchthyology.

101
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,113
His eye began to wander.

102
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,597
The first thing l knew, he'd taken up
with a student on a squid expedition.

103
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,429
A doctorate changes a man.

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,516
But there'll be others, right?

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,835
ln the meantime,
you still have your work.

106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,678
You'd think so.

107
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,712
l used to find enormous comfort
translating Russian poetry.

108
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,115
- l know.
- But no more.

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,435
Even when l went back
over my favourite,

110
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,553
Karashnikov's <i>Another Christmas</i>
<i>of Agony</i>, it failed to soothe me.

111
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,313
''Mischa the dog lies dead in the bog,

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,234
The children cry over the carcass,

113
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,870
The mist chokes my heart,
Covers the mourners,

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,230
At least this year we eat.''

115
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,200
lf that didn't pick you up,
l'm at a virtual loss.

116
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,391
What l need is to blot out
Elliot's memory.

117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,351
That's exactly what you should do.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,710
l'm looking for a man.

119
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,188
Pardon?

120
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,675
Diane, l've been thinking about this
carefully.

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,872
l think what l need is something
l've never had before.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,594
An evening
of unbridled bestial pleasure.

123
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,554
l want to burn
at the stake of passion.

124
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,070
Rebecca, you're very vulnerable now.
Please, don't do anything foolish.

125
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,273
l've never done anything foolish
in my life and it's high time l did.

126
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,110
The man l'm looking for
should be peasant stock.

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,396
Tall, dark, strong, hairy arms.

128
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,836
But most important, he should be
unintellectual. One-word sentences.

129
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,030
- Do you know anyone like that?
- No.

130
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,230
Diane, did you get the small bills?

131
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,916
Yeah. Right. Excuse me. Here you go.

132
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,077
l need a ten in silver.
Would you get it for more, please?

133
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,714
OK, Coach. l'll be right back.

134
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,070
You just sit very still,
sip your wine.

135
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,428
Slowly.

136
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,235
Damn.

137
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,794
- Hi there.
- Hi there.

138
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,913
Come here often?

139
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,756
Just about every day. l work here.

140
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,075
l couldn't help noticing your arms.

141
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,952
Yeah,
l get a lot of comments on these.

142
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,991
They go all the way down to my hands.

143
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,195
- What's your name?
- Sam. Change.

144
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,675
Why? l like myself this way.

145
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,589
Sam. Two bourbons straight.

146
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,390
Diane, it's him. l want him.

147
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,154
Who?
The gay guy with the war wound?

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,679
You can't fool me.
He's exactly what l'm looking for.

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,960
You're not interested in him,
are you?

150
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,269
No, of course not.

151
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,960
Then l'm going for him
before l lose my nerve.

152
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,237
Sam,
that woman is a dear friend of mine.

153
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,079
She is going through
a very difficult period.

154
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,076
So whatever she asks you,
please, just say ''no''.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,351
- What?
- ''No.''

156
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,311
- Diane?
- Yes.

157
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,635
Would you excuse us a moment?

158
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,079
Fine.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,036
Would you object
to joining me in my hotel

160
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,878
for an afternoon of animal passion?

161
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,509
No.

162
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,793
- What's your name?
- Does it matter?

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,875
No.

164
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,830
Diane, Sam's not back yet.

165
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,233
So? Who cares?

166
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,319
l would if he took off with my friend
for two hours.

167
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,510
One hour.

168
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,198
And 53 minutes.

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,475
Sam always did like day games.

170
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,073
What do you say?
This looks a nice place.

171
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,197
What are you gonna have, strangers?

172
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,471
Let me get this, Mr Stabell.

173
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,716
l think l'll have a...

174
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,353
Perrier.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,959
- Give me a beer.
- Wait a minute. A beer?

176
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,548
That sounds a refreshing change.
l'll have a beer.

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,028
Coach. Listen.

178
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,993
- Hold me to one beer tonight.
- One at a time?

179
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,792
For the whole night.

180
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,590
Here we go.

181
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,994
Two tankards of their finest ale.

182
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,873
Let's talk.

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,879
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.

184
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,198
- Diane, Sam's here.
- So?

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,754
l'm gonna be in my office back here.

186
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,593
Well, hey...
Nothing going on here, huh?

187
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,714
Dead.

188
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,953
l think l'm gonna stretch my legs,
get a little exercise, fresh air.

189
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,956
Gotta take it easy.

190
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,878
l have no respect
for a man who can't control himself

191
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,479
when it comes to drinking.

192
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,713
Me neither.

193
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,394
How could you do that
to that poor woman?

194
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,509
Do what?

195
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,790
Do what. Thank you, Mr Quickpants.

196
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,629
Rebecca is a very vulnerable person,
coming off a shattered relationship.

197
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,591
How could you go off with her?

198
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,997
She said, ''Would you mind?''

199
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,754
Would you mind.

200
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,350
Those three words are all that
separate you from a rutting pig.

201
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,038
That and my aftershave.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,833
How dare you try to be funny
when l hate you?

203
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,757
Come on. What's the big deal?
We're all adults, aren't we?

204
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,473
Yes. Contrary to your assumption,
l am not a prude.

205
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,276
l have a healthy attitude toward...

206
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,114
..you know.

207
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,512
Answer me one question.

208
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,756
Are you proud of what you did today?

209
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,518
l don't kiss and tell.

210
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,510
The pig develops scruples.

211
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,718
Come on. Look, l'm just kidding
you. Nothing happened. Alright?

212
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,435
- He compounds it by lying.
- No lie. l swear, nothing happened.

213
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,276
You mean
Rebecca came to her senses?

214
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,433
No. l stopped it.

215
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,073
l get it.

216
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,795
You got angry because she considered
you nothing but a stud service?

217
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,033
No, l like that.

218
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,879
The problem was
that l couldn't shut her up.

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,070
No offence
but your friend is very boring.

220
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,589
She's depressing
and she's long-winded.

221
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,030
Those dismal Russian poems.
They don't even rhyme.

222
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,590
After listening to two hours' worth
of frostbite and famine,

223
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,029
l decided
to get my balalaikas out of there.

224
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,679
You turned a woman down?

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,396
Yeah. Here l am all primed
for a wonderful afternoon...

226
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,031
You can't admit the truth, can you?

227
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,235
What? What is the truth?

228
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,958
Decency finally won out. You did
the right thing. You were noble.

229
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,594
No. l was bored.

230
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,317
Unconsciously, you were sensitive
to her suffering

231
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,079
and you didn't want
to take advantage of that.

232
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,591
- Think so?
- Yes.

233
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,469
Sam Malone, you're a better man
than you're willing to admit.

234
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,271
Maybe you're right. Maybe l am kinda
turning into a sensitive guy.

235
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,557
Maybe l'll never
look at a woman again

236
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,638
and see her as a mere sex object.

237
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,591
No, scratch that thought.

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,116
lt was my favourite audit.

239
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,553
lt nearly cost my marriage,
but it was worth it.

240
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,835
Gotta go for the gusto.

241
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,950
l like your enthusiasm, Norm.
You're a workhorse.

242
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,239
Clydesdale.

243
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,997
You know,
l'm having one heck of a time.

244
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,079
l don't usually do this,
but let's have another.

245
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,508
- Coach, two more beers.
- Can't do it, Norm.

246
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,428
- No. lt's OK now.
- Norm, l'm not letting you down.

247
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,472
- You said one beer.
- All right.

248
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,750
- One beer for my friend.
- That's different.

249
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,438
He'll have a pitcher.

250
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,075
Diane,

251
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,713
l've come to say goodbye.
For ever.

252
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,116
- Rebecca, what's wrong?
- l'm not attractive to men.

253
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,150
What?

254
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,397
First Elliot and now what's-his-name.

255
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,952
Rebecca, l'm sorry.

256
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,153
Do you have to believe
in God to be a nun?

257
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,152
lt helps.

258
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,598
What did Sam do to you?

259
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,076
- Who's Sam?
- The bartender.

260
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,513
Nothing. That's the problem.

261
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,116
Diane, he found me repulsive.

262
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,753
No, Rebecca.
This must be a misunderstanding.

263
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,030
He climbed out the window.

264
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,519
l'm going back there to talk to Sam.
He must know that he's hurt you.

265
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,757
l originally wanted to be a dancer.

266
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,237
You're a pig.

267
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,711
l haven't moved.
How did l get back to pig?

268
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,798
- You have ruined a human being.
- Who?

269
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,319
Rebecca.

270
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,716
- She's sitting out there right now.
- Mother Russia? l'm not here.

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,232
Sam, she's crushed. l have never seen
this woman so depressed.

272
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,316
Believe me,
l have seen her depressed.

273
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,955
- l believe you.
- Well, you have to do something.

274
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,470
She is seriously upset. lt's your
fault for the way you rejected her.

275
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,713
- Wait, where are you going?
- l am going to bring her in.

276
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,597
No. Come on, give me a minute
to build a window, or something.

277
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,789
You're going
to restore her confidence.

278
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,319
What am l gonna say?

279
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,556
Just tell her
the reason you rejected her

280
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,830
wasn't because you found her
unattractive.

281
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,712
What was the reason?

282
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,832
l don't know. Tell her
that you belong to someone else.

283
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,919
That you lost your head for a moment,
that you're an uncaring worm.

284
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,792
l was laughed at by the other boys,
Norm.

285
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,598
Rebecca, may l speak to you in here
for a moment?

286
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,076
But don't they always laugh
at the graceful fellows?

287
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,669
Hello, Rebecca.

288
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,351
Hello... Again.

289
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,399
When l left the hotel, l may have
given you the wrong impression.

290
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,431
You see,
l thought there was a fire.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,797
l'm sorry.

292
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,070
Rebecca, l might not have
been totally fair with you.

293
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,875
The reason l left was,
l'm kinda seeing another person.

294
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,795
l was afraid
this was going to happen.

295
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,354
You're making excuses
to spare my feelings.

296
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,677
No. This is true.
l really am seeing somebody else.

297
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,870
- Please.
- Rebecca.

298
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,958
You are a very desirable woman.

299
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,516
He does happen to be going
with somebody, that's all.

300
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,596
- Me.
- You?

301
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,393
We can tell it now. Yes. Today we had
a tiff right before you came in.

302
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,435
And Sam used you to make me jealous
and then when push came to shove,

303
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,350
he finally remembered what
a wonderful thing we have together.

304
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,471
lsn't that right, sweetheart?

305
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,910
Yeah. Sure. You bet ya.

306
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,754
Yes, Sam and l are deeply
and passionately in love.

307
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,156
l can't believe it. You two?

308
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,590
lt's incredible.
l'd never have put you two together.

309
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,998
Well, l know. lt does test
the limits of human logic.

310
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,233
But, like you, l was growing
bored with bright, articulate men.

311
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,439
- You were?
- Sure.

312
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,074
l was looking for meat and potatoes.

313
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,555
Sam here, the old side of beef,
really fit the bill.

314
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,873
You know, l was getting kinda bored
with beautiful, sexy, sensuous women.

315
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,752
l decided to go for pleasant.

316
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,830
Believe it or not, l actually prefer
a man who's thick and ordinary.

317
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,037
l guess l'm kind of old-fashioned.

318
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,799
l like a woman
who does what her man tells her.

319
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,270
Lookee there, my shoe's undone.
Will you get that for me, honey?

320
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,559
What, darling?

321
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,592
Would you tie
my shoesy-woosy for me?

322
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,556
She loves doing
these little things for me.

323
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,515
That's a little tight there, honey.

324
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,357
- How's that, sweetheart?
- That's much better. Thank you.

325
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,310
Well, all of a sudden,
l feel like l'm intruding.

326
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,191
l can see that
there's such emotion in this room.

327
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,431
Thank you for everything, Diane.

328
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,950
Rebecca, thank you.
lt was wonderful to see you again.

329
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,674
- l'll write you.
- Oh, good. Things'll work out.

330
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,116
Let go of me.

331
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,872
- You had the gall.
- Just get...

332
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,835
That's the kind of passion
l was hoping l'd find.

333
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,311
You'll find it, Rebecca.

334
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,589
