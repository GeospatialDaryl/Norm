00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,100
        Hey, guys, mail's in.   

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,600
    All right, let's see...

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,000
    Mr. Peterson.               

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,500
Mr. Peterson.                   

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,700
  Mr. Peterson.

Occupant.

Mr. Peterson.

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
Mr. Boyd.                       

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh, hey, that's me.             

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,200
Oh, yeah, I ordered             
this weeks ago.                 

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,500
This is a whole big book        
of crossword puzzles.           

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,800
                All right. Well,
        let's check them out.   

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,700
  Hey, this is great            

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,300
because it has all              
the answers in the back         

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,100
so we don't have to worry       
about all those confusing clues.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,600
All right,                      

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,900
        one across.             

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
        "Penguin."              

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,400
                        Penguin?

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
    Hey, hey, hey, it fits.     

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,400
            All right!          

23
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, these are great once       
 you get the hang of them, huh? 

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
      (theme song begins)       

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,000
   Sometimes you want to go    

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,900
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,700
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,100
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,900
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,800
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,700
Oh, hey, Miss Howe.             

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,900
                  You look nice.
            What's the occasion?

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,800
Well, I just signed up with     
an executive placement agency,  

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,900
      and I have all sorts      
         of interviews          

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,100
    lined up this afternoon.    

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,700
 I feel really great about it.  

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm finally gonna get myself out
of this brain-dead mausoleum.   

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,700
     Oh, no offense, guys.      

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,900
              Huh?              

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,000
        Well, I'm off.          

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,200
        Good luck, Miss Howe.   

43
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
         Thanks, Woody,         
      but I don't need it.      

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,500
  I'm wearing my lucky dress.   
         I can't lose.          

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
                Hi, Sam. I'm off
                to get a job.   

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,800
Nothing can stop me now.        

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,900
                        In that?

48
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, who am I fooling?           

49
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,000
They're not going to hire       
a loser like me.                

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,700
Hey, just saw                   

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,500
the neatest little present      
      in this kids' shop.       

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,300
         Look at this.          

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,200
      Does this say little      
  Freddie Crane or what, huh?   

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
"Babe hound in training."       

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,500
        Afternoon, all.         

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,700
        Hey, Dr. Crane.         

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,100
    Dr. Sternin-Crane.          

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,300
      And little Frederick      
Crane-Sternin-Crane-Crane.      

59
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,900
      What can I get you?       

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
    I know I could use          
    a glass of water.           

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
     Hey, it's my best pal.     

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,900
                  Well, hello to
                  you, too, Sam.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,100
                  Oh, hey, Fras.

64
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,700
                      Hi, there.

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
                Give me five.   

66
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,200
                      Pow!      

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
                 So what are you
                guys doing here?

68
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,200
Someone got a little            
thirsty while we were           
playing in the park.            

69
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,000
                Aw, yeah, I see.
                Need some juice?

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
          You said it.          
      Scotch on the rocks.      

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,500
                I'm joking.     

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
            No, Sam, Uh, just   
            a little apple juice

73
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,300
    and, uh, a couple           
        of ginger ales.         

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,000
      We're having quality      
          family time.          

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,500
                        FRASIER:
                That's right.   

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
  I canceled every single one   
of my appointments today.       

77
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,900
LILITH:                         
And I called in                 
sick to the lab.                

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,700
      I placed some gauze       
    over the telephone          

79
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
and altered my voice            
so as to appear ill.            

80
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
        And the Oscar goes to...

81
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
              Here we are, dear.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
          So, we decided to have
              a lovely afternoon
                  with a picnic,

83
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,300
            and now we're off   
            to go fly a kite.   

84
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
    Oh, hey, I noticed          
    it was windy, too.          

85
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,100
  I went out and I got little   
Frederick this kite, huh?       

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
    What do you think?          

87
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
                        I've got
                        an idea.

88
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,500
  Why don't we, uh, why don't   
    we go try these babies.     

89
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
      I'll be right back.       
    I'm gonna get my jacket.    

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Sam is tagging along?           

91
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,700
We need some time               
to ourselves.                   

92
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,100
                 Well, you know,
             darling, it is Sam.

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
Frasier, am I going             

94
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,300
to have to play "bad cop?"      

95
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,100
Now, let me understand...       

96
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,800
      are you saying that       
    up, up until this point,    

97
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,100
you've been playing "good cop?" 

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,800
Hey, Frasier, I've got an idea. 
  We can tie your little kite   

99
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,900
    to the end of this          
     and make a great tail.     

100
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,400
    (doorbell ringing)          

101
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
            Coming.             

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,100
          I'm coming.           

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
         Oh, it's you.          

104
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,300
     Yeah. Hi, hi, Lilith.      

105
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,600
    Hey, look at you.           

106
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,200
You've got hair like a woman.   

107
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm here to watch               
 <i>Huckleberry Hound.</i>             

108
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
                At 5:53 a.m.?   

109
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Yeah. Yeah.                     

110
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,100
Yesterday, me                   
and Freddie decided             

111
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,900
    we're gonna watch           
         some cartoons.         

112
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,700
          Who decided?          
  The child can barely speak.   

113
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
    Well, he can nod.           
         Hey, Frasier.          

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Hey, Freddie, we're gonna       
      watch the cartoons.       

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,700
That wasn't Sam Malone, was it? 

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
         Please tell me         
  that was an armed intruder.   

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,100
          It was Sam.           

118
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,700
      Frasier, you've got       
        to do something.        

119
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Every day he gets here          

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
    a little earlier,           

121
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
        and every night         
he leaves a little later.       

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,300
         Well, darling,         
  he, he is a friend of ours.   

123
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,000
    It's getting so we can't    
make love in the morning.       

124
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,800
I didn't know we could make love
        in the morning.         

125
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,100
              We can't.         

126
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
 It was just a "for instance."  

127
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,500
The point is                    

128
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,800
 I don't like people seeing me  
        in my nightgown.        

129
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,600
  It undermines my authority.   

130
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,000
    I really wouldn't worry     
          about that.           

131
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,400
     Frasier, do something.     

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,700
    Well, my love, let's...     

133
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,700
 let's try to use some insight  
 into what Sam's going through. 

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,700
                His affection   
                for Frederick   

135
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
            is not unusual under
              the circumstances.

136
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
                 After all, he's
                an aging playboy

137
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,000
        who is just now         
    coming to realize           

138
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,500
    that... he has nothing,     

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
         and that he's          
      got no progeny left       

140
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,700
     to carry on his name.      

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,400
And that is a frightening       
    revelation for any man.     

142
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,700
    Frasier, it's 5:55          
        in the morning.         

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
         The heave-ho.          

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
      Sam, could you come       
    down here, please?          

145
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh, good timing.                
Commercial's on.                

146
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,300
          Sam, there's something
             we have to ask you.

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,900
Yeah, good,                     

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
because there's something       
    we have to ask you, too.    

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,700
     What's for breakfast?      

150
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,900
He's reacting to the nightgown. 

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,800
              Sam, look, as much
                as we adore you,

152
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
 and are happy that you've taken
  such an interest in Frederick,

153
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,800
      we, we're just not getting

154
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
             enough private time
                to ourselves.   

155
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
 Oh, say no more. I understand. 
You guys want to be alone.      

156
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,900
      Sure, tell you what.      

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
  Why don't, uh, Freddie and I  
    go over to my apartment     

158
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,500
      and you can catch up      
         with us later?         

159
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,300
          No, no, Sam.          
    You misunderstand.          

160
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,800
        We're not saying        
  that we want to be intimate   

161
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,100
with each other right now.      

162
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,000
 God forbid while the sun's up. 

163
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
No, no, we're just saying       
that we'd like to spend the day 

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
         with our son,          
     just the three of us.      

165
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,300
              Oh.               

166
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,300
          Well, shoot.          

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
You should have told me sooner. 

168
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,300
      I mean, I don't want      
         to, you know,          

169
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,500
horn in                         
on you guys.                    

170
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
    Tell you what, Freddie,     
        we're gonna have        

171
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
    to watch cartoons           
  some other time, all right?   

172
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,700
Why don't you now go over       
      to your daddy, huh?       

173
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,400
There you go. Go to Daddy.      

174
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,900
Go on, Freddie. It's okay.      

175
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,500
Oh, fine. Now you see           
what you've done?               

176
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,700
My son likes you better         
than he likes me.               

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
      No, don't be silly.       

178
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,400
     Come on, go to Daddy.      
        You'll have fun.        

179
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
         He loves you.          

180
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,300
Oh, now you're                  
being sarcastic.                

181
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,900
I'm not being sarcastic.        

182
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,000
Come on. Come on.               

183
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,700
  Go to your daddy. Go on. Go.  

184
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,000
         Okay, come on.         
  Go, go to your other daddy.   

185
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,700
      Go to Uncle Frasier.      

186
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,100
Sam, you have turned            
my son against me.              

187
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
                         LILITH:
          If you two don't mind,

188
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,000
            I think I'll take   
             our little wishbone

189
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
                into the kitchen
                  for breakfast.

190
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,300
         Oh, this is...         

191
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,500
        Fras, I'm sorry.        

192
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Sam, he's my son.               

193
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,200
I made him.                     
I get to keep him.              

194
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,900
                  Come on, Fras.
                      Calm down.

195
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
This is my house, my child      
          and my wife,          

196
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
      who, thanks to you,       
     I don't even have time     

197
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,000
to make love to in the morning. 

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
     I thought you said...      

199
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,200
     All right, I'm raving!     

200
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
                I'm sorry.      

201
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,600
                It's just, uh...
                I like your kid.

202
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,100
                I didn't know   
            I liked kids before.

203
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
If you like kids so much,       

204
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
why don't you get               
one of your own.                

205
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, Sam, Sam,                   
look, I'm sorry.                

206
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,000
        Oh, that's all right.   

207
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,500
You, you know                   
I love you, right?              

208
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,900
I think you're one of the       
greatest guys in the world.     

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
It's, it's just, it's           
just a little bit early         

210
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,300
on a Saturday morning to, to    
lose the love of your child.    

211
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
Now, if you...                  
you'd just excuse me            

212
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,300
I, I think I'll go try          
to bond with my son             

213
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,600
                     over a bowl
                 of Froot Loops.

214
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,700
  Oh, God, I love Froot Loops.  

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,100
         Sorry, sorry.          

216
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,400
      Oh, hey, Miss Howe.       

217
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,200
                         How was
                 your interview?

218
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,100
      Did it go any better      
        than the others?        

219
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,300
      Oh, yeah, the usual.      

220
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,300
    You know, I was sitting     
      in the waiting room       

221
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,900
    and got kind of nervous     
so I just had a quick cigarette.

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,300
     You know, and that was     
    pretty much that.           

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,800
      Think you could stop      
      throwing that thing?      

224
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,200
 Why? Gives me something to do. 

225
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,600
    We've got to talk.          

226
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
      You know, ever since      
    I've been hanging around    

227
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
 with Frasier and Lilith's kid, 
              I...              

228
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
        (knocking)              

229
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
 Sammy, uh, you don't expect me 
 to pay for this beer, do you?  

230
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
              No.               

231
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,100
             Good.              

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
Come on, what's wrong?          

233
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,200
     Do you think guys have     
      a biological clock?       

234
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,100
    You know, like they know    
 when it's time to have a kid?  

235
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,500
    Oh, yeah.                   

236
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,700
     Usually when they say,     

237
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,500
     "Hey, Carla, you want      
      to go out tonight?"       

238
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,700
Come on. What's on your mind?   

239
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,700
Well, I've been thinking.       

240
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
You know, I'm, I'm not          
that young anymore.             

241
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,300
It's not that I'm old.          
It's just... that I'm not young.

242
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
    I'm not old-old.            

243
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
    I'm just youngish.          

244
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,500
         You know, I'm,         
      I'm a youngish man.       

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
                Please go on.   

246
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,700
  Well, I'm thinking about...   
  thinking about being a dad.   

247
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,800
                     What?      

248
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
        Yeah.                   

249
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
You know, I've been playing     
around all my life              

250
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,900
and, I don't know, you know,    
maybe I'm missing something.    

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
                Have you thought
            about getting a dog?

252
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,100
      I don't want a dog.       

253
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,700
    You know, I want someone    
          to be with,           

254
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
      to, to take care of,      
         to watch grow.         

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,800
                Have you thought
          about getting a plant?

256
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
        You don't think         
     I'll be a good father?     

257
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,900
             Oh, no, no, I think
        you'd be a great father.

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,900
            Do you have a mother
                     picked out?

259
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,700
    No, not really.             

260
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,200
                        Oh.     

261
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,000
             Does that mean, uh,
     you're not going to ask me?

262
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,000
    Well, I'm, I'm sorry.       

263
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,600
    You know, I didn't          
         think of that.         

264
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
      Yeah, would you?          

265
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,100
             What are you, nuts?

266
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,000
    Do you think I'm gonna go   
    through labor an eighth time

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
                  because you're
                a little lonely?

268
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,100
        Selfish bastard.        

269
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
         Aw, you know,          
with me it doesn't matter.      

270
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,900
         What the heck?         
    I know a hundred women.     

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,900
          (chuckles):           
    What am I talking about?    

272
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,600
I know thousands of women.      

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
        What am I talking about?

274
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
                  I know tens of
             thousands of women.

275
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,700
    Wait, wait, wait.           
    What am I talking about?    

276
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,400
             Sam...             

277
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
come on, now,                   

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
just think about this           
for a minute.                   

279
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
Do you really, really want this?

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
        Yeah, I really,         
    really want this.           

281
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,300
         Come on, Sam.          

282
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,600
      Do you have any idea      
  what it means to have a kid?  

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
  It's changing dirty diapers   
and getting spit-up stains      

284
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,700
    on those shoulders          
  of your best clothes, and...  

285
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
and ear infections              
in the middle of the night,     

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,700
    and shoving antibiotics     
      down their throats,       

287
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,900
    and worrying about them     
every day and every night       

288
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
for the rest of your life.      

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,900
      How does <i>that</i> sound?      

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,100
          Sounds cool.          

291
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
          (chuckles):           
             Yeah.              

292
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,700
        It is, kind of.         

293
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,600
        Would they, like, really
     spit it up on, um, leather?

294
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,900
          (chuckles):           
     Oh, they know fabrics.     

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,100
So, who's gonna be              
the mom, Sam?                   

296
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
            I haven't figured   
            that out yet, Woody,

297
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,900
        but, you know, she's got
        to be somewhere in here.

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,900
                        Or here.

299
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
          (door opens)          

300
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,900
Well, what about Miss Howe?     

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She's getting                   
up there like you.              

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
She's probably about            
ready to have a kid.            

303
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,700
And she's very responsible.     

304
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,500
        I think that was        
     my best interview yet.     

305
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,500
    I think that they really    
     were impressed with me     

306
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
  until I accidentally knocked  
the CEO into a fax machine      

307
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,400
  and sent a copy of his butt   
          to Wichita.           

308
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
See, Sam, you could've          
asked her just now.             

309
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,900
Oh, wait a minute.              
Here you go.                    

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Now, this could work out.       

311
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,100
        What am I doing?        
      What am I gonna say?      

312
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
      I have to figure out      
    how to word this.           

313
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,400
            Hold on a second.   

314
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,700
                Excuse me, miss?

315
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,200
            Uh, can I ask you   
                     a question?
Sure.                           

316
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,200
                 All right, just
            hypothetically, now,

317
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
 say someone you've been dating,
        you know, a couple times

318
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,100
        calls you up to say, uh,
            "Hey, we had some   
                laughs together.

319
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,900
    What say we have a baby?"   

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
            Now, I'm not talking
                commitment here;
         don't misunderstand me.

321
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,800
            You know, maybe yes,
                    maybe no.   

322
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,100
             The picture is: get
        pregnant, have the baby,

323
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,600
         give it to me, go away.

324
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,900
                        Uh...   

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,700
         you know, just offhand,
    how would you react to that?

326
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,100
    How would I react           
     if a guy called me up      

327
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,600
          and asked me          
    to be a breeder for him?    

328
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,100
To be sort of an incubator      
         for his seed?          

329
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,300
                  Yeah, exactly.
                W-Wait a second.

330
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,100
            Let me, uh... let   
                me get a pencil.

331
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,400
                 I want to write
                      this down.

332
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,500
                    Okay.       

333
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,800
    Okay, "incubator."          

334
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
        "Breeder."              

335
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,500
        Red-flag words.         

336
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,800
  You know, uh, if it's a boy,  

337
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,400
    I just hope he names it     
    Clifford Clavin Malone.     

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,100
 I don't care what he names it  

339
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
     as long as he doesn't      
    bring it in here.           

340
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,700
      If there's one thing      
  I can't stand, it's babies.   

341
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,400
Oh, come on, Mr. Krapence.      

342
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,300
Wouldn't you like               
a helpless little guy           

343
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,000
all soft and cuddly             
who you could burp              
every once in a while?          

344
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,100
             Yeah, we need      
         another one of those.  

345
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,700
          (door opens)          

346
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,400
         Sam.                   

347
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,400
Listen, Sam, I... I'd like      
to apologize about this morning 

348
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
     when I kicked you out.     

349
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,200
I...                            

350
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,100
    I forgot how much           
      Freddie means to you      

351
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
 and how much you mean to him.  

352
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,400
I also forgot that Lilith and I 
        have two tickets        

353
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,300
  to <i>Jerome Robbins' Broadway</i>   
tonight-- hundred bucks a throw.

354
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
     If you think I'm gonna     
    miss that, you're nuts.     

355
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,100
Have fun, Freddie.              
Daddy loves you.                

356
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
                Hey, you want me
                to lock up, Sam?

357
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,800
No, thanks. I got to wait       
for Frasier and Lilith.         

358
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,400
All right. Good night.          
                     Good night.

359
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
    Hey, little buddy.          

360
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,300
      So, what do you want      
    to watch there, Freddie?    

361
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
     (music playing on TV)      
             Whew!

                 Blue Hawaii

        (ocean purring,

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,300
                    Hey, Sam.   

374
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
What?                           

375
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
                            Sam.

376
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,900
        Who's there?            

377
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,600
                Up-up here, Sam.
                 It's me, Elvis.

378
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
      Elvis?                    

379
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
                Yeah. Come on   
                 over here, man.

380
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,800
            I don't want to have
                to shout at you.

381
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,700
I'm having a dream about Elvis. 

382
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
What do you want with me, Elvis?

383
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,000
                  I want to tell
                  you something.

384
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,400
              You're right about
                wanting a child.

385
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,700
        You know, the best thing
        that ever happened to me

386
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,500
          was having Lisa Marie.

387
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,900
    Here. Isn't she precious?   

388
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah, she's a real cutie.       

389
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
     Well, you'll be happy      
        to know, Elvis,         

390
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,000
         she turned out         
    to be a real babe.          

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
              Sam, don't make me
        come through this TV.   

392
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
        I'm sorry.              

393
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,100
          Now, this baby's gonna
            need a mama, Sam.   

394
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
    Yeah, I know that,          
        Elvis, but I...         

395
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,800
I can't think of anybody.       

396
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
              Well, I just think
     you're overlooking someone.

397
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,800
              Who?              

398
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
              Miss Rebecca Howe.

399
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,600
            Rebecca?            

400
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,200
                   <i>Miss</i> Rebecca.

401
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
                      She's been
                  a true friend,

402
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,900
             and-and you've been
    through so much together.   

403
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,100
        There's a lot of love   
              in her heart, Sam.

404
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,300
                  She has no one
                  to give it to.

405
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
                     And she's a
                 handsome woman.

406
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,300
     Miss Rebecca? Really?      

407
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,500
        Think about her, Sam.   
            I know I'm right.   

408
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
                  Now, if you'll
            just excuse me, man.

409
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,800
            I got to go back and
              frolic on a beach,

410
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,700
  or jump in a stock car race   
         or something.          

411
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
     I don't know what they     
got me doing in this one.       

412
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,600
          Later, Sam.           

413
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,900
    Isn't this sweet?           

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,700
My son and his baby-sitter      
      passed out in a bar.      

415
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
    (Frederick fusses)          

416
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,900
        No, it's okay... Ooh!   
    Sam. Sam.                   

417
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,200
I've got him, Sam.              

418
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
                        Fras.   
      Thanks.                   

419
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,700
                         Yeah.  

420
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,500
            Say... Frasier.     

421
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,500
                Whew!           

422
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,300
         Weirdest thing         
      just happened to me.      

423
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,300
 I could have sworn I just, uh, 

424
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
    just had a conversation     
      with Elvis Presley.       

425
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,400
        Well, Sam, I've had, uh,
        four or five patients   

426
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,100
            that have had the   
                same experience.

427
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
     I'll simply... simply      
tell you what I told them.      

428
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
        The man is dead.        

429
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,300
            Hi, Sam.            

430
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,500
      Hi. Wh-What are you       
        doing back here?        

431
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
      My night to lock up.      

432
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
     Besides, it looks like     

433
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,500
    I'm still gonna be          
      working here anyway.      

434
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,700
Nobody else wants me.           

435
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
                Oh, I'm sorry   
                to hear that.   

436
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,700
Yeah, well, you know,           

437
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,900
maybe I've been barking up      
the wrong tree my whole life.   

438
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,500
All these big dreams about      
being a big corporate executive 

439
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,600
and, you know, having           
a lot of power...               

440
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
 a lot of control.              

441
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,900
I don't know why I've been      
knocking my brains out.         

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,100
Maybe I should have             
just settled                    

443
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,900
for some dumb, ordinary jerk,   
you know, and raised a family.  

444
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,700
                    Wow.        

445
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,400
What?                           

446
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,200
          I was just, uh... I...

447
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
             you know, I've been
        thinking the same thing.

448
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
  Only, you know, I was thinking
    that you should have a child

449
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,100
        with someone who is, you
    know, good-looking and...   

450
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,400
              and really cool.  

451
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,700
Yeah, well, I don't know        
anybody like that.              

452
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,700
                  What about me?

453
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
What, you know                  
somebody like that?             

454
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,000
              No, you know, I...

455
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,500
            what I mean is, I   
            was thinking that...

456
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,400
        you and I should have   
                a baby together.

457
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,400
     (laughs)                   

458
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,700
Oh, come on, Sam!               
                         What?  

459
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
            No, why? Why not?   

460
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,400
    I mean, think about it.     

461
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
You and I                       
are good friends--              

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,300
hell, you're                    
my best friend--                

463
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,000
and we've been through          
a lot together,                 

464
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
and, you know, you... you       
have a lot of love to give,     

465
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,600
and you're                      
a handsome woman.               

466
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
          Well, I-I'm flattered.

467
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,600
But I'm just... I'm not ready   
  to have a baby, Sam, you know?

468
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,700
        I got a lot of things   
          left to do in my life.

469
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,600
Yeah? Like what?                
                Like a <i>lot.</i>     

470
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,000
Well, all right, name one.      

471
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,900
         Well, like I had always
          planned on growing old

472
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
                  and, you know,
                    dying alone.

473
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
     You can still do that.     

474
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,200
Well, you don't just, you know, 

475
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,100
     go out and have a baby     
         with somebody.         

476
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,800
            Why not?            

477
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,400
  Well, I don't know why not.   

478
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
         Then why not?          

479
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,900
    And why with you?           

480
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
             Why not?           

481
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,100
         Well, but...           

482
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,300
          Why not?              

483
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,100
      I mean, we could.         

484
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,500
                        Yeah.   

485
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,300
And <i>your</i> mom did it.            
     <i>My</i> mom did...              

486
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,100
  I mean, Carla does it         
      all the time.             

487
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
I mean, I... why shouldn't <i>we?</i>  

488
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,900
    I mean, and, you know,      
maybe this would be something   

489
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
that I'd finally be good at.    

490
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,700
                So, will you?   

491
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,100
      'Kay.                     

492
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,100
Let's have a baby.              

493
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
You know, I think this is       
gonna change my whole life.     

494
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,800
                    Oh, yeah.   

495
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,000
        I think, no more        
    Rebecca the jerk,           

496
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
 no more Rebecca the goonball,  
    Rebecca the loser.          

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
      Rebecca the mother!       

498
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
         I'm gonna have         
    a brand-new human baby!     

499
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,400
    I get to feed her.          
    I get to hold her!          

500
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,700
Oh!                             

501
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
         I can't wait!          

502
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,600
     You know, a new life!      

503
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,400
    A new life that depends     
    completely on me!           

504
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,900
          (clattering)          

505
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,500
    Do you believe it?          
    I forgot my coat!           

506
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,700
            (gasps):            
  I guess I'm just so excited   
    about this whole thing!     

507
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,600
         I don't know.          
     I'm gonna be a mommy!      

508
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,600
          (giggling)            

509
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,300
     (coatrack clattering)      
          Oh, a mommy!          

510
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
 You'd better be right, Elvis.  

511
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:54,853
