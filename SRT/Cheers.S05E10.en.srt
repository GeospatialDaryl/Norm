Practicing for that Mother of

00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,536
Shut up!

43
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,038
What seems to be the problem?

44
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,040
I've been planning my Elvis pilgrimage

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,542
to Memphis for weeks, and
now Nick is backing out

46
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,544
of taking care of the kids.

47
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,046
He says his appendix burst.

48
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,848
Well, that seems serious to me.

49
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,384
His appendix bursts
every time I need a favor.

50
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:52,105
Boy, if he was smart,
he'd have that removed.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,808
Hello, one and all.

52
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,060
Hello.

53
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,062
How are you, love of my life? Just fine,

54
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,446
pain in my neck.

55
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:05,401
The most exciting thing has happened.

56
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:06,402
You'll never guess.

57
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,655
I got a letter

58
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,956
from Syzygy.

59
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,710
Stop it! Yeah!

60
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,547
All right, all right, who's Syzygy?

61
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:21,050
It's not a who-- it's
a new literary review,

62
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,053
dedicated to publishing
the prose and poetry

63
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,556
that's right on the cutting edge.

64
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,558
Well, I, for one, am
excited for you, Diane.

65
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,310
Ah, there, it passed.

66
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,813
Oh... let-let me have a look at it.

67
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,181
What does the letter say?

68
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,650
Well, I submitted one of my poems

69
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,653
for publication, and quite honestly,

70
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,655
I was overwhelmed by the response.

71
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,408
It was more than I could
ever have hoped for.

72
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,744
But I blush. Read it.

73
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,245
It speaks for itself.

74
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:50,747
(giggles)

75
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:53,249
Oh, uh...

76
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,251
this is a rejection letter.

77
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,253
It's not a rejection letter per se.

78
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:02,258
It's a "soon and inevitably
to be accepted" letter.

79
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,127
Listen to this.

80
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:07,597
"Your work is not
entirely without promise."

81
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,099
They're almost begging
for another submission.

82
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,852
Boy, you know, I...

83
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,139
I hope you don't get your
hopes up there too high,

84
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,142
because that looks like
a form letter to me.

85
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,527
Poor Sam.

86
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,279
This really threatens you, doesn't it?

87
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,281
Let me assure you that I can heed

88
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,784
my man as well as my muse.

89
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,787
Syzygy would not even have
bothered to respond to my letter

90
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:35,792
if they hadn't perceived me as
an up-and-coming literary talent.

91
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,293
You know, this is just like you.

92
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,163
You-you turn every
defeat into a victory.

93
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,464
It's like the time when I said

94
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,966
that I didn't want to see you anymore,

95
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,968
and you all of a sudden
start making wedding plans.

96
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,720
Sam, we can talk about the
wedding later-- I have work to do.

97
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:53,893
You know, I bet I could, uh,
send a poem to that magazine

98
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,179
and get the same letter
back that you did.

99
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:59,182
Oh, Sam, you don't want to write a poem.

100
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:02,185
Poetry is very, very difficult.

101
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:05,071
What's the big deal? All
you got to do is rhyme.

102
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,741
Most great modern poetry

103
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,526
doesn't necessarily have to rhyme.

104
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,028
Well, that's even easier, isn't it?

105
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:17,533
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

106
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:20,920
Go ahead, write your little poem.

107
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,756
You don't think I can
even write a stupid poem.

108
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,258
Of course you can.

109
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,627
Don't forget to capitalize
the first letter.

110
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,546
I'm gonna do this.

111
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:34,050
I'm gonna show you that I can
be as much of a reject as you.

112
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,437
I told you, I was not rejected.

113
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,138
Whatever. Now, if you'll excuse me,

114
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,475
I have a little creating to do.

115
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,785
Coffee...

116
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,572
(quietly): Any of you guys
know how to write poetry?

117
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:59,075
Uh, I know how to make fun of 'em.

118
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,576
No.

119
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,668
Great, Nick. That's wonderful.

120
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:13,639
You're not as much of a scum
bucket as I thought you were.

121
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,392
No, that's not an
attempt at reconciliation.

122
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:19,228
Hey, Nick's gonna take care of the kids.

123
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,730
Graceland, here I come.

124
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,231
Hey, all right. Hey, all right.

125
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,100
Didn't you go to Graceland last year?

126
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,436
Yeah, but this is special--
I mean, how many times

127
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,938
does the tenth anniversary
of Elvis's death roll around?

128
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:32,325
Don't ask me. I wasn't a fan.

129
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,581
Hi, Sam.

130
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,583
Hello.

131
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,586
Sam, have you received
that rejection letter

132
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,088
for your poem yet?

133
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,423
No, I haven't.

134
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,292
Hmm.

135
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:53,179
The letter I received
arrived within two weeks

136
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,931
of my submission, and here it is,

137
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,600
three weeks, and nothing for you.

138
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,969
Isn't that odd?

139
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,971
Odd.

140
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,973
What's this?

141
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:06,776
It's that magazine you
couldn't get your poetry into.

142
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,197
Thank you, Woody.

143
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,150
I mean, what is it doing here?

144
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,652
Well, I decided if
I'm gonna try to write,

145
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,655
I might as well read
some of that poetry stuff.

146
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,658
Sam, that's very commendable.

147
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,160
I didn't realize

148
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,662
the new issue was out.
Yeah, it's not bad, either.

149
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,414
They got one I really like.

150
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,750
Page 37, I believe.

151
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,752
Yeah, read it out loud.

152
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,754
It'd be good for me to hear.

153
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,755
All right.

154
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,142
"Nocturne" by Sam Mal... oh!

155
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,155
Now... ooh, Diane, come on, please,

156
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,040
books are our friends.

157
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,329
The page is 37 there.

158
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,331
Yes, thank you. Yeah.

159
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,333
Well... (chuckles)

160
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:08,337
Diane Chambers is nothing
if not open-minded.

161
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,339
Perhaps you...

162
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,724
you do have some

163
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,176
spark of talent.

164
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,060
They published your poem, huh?

165
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,511
CLIFF: All right!

166
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,013
Hey, don't let it get out, though,

167
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,014
that I'm a sensitive guy.

168
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,899
Oh, yeah, yeah!

169
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,901
Hey, Sammy!

170
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:27,740
Very well, I've arrived
at my objective opinion.

171
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,409
All right. This is one of the most...

172
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,246
amateurish, hackneyed,
odious pieces of effluvium

173
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,114
ever to wash down the pike.

174
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,617
Listen to this drivel.

175
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,538
"I fly through a puckish arena,

176
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,540
"where echoes dance, where echoes dance,

177
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,044
where echoes dance..."

178
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:49,929
This sounds familiar.

179
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,265
Well, you said it three times.

180
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,637
This poem is plagiarized.

181
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,055
Oh, now I stole it?

182
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,557
And a minute ago, you said it stunk.

183
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,558
It does stink.

184
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,477
Leave it to you to not have the sense

185
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,978
to steal something worthwhile.

186
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,363
Aw, you know, I realize

187
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,732
that it's tough to
have somebody come along

188
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,234
and swipe your dreams of glory,

189
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,619
so I will not take
offense at that remark.

190
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,072
That poem is fraudulent,

191
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,708
and I intend to find its true source,

192
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,494
even if I have to search through
every greeting card to do so.

193
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,496
(Sam laughs)

194
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:27,250
Believe me, Sam Malone, I
will not rest until today,

195
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,585
the blackest day in the
history of literature,

196
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,971
is blotted out for all eternity.

197
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,257
Diane, I think you're
getting overexcited.

198
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,142
Uh, why don't you just calm down?

199
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,760
I tell you, I've just come

200
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,061
from my Coping With Anxiety Group,

201
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,563
and I have just the trick.

202
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:42,815
Now, here.

203
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,150
Put this over your head and breathe.

204
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,939
I assure you, I am in complete control.

205
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,908
I think the bag's a good idea anyhow.

206
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,449
It's been proven time and time again

207
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:03,452
that reincarnation breaks no
physical laws as we know 'em.

208
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,955
You know, I was thinking
about this the other day,

209
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,457
and, uh, I think in my next life

210
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:11,844
I'd like to come back as
the president of France.

211
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,629
Why is that, Wood?

212
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,133
Well, I think it'd attract
a lot of business to the bar.

213
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,391
Coffee, Woody.

214
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,643
Oh, sure thing, Miss Chambers.

215
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,529
I'll take the pot.

216
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:35,201
Say, what's with Diane there?

217
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,870
FRASIER: She's still
searching for Sam's poem.

218
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,323
Dr. Crane, I think you
ought to talk to her.

219
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,825
I mean, all she does
is read, read, read.

220
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,211
I bet she goes through a book a week.

221
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,551
Uh...

222
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,387
Diane, uh,

223
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,255
Diane, you don't smoke.

224
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,757
What's your point?

225
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,763
Hey, there!

226
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,766
Still looking for that poem, huh?

227
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,020
I'm sure it's a post-war piece.

228
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,822
It's not British. The syntax is wrong.

229
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,741
I have a hunch it might be regional.

230
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,160
You may not believe this, but, uh,

231
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,162
I do sympathize with you.

232
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:21,914
It's not easy

233
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,700
to watch those people you scoffed at

234
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,704
run past you while you
remain stuck in the mud

235
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,589
like a weighted-down elephant.

236
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,009
Made that up.

237
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,514
Does this mean that
you've stopped trying

238
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,516
to get your poetry published?

239
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,017
Not at all.

240
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,519
Oh...

241
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,522
I'm diligently producing new work.

242
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,023
Well, that-that's good.

243
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:51,026
Uh, I'd love to talk to you about it.

244
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,895
Uh, how's it goin', Diane?

245
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,231
Would you like to know how it's going?

246
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,232
Yeah.

247
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,736
This is how it's going.

248
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,738
I'm totally blocked.

249
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,240
I can't write another word.

250
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,541
Hmm.

251
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,377
"Hurricane of Wills," unfinished.

252
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:12,882
"The Death of a Shallow
Man," unfinished.

253
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:18,387
"A Bartender Dismembered,"

254
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:19,255
unfinished.

255
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,594
I suffer failure after
failure while you, a despoiler

256
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:26,512
of the English language

257
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,014
are lionized in front of the world.

258
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,021
That's how it's going.

259
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,024
Well, maybe this little literary chat

260
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,026
wasn't such a good idea.

261
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,528
Wanna make out?

262
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,283
Well...

263
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,286
Make out?

264
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:51,787
Diane, now listen, uh, listen,

265
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,789
I think the joke's gone
far enough, don't you?

266
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,791
You haven't eaten a
decent meal in a week.

267
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,043
You're living off of
cigarettes and coffee.

268
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,378
I mean, for God's sake,

269
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,765
this little literary magazine's
circulation must be what, 600.

270
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,216
That's just the beginning.

271
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,602
You see,

272
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:10,356
the original 600 readers
drop their copies on buses,

273
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,643
in taxicabs and doctors' offices.

274
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,645
And another 600 people pick them up

275
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,647
and take them to the airport,

276
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,533
where they go all over the country.

277
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,369
And then they get taken
on international flights.

278
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,321
Tierra del Fuego, Sierra Leone;

279
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,206
all the remotest parts of the world.

280
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,875
And soon, I defy you to find me a house,

281
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,828
a hut, an igloo or a wickiup

282
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:36,332
that doesn't have a
copy on the coffee table.

283
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,717
Diane...

284
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,718
And then, then, then

285
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,170
(voice breaking): everyone in the world,

286
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,057
every living thing
will be laughing at me!

287
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,844
Because he got published, and I did not!

288
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,148
Hi, everybody, I'm back!

289
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,150
CLIFF: Hey, Carla!

290
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,652
How was the trip?

291
00:13:56,652 --> 00:14:00,656
Greatest vacation I have
ever taken in my life.

292
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,158
Graceland does not disappoint.

293
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,028
And to commemorate the
special anniversary,

294
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,864
I had this picture
taken of me and Elvis.

295
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,866
CLIFF: Oh, look at that.

296
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:11,867
How do they do that?

297
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,752
They use cardboard cutouts.

298
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,506
Wow, you know, you look
almost lifelike here.

299
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,430
So do you, Woody.

300
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,216
Woody, more coffee.

301
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,969
Okay, Miss Chambers.

302
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,855
I've got something to cheer ya up.

303
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:35,274
I sent in a poem to
that magazine of yours.

304
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:40,062
Oh, my God, don't tell me
that they published yours, too?

305
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:43,399
No, I got one of your

306
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,902
"soon and inevitably
to be accepted" letters.

307
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:53,826
Huh? That's pretty exciting.

308
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,828
Oh, my God.

309
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,496
Sam was right.

310
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,134
Sam the Bard.

311
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,341
It was a form letter all along.

312
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,178
We two were sent a
condescending form letter.

313
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,180
I'm framing mine.

314
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,996
Hi.

315
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,500
You okay?

316
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,370
You win, Sam.

317
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,674
I've struggled so hard for so long

318
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,593
to keep my dreams alive,

319
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,962
and I haven't fooled anyone but myself.

320
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:51,266
I know all along you all considered me

321
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:55,938
a pretentious, self-deluded windbag

322
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:59,942
and apparently, you've all been right.

323
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,445
I'm never going to be Diane
Chambers, the great poet,

324
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,364
the world-famous novelist,

325
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,567
the revered artist.

326
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,571
I've gone as high as I'm going to go.

327
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,823
I'm a waitress in a beer hall...

328
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:20,295
...and not a very good one.

329
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,383
A waitress.

330
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:27,836
A waitress.

331
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,840
A waitress.

332
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,592
Miss,

333
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,760
could you take our order?

334
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,095
(sobbing)

335
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,067
Come on. Let's go have
a talk in my office.

336
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,569
Come on.

337
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,070
Sweetheart?

338
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,033
Okay, come on, sweetheart. Come on.

339
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,536
Sit in the big chair there.

340
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,044
Okay, I have something,
uh, I have to say here.

341
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,846
And, uh, I just want you to promise

342
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,215
before I say it

343
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,968
that you, uh, won't go crazy.

344
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,269
Don't worry.

345
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,771
I've hit rock bottom.

346
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,273
I have no emotions left.

347
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:25,277
Oh, all right. Um...

348
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,648
I, uh, I did copy that poem.

349
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,318
You are scum.

350
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,041
I tried to make one up
myself, but I-I just couldn't,

351
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,660
and so I-I copied one.

352
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,580
I never thought it would
be published, I promise.

353
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,801
What could you possibly
have been thinking of, Sam?

354
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,337
It obviously had been
published to begin with.

355
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,224
No, no, no, it hadn't.

356
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,892
Well, then please tell me.

357
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,677
I think you owe me that much.

358
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,062
Where did it come from?

359
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,982
Well, actually, it,
uh, came from a letter

360
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,486
that you wrote to me.

361
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,242
One of my letters?

362
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,027
Mm-hmm.

363
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,029
And when you didn't
recognize it out there,

364
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,032
I decided to play it out,

365
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,919
and rub your smug little nose in it.

366
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,006
I'm sorry. I probably went too far.

367
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,962
Oh, my God, it's one of mine.

368
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:37,933
How could I not recognize
this exquisite fluidity?

369
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,354
The characteristic Chambers' grace

370
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,106
in the face of hard imagery?

371
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,525
Come on. You told me that it stunk.

372
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,311
Sam, I'm a poet, not a critic.

373
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,148
Oh...

374
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,149
I'm published!

375
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,150
Yeah!

376
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,152
I'm published!

377
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,654
Oh, this is so exciting!

378
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:02,124
This is like... like
the first time I ever...

379
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,626
rode a bicycle.

380
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,545
Oh, this is great.

381
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,546
You're-you're not mad.

382
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,833
Mad? I'm elated.

383
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,218
Hey, all... I'm elated, too.

384
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,722
Oh, what a glorious day.

385
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,724
I'm going to go do what poets do...

386
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:21,176
...drink myself stinky.

387
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,010
(laughs)

388
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,517
Wait a minute.

389
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:31,019
This always happens.

390
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:35,524
You always squirm out of
these things unscathed.

391
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,359
You did a terrible thing!

392
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,194
I know it.

393
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:41,163
No, you don't.

394
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:46,118
You put me through hell.

395
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,121
This time it's going to be different.

396
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,622
I'm going to make you suffer.

397
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,958
What-what're you going to do?

398
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,962
I don't know.

399
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,963
Yes, I do.

400
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,966
You're going out there
and admit to everyone

401
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,468
that you stole this poem from me.

402
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,471
Oh, come on, you mean I have to go out

403
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,474
and tell the whole bar
that I'm not a poet?

404
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,361
You sure do, mister.

405
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,112
Let's go.

406
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:22,905
(gasps)

407
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,406
What? What? What? What? What? Mm...

408
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,912
What are you doin'?

409
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,418
Oh, yeah, I've heard about this.

410
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,423
Mm-mm.

411
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:47,813
You wanna go back to my
place and ride a bike?

412
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,820
Don't you ever, ever
again try to tell me

413
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,822
that you don't love me.

414
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,191
Oh, God, every time I think I'm about

415
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,158
to get my hedge clipped,

416
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,660
you start talkin' about love,

417
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,161
and it's just not fair.

418
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,447
You saved my love letters.

419
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,700
I was so excited about
being a published poet,

420
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,202
it didn't sink in at first.

421
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,203
This proves it.

422
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,705
You love me now as you always did,

423
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,207
madly and completely.

424
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,708
Hey, wait, listen to me.

425
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,460
I did not save your letters.

426
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,462
Where did this come from?

427
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,214
I found it in my apartment.

428
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,016
I got pizza boxes that old

429
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,019
that have more meaning. Come on.

430
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,520
Sam Malone, look me in the eyes

431
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,522
and tell me you don't love me.

432
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,523
If you can do that,

433
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,026
then I have no choice
but to believe you.

434
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,448
Oh, boy, I'm sorry, but...

435
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,453
...I don't love you, Diane.

436
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,238
Uh, I thought I did once,

437
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,240
but I was wrong.

438
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,743
There's nothin' goin'
on between us here.

439
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,245
I mean, it's all over.

440
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,252
Very well.

441
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,255
That was in the eyes, wasn't it?

442
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,256
I guess I'll go

443
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,259
before I make a bigger fool of myself.

444
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:38,006
Aha!

445
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,876
What the hell are you doing?

446
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,263
I came to catch you in a lie, and I did.

447
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,766
Don't I know my darling
better than anyone else?

448
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,770
Okay, so I kept some of
your letters. Big deal.

449
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,772
I mean, that doesn't prove anything.

450
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,140
I mean, I got lots of junk in here.

451
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,941
Look at this.

452
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,442
I save all sorts of things.

453
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,944
Look-look at that. Where is it?

454
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,445
A warranty for my toaster.

455
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,447
Look at that, huh?

456
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,449
My letters.

457
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,450
A ticket--
here-here it is--

458
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,953
a ticket to, uh, 1980 boat show.

459
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,454
Your protests only prove my point.

460
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,957
There, poker chips. Three poker chips.

461
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,458
You know, Sam, Each
one of these poker chips

462
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,460
I was thinking. means more
to me than your letters.

463
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,462
You know when we finally
do get married, A key.

464
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,964
we could move to the country. A whistle.

465
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,465
Not too far away Look
at that-- a whistle.

466
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,967
because I couldn't be
far from the theater.

467
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,969
A double-C battery. And I know
how much you love the ocean.

468
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,972
Sam...

469
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,724
Four paper clips.
