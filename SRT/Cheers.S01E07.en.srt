1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,554
Diane. Do me a favour.
Pour Mischa there a real quick beer.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,836
Coming right up, Mischa.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,591
There you go.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,519
Sam, what is he doing with his hand?

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,155
He plays cymbals for the Symphony.
They're in the middle of a concert.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,671
He's counting out a long rest
so he knows exactly when to get back.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,919
Fascinating. OK, that's 1 .25
out of a 20. 1 .50, 1 .75,

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,237
two, three, four, five, ten and 20.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,838
Musicians are very temperamental.

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,069
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,155
Norman.

12
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,636
- How's life, Norm?
- Not for the squeamish, Coach.

13
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,752
You're shaking
like a meringue in an earthquake.

14
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,557
My whole career as an accountant,

15
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,796
l sat in my cubicle,
kept my mouth shut.

16
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,469
- Today l volunteered for something.
- What?

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,478
Every year,
the firm has a company party.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,795
- Yeah?
- Guess who's party director.

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,229
Let me guess. l'm good at guessing.

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,752
Julius LaRosa?

21
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,440
Warm, Coach. Me.

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,028
Gee, l should've taken more time.

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,749
Probably.

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,555
- How come you volunteered?
- To make points with the big boss.

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,151
Last year, some nobody named Jensen
threw a luau in the parking lot.

26
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,556
lt was a big hit.
You know where that man is today?

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,638
Leaning over my shoulder
saying, ''Add faster.''

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,556
What are you so upset about?
lt sounds like a great opportunity.

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,399
That's what l thought.

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,751
But after l volunteered,
l realised l never threw a party.

31
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,677
l killed a few.

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,394
What's the big deal?
You want excitement,

33
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,670
pay a sexy chick
to jump out of a cake.

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,234
lf you want to save money,
get Carla to do it.

35
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,358
Carla.

36
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,277
Strippers aren't enough here.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,868
Will you relax? Life's too short.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,834
You don't understand.
We're talking about 1 00 accountants.

39
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,633
Their lives are incredibly dull
all week long.

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,991
l gotta do something special
to turn them on, wake 'em up.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,237
The best party l was ever at
was in a locker room.

42
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,955
We were all in our underwear,
pouring champagne on each other.

43
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,755
Guys flinging guys into showers.
lt was terrific.

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,838
That was after
we'd won the division championship.

45
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,589
- That's why we were in Cleveland.
- Right.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,635
Norm, l've got a great idea.
Have yourself a hot-tub party.

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,957
- What?
- The latest craze in California.

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,036
You know, Weirdo Central.

49
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,230
Get a bunch of people in a hot tub,
who knows what'll happen?

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,955
Today l delivered two copies
of <i>Star Parade</i> magazine.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,231
- Guess who's on the cover in a tub?
- Julius LaRosa?

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,912
No, Burt Reynolds.

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,554
l used to be so good at this game.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,117
l did think of one icebreaker.
l go through this year's audits,

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,631
find the biggest mistakes,
Xerox them and pass them around.

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,716
We're talking monster laughs.

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,909
You're a maniac, Normie.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,636
Perhaps l can give you an idea
that you could actually use.

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,035
l think parties are the most fun

60
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,836
when you can shed your everyday
mundane identity and be someone else.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,757
ln college, l held a party

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,236
where everyone came as
their favourite Elizabethan poet.

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,032
l remember.

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,992
lt was so great,
l chose Christopher Marlowe.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,714
l was deeply into <i>Dr Faustus</i>
at the time.

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,197
But l still get letters
from people who loved it.

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,438
Say, didn't we used to have
a weekly Elizabethan Poet Night?

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,835
Yeah, started getting too rowdy.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,630
You were charged with practising
iambic pentameter without a licence.

70
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,238
Sam, if l'm to serve
both as a waitress

71
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,432
and the butt of jokes,
l should make more money.

72
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,233
What does a good butt make
in this town?

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,435
ln keeping with the spirit of
this establishment, and its patrons,

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,235
l suggest you get down in the mud
and throw a toga party.

75
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,033
A toga party?
Where they dress up in sheets?

76
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,755
l'm sure you'd love it.
lt's a stupid fraternity tradition.

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,838
A bunch of borderline humans
stand around

78
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,952
swilling beer
and vomiting on themselves,

79
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,038
until, inevitably,
they raise their robes

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,232
to reveal the depths
of their personalities.

81
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,828
Hallelujah, l am saved!

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,111
l can see it. This'll make that luau
look like a pig roast.

83
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,195
Easily.

84
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,153
Can l use Cheers?
l'll pay half what you ask.

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,034
- How can l pass that up?
- l got a lot to do here.

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,233
l should go home, close myself off
and work out all the details.

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,033
- Good luck.
- l can do it in the bathroom.

88
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,716
Sam.

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,477
- Are these people dressed in togas?
- No, Coach.

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,636
l thought it mean to be
a toga party.

91
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,432
lt is.

92
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,632
l'm getting my spells again.
l though l had 'em licked.

93
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,830
- No, you are right, Coach.
- Sure?

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,351
Yes. These people just haven't got
into the spirit of the party.

95
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,637
Oh, thanks.

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,036
Diane. The gang in the back
ready for another order?

97
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,195
Not yet.

98
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,790
lt's been an hour and a half.
Are they watching their ice melt?

99
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,638
Actually, it's quite peppy.

100
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,398
One fellow, believe or not,

101
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,114
can recite every area code
in the country.

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,038
We're talking dazzling entertainment.

103
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,435
Sam, can you spring me
for a few minutes? l gotta see this.

104
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,238
Enjoy, Coach.

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,113
lf this guy knows Laramie, Wyoming,
l'll croak.

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,075
Boy, this party stinks.

107
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,599
Well, maybe we should do something
to help pick it up.

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,030
l got an idea.
Why don't you go back to my office?

109
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,232
ln my desk you'll find two tassels
and a G-string.

110
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,078
l'll hum <i>Night Train...</i>

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,395
- Come on.
- Get out.

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,230
Let the games begin!

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,553
Holy...

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,670
Well, you all got the date right
so l know you can read.

115
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,030
How come you're not in a toga?

116
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,597
l was afraid everyone else would
chicken out and l'd look like a fool.

117
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,238
Good point.

118
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,235
Jensen, nice suit.

119
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,038
Hello, there.

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,033
Why did l volunteer? l'm a dead man.

121
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,829
Sammy, you got someone
lying in state in the back room?

122
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,999
Nobody's moved
for an hour and a half.

123
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,037
Normie, l like it. You look like
the Pillsbury Dough Monster.

124
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
- How come you're late?
- l had car trouble.

125
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,238
You try flagging down help
dressed like this.

126
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,153
Where's your wife?
Why isn't she at the party?

127
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,430
She didn't hear about it.

128
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,631
This is the worst party yet. Thanks
loads for the toga idea, Diane.

129
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,431
Well, Norman, all you need
is a little icebreaker. Let me help.

130
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,749
Everybody. How about a round of that
always enjoyable game, charades?

131
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,639
l'll start off.

132
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,031
Movie title.

133
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,869
Four words.

134
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,232
First word.

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,631
My. Sounds like eye.

136
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,639
l'll give you the first one,
get you going. OK, second word.

137
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,830
What am l doing here? Eating.

138
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,236
Doesn't this look like eating?
When do we eat and drink?

139
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,396
Dinner! <i>My Dinner...</i>

140
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,431
Third word.

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,312
What is this? lt's little, isn't it?
lt's a little word.

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,399
W. Begins with a W. Little word.
With! <i>My Dinner With...</i>

143
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,239
<i>My Dinner With Julius LaRosa!</i>

144
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,636
That's it.

145
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,277
- OK, Ogden, Utah.
- Eight zero one!

146
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
Hold it down, everybody,
it's the phone!

147
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,635
l feel it! l feel that beat!

148
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,833
Get up off your seat
and on your feet. lt's limbo time.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,230
Come on, everybody!

150
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,357
Come on now.

151
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,635
Last year, you ate a pig
with your fists. What's going on?

152
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,232
Come on!

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,998
Pack of nerds.

154
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,314
Norm, that was a message for you.

155
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,238
Somebody named Ruta
can't make it tonight.

156
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,716
Ruta's the girl l had coming
to entertain the big boss.

157
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,557
This can't be happening.

158
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,274
First, l throw the worst party
in history,

159
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,436
now l got no date for the big boss.

160
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,949
You've got to set your boss up
with a woman?

161
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,355
Yeah, it's the party director's duty.

162
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,838
Why not ask one of the women here?
Or does your boss like live things?

163
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,031
- Carla, do you suppose...?
- No, Norm. Don't look at me.

164
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,833
l got four kids.
l'm not looking for more.

165
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,431
- You needn't have sex with him.
- Doesn't matter. l'm a fast breeder.

166
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,433
A man winks at me
and l'm three months along.

167
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,030
l need a woman!

168
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,235
Does anybody need anything?

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,231
Hallelujah!

170
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,836
Let me see if l've got this straight?

171
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,431
You want me to
entertain a man l've never met.

172
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,949
Pour him a few drinks
and chat with him.

173
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,116
You don't have to go home with him.

174
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
Though if you do, l'll drive.

175
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,592
l'm joking around.

176
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,635
l'm going to walk away and pretend
that you never asked me to do this.

177
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,834
This could work out for you, too.
You might like this guy.

178
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,032
He's intelligent.
He went to Harvard Business School.

179
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,832
Sam?

180
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,839
l can't believe your job depends
on you finding this guy a woman.

181
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,157
That's right.
lt's demeaning and dehumanising,

182
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,111
not just to me but to yourself.

183
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,629
l get it.
You think l'm a kissy, right?

184
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,551
lt's easy for you two to talk.
Diane's attractive, she's got brains.

185
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,353
Sammy, good-looking, a baseball star.

186
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,630
l've got nothing. My only hope is

187
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,991
to find someone with something
and make them like me.

188
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,839
- Norm...
- So if there are boots to be licked,

189
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,839
apples to be polished and
fannies to be kissed, l'll be there.

190
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,036
First time l saw a man
strut and grovel at the same time.

191
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,473
You know, Norm is
kind of in a jam here tonight.

192
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,515
- Now you want me to do this.
- lt wouldn't be so bad, would it?

193
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,030
- You're asking me to do this.
- What's the big deal?

194
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,199
You sit down with some old guy,
you have a drink, he'll fall asleep.

195
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,788
Hello, Mr Sawyer, sir. Welcome.

196
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,435
Well, Norman's a friend.

197
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,639
l guess l could give the old geezer
a couple of minutes of my time.

198
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,836
We are all honoured and thrilled
that you could make it.

199
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,838
- l like your sheet.
- This old thing?

200
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,033
Come on down here,
l'll show you a seat.

201
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,958
Why don't you let me do that?
l know the place.

202
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,640
l'll never forget this, Diane.

203
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,796
Mr Sawyer, Diane Chambers.

204
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,639
- Nice to meet you, Diane.
- Nice to meet you.

205
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,035
Why don't you two sit right here?
You!

206
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,035
Well, what would you like to drink?

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,196
Scotch rocks.

208
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,232
Barkeep, a little service, please.

209
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,435
Mr Sawyer will have Scotch rocks.
Let's see, what am l in the mood for?

210
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,152
How about a good beating?

211
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,950
- Perhaps a vermouth cassis.
- Fine.

212
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,232
lf you need anything else, just
snap your fingers. ln several places.

213
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,710
l guess working in a bar
makes you grumpy.

214
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,433
Good evening! We're Eddie Barnett
and the Eddie Barnetters.

215
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,233
OK, it's request time. Shout 'em out.

216
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,833
<i>Chicago?</i>

217
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,838
One of Eddie's favourites. <i>Chicago.</i>

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,030
Norm, this band is the worst.

219
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,119
l don't understand it.
They sounded so good over the phone.

220
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,231
- So you're an art student?
- Yes.

221
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,157
l always wanted to be a painter.

222
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,955
l must say, it is so refreshing
to meet someone like you.

223
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,038
Someone in business
who enjoys the finer things.

224
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,435
Here you go. One for you.

225
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,630
One for your lady of the evening.

226
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,629
- To a sparkling conversationalist.
- Thank you.

227
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,429
l'd normally ask you to go out
and find some place to talk,

228
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,439
but l don't think we'd find
any place as quiet as this.

229
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,635
- Something wrong with your drink?
- Yes.

230
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,354
- l'll take it back.
- No, l know the bartender.

231
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,630
- You sure?
- Yes, l'll be right back.

232
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,353
- Do you have a problem, Mr Malone?
- Listen, you're a light drinker.

233
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,711
Don't get carried away
and do something you'll regret.

234
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,430
You're not bothered
that l'm spending time with Herb?

235
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,312
Herb?

236
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,432
No. None of my business, really.

237
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,438
Looks a little seamy
but seaminess has its place.

238
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,275
A moment ago
you were encouraging it.

239
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,755
A moment ago, he was 85 years old.

240
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,235
l see. An old man is fine,

241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,158
but one whose kidneys
are functioning is taboo.

242
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,033
Look, like l said,
it's none of my business,

243
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,631
but he expects you to be his for the
whole evening. Know what l mean?

244
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,390
Sam, we are having
a harmless conversation about art.

245
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,238
- You know what l think?
- What?

246
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,591
l think you're bothered
that he's so good-looking.

247
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,756
You call that good-looking?
He's got padded shoulders

248
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,440
and l bet that's not even
his real lips.

249
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,638
- He's gorgeous. lt drives you crazy.
- No.

250
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,230
lt kills you that there's
another attractive man in your bar.

251
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,635
Another rooster in your henhouse.

252
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,631
My days are much easier now we've got
those Cup-a-Soups in the office.

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,558
lf that was your idea, Mr Sawyer,
you are a genius.

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,035
Norm, how about l buy you a drink?

255
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,039
Why don't you set sail for the bar
and have yourself a good time?

256
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,639
That's wonderful, sir.

257
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,548
l understand there's a pool table
in the back. How about a game?

258
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,515
OK. l've never played before,
but why should that stop us?

259
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,189
Thank you for that conversation, sir.
l'm the better for it.

260
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,830
- Hi, there.
- Hello.

261
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,436
That is a good-looking guy.

262
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,075
l felt something kick.

263
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,353
Now you know
why l never go to these things.

264
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,438
lt's strange,
getting that reaction from people.

265
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,597
l like to think it's the money
and position, not me.

266
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,790
l can assure you, it's not you.

267
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,475
l think Sawyer likes Diane.
l'm on my way, big guy.

268
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,830
You're really sickening tonight.

269
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,233
l know, Sam. l'm not proud of myself.

270
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,237
But then, l never am.

271
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,039
Well, Simon Says is my game.
l'm great at that.

272
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,756
Maybe l can help you out. l can teach
you to play in a couple of minutes.

273
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,953
Just put your left hand down,
like that.

274
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,232
- Grab the end with your other hand.
- l'm not in the way, am l?

275
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,638
- You smell wonderful. What is it?
- Thank you. Dandruff shampoo.

276
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,635
- l like it.
- l don't flake for hours.

277
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,638
- Herb, wait a minute.
- Diane, you're beautiful.

278
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,275
You know, l don't believe in
mauling on the first date.

279
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,234
- l didn't come to hear the band.
- We were having a nice conversation.

280
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,636
- That part's over.
- How is everything back here?

281
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,910
- Norman!
- He'll stop in a minute.

282
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,156
- No, really.
- Mr Sawyer, sir...

283
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,236
- Get lost, Norm.
- Fine, sir.

284
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,753
- This is not my idea of romance.
- Come on.

285
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,632
- Wait.
- l told you to leave.

286
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,273
Mr Sawyer!

287
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,233
- This is a big mistake.
- Sorry, sir. l know, sir.

288
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,998
Nice cologne, sir.

289
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,635
You're crazy. You set me up
with this girl and then do this?

290
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,719
There's no room in my company
for unstable people.

291
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,038
- Clean out your desk. You're fired!
- l figured.

292
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,837
Norman, l'm real sorry
you lost your job.

293
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,032
- That's what l was trying to avoid.
- lt's alright.

294
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,038
What was that about?
Your boss just stormed out.

295
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,355
- He's not my boss any more.
- What?

296
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,438
He was all over Diane.
l had to get rough with him.

297
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,718
l want a beer.

298
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,036
- You OK?
- Yes.

299
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,032
Well, go ahead. Gloat.

300
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,834
Believe it or not,
l'm really sorry this happened.

301
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,430
l know you must be feeling
hurt and angry right now.

302
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,834
No.

303
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,033
l'm not feeling hurt and angry.
l brought this on myself.

304
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,314
- Actually, l feel kind of...
- Cheap?

305
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,239
Alright, yes, l feel cheap.

306
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,836
l saw an attractive person,
a little glamour,

307
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,431
and l wanted to meet him so badly
that l threw myself at him.

308
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,517
Totally sacrificing
my dignity and pride.

309
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,234
What's wrong with that?
l do that all the time.

310
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,430
For one terrible moment
l saw myself through his eyes.

311
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,114
l saw nothing but a... cheap harlot.

312
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,236
Come on. We all know
that you'd starve to death

313
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,033
before you made a living
with your body.

314
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,438
- Thanks, Sam.
- You're welcome, Diane.

315
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,910
So he fired you, Norm?

316
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,829
Fired me, Coach.

317
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,350
You know something?

318
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,029
l may not have a job.
l may not have a future.

319
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,835
l may not have anything
except this sheet on my back.

320
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,876
But you know something?

321
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,638
l feel terrible.

322
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,352
Gee, l'm sorry, Norm.

323
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,914
- Did you really hit the boss?
- No, l just shoved him around a bit.

324
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,431
Everybody, it's true.
Norman just punched out the boss.

325
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,870
- l just pushed him around.
- Way to go, Peterson.

326
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,036
Alright, Norman!

327
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,430
Norman, our hero!

328
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,435
