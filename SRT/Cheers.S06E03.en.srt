00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,100
          Oh, my God.           
         Hey, hey, hey.

144
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
        ( <i>bell ringing,</i>         
     <i>people cheering</i> )

145
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
     Get over here, Eddie!

146
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,100
                    ( <i>whistles</i> )

147
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
What's going on?

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,100
                 Oh, great news,
                 Miss Howe.

149
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
                Carla's marrying
                Eddie LeBec.

150
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,700
Oh, that cute little guy        
with the dents in his nose.

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey, listen up, everybody.

152
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Wait, wait, wait,               
here we go.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
    Here we go, here we go.

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
I want                          
to be making a toast

155
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,000
                 to my beautiful
                 bride-to-be.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Listen, you know,               
I don't make my living

157
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,400
using words, so this            
is gonna be kind of hard

158
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,800
            for me, okay,       
            but here it goes.

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,200
                    Uh, Carla...

160
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,800
                 Well, you know.

161
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,900
              ALL:              
        Well, you know.

162
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,400
Yeah.

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
            I love you, sweetie.

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,700
Hey, congratulations, man.      
    This is terrific.

165
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
                    Thanks.

166
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,000
     Are you gonna take her     
        on a honeymoon?

167
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,800
Hey, got any suggestions?       
                        Yeah.

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
                    New Orleans.

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
        I found a great         
     little honeymoon spot

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,700
    just kind of tucked away    
      off Bourbon Street.

171
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,800
Great food, very romantic,      
  steamy atmosphere, you know.

172
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,000
                Yeah, I had the 
                time of my life,

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,200
 and then Vera tracked me down.

174
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,900
  Well, if I get any time off   
      from training camp,

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
      I thought maybe Carla     
      might like to see Waikiki.

176
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,600
Waikiki...                      
Honolulu, Hawaii?

177
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
    Sure, we'll hit them all.

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,700
    Yeah, right!

179
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
          I only hope           
    I can get some time off

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
    from the Howitzer.

181
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,700
Sorry. <i>Miss</i> Howitzer.

182
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
                Time off?

183
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,000
      Well, you'll be having    
      all the time in the world.

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
        You think I'd be        
        having a wife of mine

185
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,700
                work in a crummy
                bar like this?

186
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,100
      No offense, Miss Howitzer.

187
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
        It's Miss Howe.

188
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,300
    Oh, take it easy.

189
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,700
They're just complimenting      
         your big guns.

190
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,100
Wait a minute.

191
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,600
Y-You're telling me

192
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,600
that I don't have               
to work anymore?

193
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,000
You mean, I can just            
sit around the house all day,

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
eating peanut butter            
out of a jar,

195
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,000
and watching                    
my toenails grow?

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,900
 She's, uh, quite a catch, Ed.

197
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
         Boy, you know,         
I'm gonna miss you around here.

198
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,300
    Oh, Sammy, I'll drop by     
        once in a while

199
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,800
to watch all you 9-to-5'ers

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,900
spill drinks                    
on your butler suits.

201
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,500
So, when's                      
the big day, Carla?

202
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, I'd like to do it         
as soon as possible

203
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
before my little hunk           
of back bacon here

204
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,700
changes his mind.

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
             Ah, no way, I'm not
             one of those flakes

206
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
        you used to go out with.

207
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,100
             Oh, but listen, we 
             have to get married

208
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,200
                on a day with   
                a two in it

209
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
                'cause two's    
                my lucky number.

210
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Rats. Mine's three.

211
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
                Oh, no sweat.

212
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
    Lucky two, lucky three...

213
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,900
        We can get married on   
        the 23rd or the 32nd.

214
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,300
      That's right, honey.

215
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
            Oh, right, right.

216
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,400
                    No, um...

217
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,900
             As long as it's not
             on a Wednesday.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,300
      Ooh, yeah, bad juju.

219
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,900
                        Yeah.

220
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,700
      This is going to be       
    an interesting wedding--

221
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,100
the two most superstitious      
      people in the world.

222
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,700
Hey, hey, don't say that,       
it's bad luck.

223
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,500
    Listen, whatever you do,    
don't make any plans afterwards

224
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
'cause we're going to throw you 
 the biggest wedding reception

225
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,400
in history right here...

226
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,800
                    Oh, great!  
          ( <i>applause</i> )

227
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,700
    ( <i>clears throat</i> )

228
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,800
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

229
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,700
        Force of habit.

230
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,000
    Not my place to do that.    
        I'm sorry.

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,100
 Ms. Howe's going to throw you  
the biggest wedding reception...

232
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
          ( <i>cheering</i> )

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
I need to talk to you           
right now.

234
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,500
          Uh, wait...

235
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,700
before you say anything,        
let me just, uh...

236
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,900
I had an idea.

237
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,700
Why don't you                   
invite your boss,

238
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,400
what's-his-name,                
Evan Drake.

239
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
You know,                       
he's a sports fan, so I hear.

240
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,400
Maybe he'd enjoy                
meeting Eddie LeBec there.

241
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,300
You know, you could             
throw him a big bash,

242
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,700
impress the pants off him.

243
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,400
What were you                   
going to say?

244
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,400
             I was going to tell
             you to smile more.

245
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
    Mm-hmm.

246
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,300
            I didn't say smugly.

247
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
        Excuse me,              
  I have a phone call to make.

248
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,900
      Hey there, Eduardo,

249
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,400
looks like you and Carla aren't 
  the only lovebirds in town.

250
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
        Check out DeeDee        
        and David there.

251
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,700
    Who?

252
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,200
  DeeDee and David Lefsowski,

253
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,000
      the <i>Weekly Gabbers'</i>       
    <i>odd couple of the month.</i>

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,300
    See, she weighs in there    
         at 480 pounds,

255
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,200
     and he tips the scales     
    at a mere, uh, 92.

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,100
     But I mean, just look      
    at the love in his eyes.

257
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,900
  I think that's fear, Cliff.

258
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Cute baby he's holding.

259
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,700
     That's her arm, Woody.

260
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,000
Cute arm he's holding.

261
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,500
Hey. Picked a date yet?

262
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
                    Yep.

263
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,400
        Eddie wants to do it    
        a week from Saturday,

264
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
        anytime before 4:00 p.m.

265
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
                which is okay   
                with my psychic,

266
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,400
     as long as our auras remain
     in the blue spectrum,

267
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,400
                  and there's no
                  solar eclipse.

268
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,300
It's really tough               
planning a wedding, isn't it?

269
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,100
          Ooh, tell me about it.

270
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,200
              You know, I'm just
              a little nervous

271
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,300
    about waiting eight days.

272
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,000
                 Gives Eddie an 
                 awful long time

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
          to come to his senses.

274
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,900
Look at him.

275
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,600
             He's absorbed in   
             thought over there.

276
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,300
                Well, maybe not.

277
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,800
        There.

278
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,100
The table looks nice.

279
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,000
Woody, don't you think          
the table looks nice?

280
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I think it looks nice.

281
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,200
                     Looks nice.

282
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
You think so?

283
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,300
Oh, damn,                       
I bet chucklebrain

284
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,900
forgot to pick up               
the napkins.

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,700
      Oh, no, Sam didn't forget.

286
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,900
  Eddie brought these special   
  wedding ones they had made up.

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,300
"We don't want                  
to get married.

288
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,400
We have to. Ha, ha."

289
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
        Cute.

290
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,900
                You see the     
                little hillbilly

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,100
            with the shotgun?

292
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,700
Yes, he's nice, isn't he?

293
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,900
But I think these are           
just a little too funny

294
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,300
for the reception.

295
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,600
    Burn them.

296
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,800
    Did you remember to get     
the cinnamon almond decaf?

297
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
          Yeah, I did.

298
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
        Who likes that?

299
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
        Evan does.

300
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,200
         Everyone does.

301
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,400
     Excuse me, Miss Howe,

302
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,500
        I know it's none        
     of my beeswax, but...

303
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
          it seems to me like   
          you're awfully nervous

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
                about Mr. Drake 
                coming by today.

305
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,300
                 Do you like him
                 or something?

306
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
In a business sense, yes.

307
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,300
I admire his skills             
and accomplishments.

308
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,100
                You like him.

309
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,200
                         Boys...

310
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
        we're all set up        
      with my buddy Bruce.

311
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,900
     He can get us the same     
     silverware Carla picked out

312
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
    from the Filene's catalog   
    for over two-thirds off.

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
Oh, yeah.

314
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,100
So what's the bite-ski?

315
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
        20 bucks apiece.

316
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
I'll catch you guys later.

317
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
                Say, Norm, there
                isn't any chance

318
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,100
        that this stuff         
is stolen merchandise, is there?

319
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
    No, of course not.

320
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Listen, if anyone asks,

321
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,100
    we never heard of Bruce,    
we can't find the receipt,

322
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,900
     and if you run into me     
    up on the street,

323
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,200
         call me Larry.

324
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,200
              My mind's at ease.

325
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
        So, Sam, what are you   
        concocting there?

326
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,100
You know how superstitious      
Carla and Eddie are.

327
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
I thought I'd mix them          
up a batch

328
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,800
of my good-luck                 
wedding punch.

329
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,100
It never fails.

330
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
             Isn't that the same
             stuff you made

331
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
                 when you were  
                 getting married

332
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
            to Miss Chambers?

333
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
Woody, you want to flush this   
down the toilet.

334
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,500
        Hi, guys.

335
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,100
                        Hey.    
                    Hey.

336
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,200
Carla, what are you doing       
here on your wedding day?

337
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,400
      Oh, oh, actually I came by
      to get my last paycheck.

338
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,900
            See, the bridal shop
            has this policy

339
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,100
     about their wedding gowns--

340
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
    "Fork over the jack,        
    or it stays on the rack."

341
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,400
                 So where is it?

342
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,100
Oh, I'm so sorry

343
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,700
that I don't have it ready      
for you right this very second.

344
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,400
I guess                         
I've just been busy

345
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,900
putting up                      
every single decoration

346
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,500
and ordering                    
all the hors d'oeuvres

347
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,900
and getting a band together     
at the very last minute

348
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,300
so that your reception          
could be just perfect for you.

349
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,000
        Could you step on it?   
        I'm in a hurry.

350
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,400
    Soda, bartender.

351
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,700
                Coming right up.

352
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,400
              So how's the bride
              on her big day?

353
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,900
Couldn't be better, Sammy.

354
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,300
      All celestial omens       
         are favorable.

355
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,300
 Seems that Eddie and I picked  
    the one day this century

356
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,500
      when all the planets      
    and constellations

357
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
are in perfect alignment.

358
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,600
    So either we get married    
         by 4:00 today,

359
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,900
        or we wait              
      until the year 2042.

360
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
              I don't know, call
              me old-fashioned,

361
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,300
        but I still think you   
        ought to get married

362
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,600
          before your baby does.

363
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,400
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )

364
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,900
         How'd you manage to    
         swing a church wedding?

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
            You know, being     
            divorced and all.

366
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,400
Don't you remember?

367
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,100
I had my marriage to Nick       
      annulled years ago.

368
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,300
Oh, right, right,               
right, right. Took forever.

369
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,400
                        Mm-hmm.

370
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,900
                  But things got
                  speeded up

371
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
    when Nick tried to sell     
     the Bishop his watch.

372
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,800
Oh, hey,                        
isn't that Eddie LeBec

373
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,600
            sashaying down those
            stairs, there, Doc?

374
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
             Sure looks like it.
But Carla's here.

375
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,200
Isn't there                     
some superstition

376
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,400
about the groom seeing the bride
before the wedding?

377
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,600
          ( <i>screams</i> )

378
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,400
        ( <i>screams</i> )

379
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,700
                Nobody believes 
                in that anymore.

380
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,300
                     You saw me.

381
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,000
        I saw you.

382
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,800
    I saw you see me.

383
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
I saw you see me see you.

384
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
        Oh...                   
                Shut up.

385
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,100
You're making it worse.

386
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,900
                     Oh, my God.

387
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
    We were so careful          
    about every single thing,

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
                and then we blew

389
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,000
    the single most important   
    superstition of all--

390
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,500
         seeing the bride on    
         the day of the wedding.

391
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,800
                    What are you
                    doing here?

392
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
    I was meeting my mother.    
    What are you doing here?

393
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,200
      I came by to get my check!

394
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,900
                      That's it.

395
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,700
                 We've blown it.

396
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,900
                    We can't get
                    married now.

397
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
        Call me in 2042.

398
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,300
    Yeah, okay. I'll see ya.

399
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
     You guys are kidding.

400
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,500
        Come on. Eddie.

401
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,600
         Wait a minute.         
        What am I doing?

402
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
            Carla...

403
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Look, I don't want              
to give up the best thing

404
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,800
that ever happened to me.

405
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,100
         Oh, come off it, Eddie.

406
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,500
          You're just as        
          superstitious as I am.

407
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Well, not anymore.

408
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,200
And I'm going                   
to prove to you

409
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
there's nothing                 
to all that mumbo jumbo.

410
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Woody, hand me a mirror.

411
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,700
              Huh?

412
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
You know, the one Sam's         
always looking at himself in.

413
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
                    What are you
                    going to do?

414
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm going to break it.

415
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,300
            The bad luck is     
            starting already.

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,500
             He's lost his mind.

     Hey, that's my mirror.

419
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,600
You see? Nothing.

420
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,900
The ground didn't open up       
and swallow me.

421
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
        That's because they want
        you out in the open

                 can get you.

423

Don't do that!

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,400
Oh!

425
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,900
    Which shoulder do you throw 
    salt over to avoid bad luck?

426
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,100
The left, the left.

427
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
No! No, no!

Don't, don't...

    Come on.

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
             Hello.

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,700
     Oh, hi, Dr. Nadelson.

440
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,400
How did my tests come out?

441
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You've got to be kidding.

442
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,800
What? What is it?

                 having twins.

446
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,800
I told you something            
horrible was going to happen.

447
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
What is so bad?

448
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,900
Twins means                     
we're twice blessed.

449
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,100
Yeah, I had twins once.

450
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,900
It was the happiest             
day of my life.

Listen, Carla,                  
you and me, we can...

458
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
we can overcome                 
any obstacles

459
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,800
that are in our way.

460
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,700
      You're a great guy, Eddie.

465
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,100
        You see? I knew         
        things would look up.

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
                What's wrong?

469
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
It's just that, hey,            
when you called

470
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,800
about getting remarried,

471
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
I realized                      
how much I love you.

472
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,800
I just wanted to be             
with you on this day.

473
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
                    And?

474
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,500
    Uh, and Dad's TV shop--     
         it went under.

475
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
We got evicted,                 
and I can't get unemployment

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
'cause Daddy didn't declare me  
an employee.

477
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,900
             Well, I'm just glad

478
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,800
            my little boy's     
            here for my wedding.

479
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,300
  What about his lovely wife?

480
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,200
      I'm just glad my little   
      boy's here for my wedding.

481
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,100
Actually,                       
Mother Tortelli,

482
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,400
we didn't want                  
to return to Vegas.

483
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,700
We don't think                  
it's any place

484
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,100
for children                    
to grow up.

485
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,200
      You're having a kid?

486
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
I'm talking about us.

487
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,500
So, if we could find            
someone here in Boston

488
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
with an nice house

489
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,900
and lots of extra room...

490
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Do you know anyone              
like that, Mother Tortelli?

491
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,100
          No, no, no.

492
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
  You don't want to come live

493
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,100
      in my little, tiny,       
      overcrowded house.

494
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,500
        Ma, it's just temporary.

495
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
                Just till I get 
                back on my feet.

496
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,200
         Hey, if it's a problem,

497
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,400
            we'll find someplace
            else to stay.

498
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Yeah. I think I saw

499
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,700
a nice cardboard box            
in the alley.

500
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
        See, see?               
      What did I tell ya?

501
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,700
      This is the bad luck      
  I've been warning you about.

502
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,700
                 Carla, don't   
                 worry about it.

503
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,800
                I mean, the more
                the merrier.

504
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
          Look, I'm going to get

505
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,300
             a major salary bump
             this season,

506
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,900
    and then I'll buy us all    
    the biggest house in Boston.

507
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,600
Wow. A new house?

508
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,900
                    You bet.

509
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
                 Now do you     
                 finally believe

510
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,700
             that nothing bad   
             is going to happen?

511
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
No. I'll just have              
more closet space

512
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,700
when it does.

513
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,400
Anthony, I'm Eddie LeBec.

514
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
                I guess I'm your
                new stepfather.

515
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,000
        I'm hoping one day      
        you'll call me "Dad."

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,700
Hey, Nick Tortelli              
is my dad.

517
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,900
You are not my father,

518
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,100
and you never will be!

519
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,700
            Anthony!

520
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,800
You only knocked up my ma

521
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,100
so she'd have to marry you.

522
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,400
         Ma, I'm sorry.         
The guy was asking for it.

523
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,500
Come on, Annie,                 
let's go.

524
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
Forgive him.

525
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,400
He has the hot passion          
of his race,

526
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,000
and I have the envy             
of every woman I know.

527
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,400
            Well, this is it.

528
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
        This is the bad luck.

529
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,800
                  I mean, what  
                  could be worse

530
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
              than my kid hating
              my husband?

531
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,500
Look, it's okay.

532
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
He's just a kid.

533
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,500
                  Oh, you don't 
                  get it, Eddie.

534
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
                 He's the nicest
                 one I got.

535
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,000
Look, Carla, he's just          
being protective of his mother.

536
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,000
God knows                       
that I think my <i>maman's</i>

537
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
the greatest woman              
on Earth.

538
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,700
And I can only hope             
that our kids feel the same way.

539
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,100
    Are you from this planet?

540
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Carla, here's your              
final paycheck.

541
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
    Thank...

542
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,000
    I might say that you have   
    been a unique employee,

543
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
            and it's going to   
            be very difficult

544
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,700
        to fill your uniform.

545
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,900
    Thanks.

546
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,300
        You don't happen to know

547
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,500
    any other short, pregnant   
    cocktail waitresses, do you?

548
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,500
     Yeah, can I help you?

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100

 <i>Non, non, Maman.</i>

563
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,400
                 No, no, no, no.

567
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,000
             Carla.

568
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,700
                    I'm so happy
                    to meet you.

569
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
         <i>Non. Non.</i>

570
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,700
             <i>Je ne permettrai</i>   
             <i>jamais mon fils</i>

571
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,900
 <i>à marier ce petit souris</i>

572
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
      <i>avec le grand ventre.</i>

573
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,100
     <i>Maman... Maman...</i>          
 <i>Je ne permettrai ce mariage...</i>

574
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,800
 <i>noon, avec le...</i>               
                     <i>Maman.</i>

575
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 <i>O, mon Dieu!</i>

576
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,100
She says she has to catch a bus.

577
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,700
             <i>Maman!</i>

578
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
    I get the feeling           
she wasn't nuts about me.

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,900
What'd she say?

580
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,600
                 What makes you 
                 think I'd know?

581
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,900
'Cause all you pompous          
windbags speak French.

582
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,300
        She said she'll never   
        allow this marriage.

583
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,000
                 Especially to a
                 pregnant hussy

584
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
            who's only trying   
            to trap her son.

585
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,100
      Then she said she'd rather
      be dragged around town

586
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
                by her tongue...

587
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,700
          or else she called you
          a small grapefruit.

588
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,000
  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,   
         wait a minute.

589
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,900
        Before you say anything,

590
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,100
                I know what your
                mother said.

591
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,600
                  And it doesn't
                  matter to me.

592
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,000
    You finally convinced me    
    that our love can conquer

593
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,400
            any bad luck that   
            comes our way.

594
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,600
                      I mean it.

595
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,200
            Anthony and Annie   
            moving in,

596
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,600
              your ma hating me,

597
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
                  Anthony hating
                  you, twins...

598
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,100
         Every time one of these

599
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,500
                 little piddling
                 things came up,

600
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
                 I kept thinking

601
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,600
        you were going to say   
        the wedding's off.

602
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,700
The wedding's off.

603
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,900
        Yeah, that's what I kept

604
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,100
        expecting you to say.

605
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,000
The wedding's off.

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
                 Yeah, yeah,    
                 we're all clear

607
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
            on what I thought   
            you'd say.

608
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,600
The wedding's off.

609
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
     But you never said it.
