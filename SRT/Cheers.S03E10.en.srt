1
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,335
I'm looking for Sam Malone,
the ex-Red Sox player.

2
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:17,663
Over there behind the bar.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,296
- Boy, has he gotten old.
- No, son, I'm Sam Malone.

4
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,878
I know.

5
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,392
Your mother knows
you hang around in bars?

6
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:33,811
My brother, Doug,
is the biggest Red Sox fan ever.

7
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,686
He's in hospital having
his tonsils out.

8
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:40,062
It would mean a lot
if he could have an autograph.

9
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:42,645
- Sure thing.
- Here you go.

10
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:47,781
Not yours. I figured you'd know
where to find Carl Yastrzemski.

11
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:50,361
No, but I'll start you on your way.

12
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,579
Sam, hold it.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,741
Just kidding. Here's your ball.
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,435
We don't keep in touch.

15
00:00:57,587 --> 00:01:01,502
Doug will be disappointed.
I don't know what to do.

16
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,344
Could you sign it?
It's almost as good.

17
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,880
You sure your brother won't mind?

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,220
Yeah. He doesn't know what
Yastrzemski's handwriting looks like.

19
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,144
Good point.

20
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:34,096
OK, cut the crap.
Today's my birthday.

21
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,744
You all know that.

22
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,391
If you're planning a party for me,
and you better be,

23
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,602
let's get the show on the road.

24
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:44,892
If that's not a cue for
merriment, what is?

25
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,737
Just a small token
of my appreciation.

26
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:50,311
A very small token.

27
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,823
Good things come in small packages.

28
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:59,449
Little things come in small packages.
Perfume.

29
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,328
No, toilet water.

30
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,254
Gag gift, I went for it. OK.

31
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,673
All right, Carla.

32
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:23,393
- Maybe this will make it up to you.
- Now, this is more like it. All right.

33
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,989
A jelly bean.

34
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:44,579
Thank you, Norm. Another gag gift.
You guys are too much.

35
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:49,911
And garlic flavoured.
Nice touch, Norm.

36
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,128
All right. Come on, stop.

37
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,344
You know how these clowns
have to get their gags in.

38
00:03:56,512 --> 00:04:00,177
We saved the best for last.
This is from me and from Coach.

39
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,309
Silverware.

40
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,189
- Lone Ranger?
- You wear it to ride on Silver.

41
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,325
Don't you get it, Carla?
You wear it to ride on Silver.

42
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:30,121
- Silverware.
- Hilarious. Thanks a bunch, guys.

43
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:32,537
Don't thank us, it's the thought.

44
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,374
Can we throw a party or what?

45
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:43,760
- There he is.
- Can't we put this off till tomorrow?

46
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:47,137
It's such a lovely evening.
Let's not despoil it.

47
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:52,388
You only inflame violent emotional
confrontations by putting them off.

48
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,398
Your intelligence inflames me.

49
00:04:56,571 --> 00:05:01,114
Really? Well, e = mc squared.

50
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,822
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

51
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:08,036
Baby!

52
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,206
How about a couple of brandies?

53
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:15,379
Where were you?
You missed Carla's party.

54
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,415
We discovered this
French-Japanese restaurant.

55
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:21,633
Very chic, dark, romantic.

56
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:24,176
Be careful about unlighted joints.

57
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,515
You don't know
what grubby food they'll slip you.

58
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,677
Not Chez Fujimoto.

59
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:36,062
Sam, Frasier and I
have something important to tell you.

60
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,274
Sam, this may be rough going.

61
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:42,028
Despite your vehement protests
to the contrary,

62
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,986
and without disparaging
your sincerity,

63
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,575
we believe you're suffering
some emotional residue

64
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:51,498
from your relationship with Diane.

65
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:56,791
I'm sorry, Frasier, I must have
dozed off for a paragraph or two.

66
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:59,003
What was he saying?

67
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:02,708
We came to
an important decision tonight.

68
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:07,179
Sam, brace yourself.
Diane and I are going to cohabitate.

69
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,914
Right here in the bar?

70
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,998
I guess it's cheaper
than a piano player.

71
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,475
This is predictable.
Making jokes to mask the pain.

72
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,320
I don't understand.

73
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm moving into Frasier's
fashionable townhouse.

74
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,114
Where's Frasier moving to?

75
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:31,161
You're being deliberately opaque...

76
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,284
Frasier, he's making a joke.

77
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,783
Shoot.

78
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:41,912
You two will be shacked up together?

79
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,130
Yes, I decided it was time.

80
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:48,678
What spoiled an evening with Diane
was having to say good night.

81
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:52,679
Really?
That was one of my highlights.

82
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,890
We know how much this hurts you,

83
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,896
but your defensiveness is annoying.

84
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:01,564
I don't know what you
expected me to do when you told me,

85
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:05,435
but this doesn't bother me.
I am very happy for you kids.

86
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:08,697
Thank you, Sam.
We couldn't be happier.

87
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:14,536
The only thing standing in the way of a
total commitment is Pavlov's response.

88
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:17,659
You see, that's my little joke, Sam.

89
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:22,294
Pavlov is my dog, you see,
and I couldn't resist the witticism.

90
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:26,377
- Let me explain. Pavlov...
- I know all about Pavlov.

91
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,002
Drooling at the sound
of a dinner bell.

92
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:33,714
I've done that before,
but I never knew what to call it.

93
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:39,060
I had a puppy once.
My ex-wife took her.

94
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:42,205
Little bitch. About this high.

95
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:47,271
Frasier,
we left Carla's present in the car.

96
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:50,363
I'll get it.
I hope I remember where I parked.

97
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:53,533
I'm inebriated with joy
over this situation.

98
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:56,537
Or else the sake made me crocky.

99
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:00,704
Nobody told me he was funny.

100
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,915
Now you know why.

101
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:08,547
It's pretty exciting news.

102
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:13,378
- Yes, we felt it was time.
- I wish you all the luck in the world.

103
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,888
Because we'll need it?

104
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:22,436
You're a pair made in heaven.
I don't care what the sceptics say,

105
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:27,232
I say the two of you will last...
Let's see, what time is it now?

106
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,697
Sam, you're hurting now, aren't you?
Admit it.

107
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:38,408
It's not surprising that you're bitter.
I never took this step with you,

108
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:42,826
but what Frasier and I have together
is more substantial.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,243
What you and I had was exciting,
tempestuous at times,

110
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:50,664
but there was no future in it.

111
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:54,625
You've got to be careful
about that excitement stuff.

112
00:08:54,803 --> 00:09:00,805
Too much of that and soon you're
starting to expect life to be enjoyable.

113
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:05,602
Then one day you wake up and all
those years of pleasure have gone by

114
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,892
and what have you got to show for it?
Happiness.

115
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,109
How true.

116
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:16,984
Here it is.
Where's our birthday girl?

117
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,696
In the back.
She'll be out in a minute.

118
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,909
Sam, would you call her?

119
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,780
I've lots to do.
I want to start moving my clothes in.

120
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,414
Do you have enough closet space?

121
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,745
Loads. Don't worry about that.

122
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:34,041
Frasier and Diane here
have a gift for you.

123
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:38,166
- Be still, my heart.
- Many happy returns, Carla.

124
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:42,178
- Beautiful wrapping.
- Yes, Coach, exquisite wrapping.

125
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,556
Now, let's get to the joke.

126
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:55,854
- Diane, these are beautiful.
- Frasier picked them out.

127
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,938
Thank you.

128
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:02,195
- How about vino to break them in?
- Yeah, I want to make a toast.

129
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:07,992
I want to toast the two people who had
enough class to get me a real gift.

130
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,084
To Diane and Frasier.

131
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:28,139
No matter how many times I give
fine-dribble crystal, I never tire of it.

132
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,150
So how's it going, Carla?

133
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:45,609
Fine. But don't think I don't appreciate
busy guys like you caring enough to ask.

134
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:51,911
She's still sore about the gag gifts.

135
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:56,082
She's more than sore.
She's hurt, offended and resentful.

136
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,418
If she were wearing dirty bunny
slippers, she could be Vera.

137
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:08,221
It's our fault.
We could have got her something nice.

138
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,718
It's not too late.
We can still give her a surprise.

139
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,374
Just buy her a real gift.

140
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:16,227
Well, I'm a knowledgeable shopper.

141
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,519
I'll take charge of
Operation Make-Good.

142
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:22,376
We sure we want Cliff
to handle this?

143
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:25,223
He's likely to buy
something tasteless.

144
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:28,617
Yeah, but none of us
will know the difference.

145
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,697
Cliffie, you're our man.

146
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,996
Afternoon, everyone.
Isn't it a beautiful day?

147
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:44,467
- How are the new living arrangements?
- Like a charm.

148
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:51,676
I don't know why we didn't do it
from the start.

149
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:55,469
- Is that right?
- I couldn't be happier, absolutely.

150
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,350
- Diane...
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

151
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:07,029
You'll have to excuse that.
I have some...

152
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:11,528
...some kind of an itch,
sort of in the back of my throat.

153
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:13,945
Have you ever had one of those?

154
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:21,129
Boy, it's almost as if it's inside my ear,
but not there either. You know?

155
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:24,665
That must be maddening.
Let me get you the ice pick.

156
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:31,003
I was sneezing all morning.
At least that's stopped.

157
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:36,555
- I wonder what causes it.
- That adorable puppy of Frasier's.

158
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:40,891
- Little Pavlov?
- She's very sweet, but I'm a cat person.

159
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:44,648
I obviously have some kind
of an allergy to dogs.

160
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,484
- Are you sure it's the dog?
- What else could it be?

161
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:51,906
You've been around that dog before.
You must have.

162
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:56,703
Moving in with Frasier
is a big commitment.

163
00:12:56,914 --> 00:13:02,122
I wonder if this whole so-called allergy
thing might not be psychosomatic.

164
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,585
Sam, I'm very impressed.

165
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:11,507
That's a complex psychological
concept coming from a man

166
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,546
who has to write L and R
on the bottom of his shoes.

167
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:22,887
- Does that mean you agree with me?
- Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,030
I just had this thought.

169
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:29,803
Could it be that you still
love somebody from your past?

170
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:34,157
- You?
- Well, not necessarily.

171
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:36,947
It could have been Sumner or anybody,

172
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,702
but isn't it interesting
that I spring to mind?

173
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:46,034
No. You automatically spring to mind
whenever I hear something stupid.

174
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:50,876
- Hello, my dearest darling.
- Frasier!

175
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:56,803
Gesundheit. I've reconsidered.
I was unyielding this morning.

176
00:13:56,973 --> 00:14:00,840
I realise your happiness comes first.
I must give up Pavlov.

177
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:05,265
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

178
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:08,642
I can't just put the little tyke
out on the streets.

179
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:12,686
I've must find the best home.
That's a lengthy process.

180
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:16,446
- I'll take her.
- Frasier, I realise that this may...

181
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:19,820
If the dog' s the only thing
standing between you,

182
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:24,492
then if I take her away, everything
will be fine for Diane, right?

183
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,917
I love dogs.
I'll give her a great home. I will.

184
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:33,081
There we are, then. Done, Sam,
done and by golly, done. She's yours.

185
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:37,172
Good. That should clear
just about everything up.

186
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:41,046
I should say so.
We're mighty grateful too. Aren't we?

187
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,724
Yes. In fact, do you want
to hear something funny?

188
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:49,271
Just knowing that the dog is going,
I'm already feeling better.

189
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,848
No more allergies.

190
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:56,773
Gesundheit.

191
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:13,082
- Hello, Sam.
- Frasier, what can I get you?

192
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,455
I've got a heavy patient load.

193
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:20,003
Make it a triple stinger
and a beer chaser.

194
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,635
No, let me have a club soda.

195
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:28,726
Sam, listen. Fill me in.
I'm hungry for news of little Pavlov.

196
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:32,146
Pavlov? You must mean little Diane.

197
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:38,529
- I beg your pardon?
- I renamed the puppy Diane.

198
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:41,731
I figured you wouldn't mind.
It's my puppy now.

199
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:43,715
I tell you, it's so wonderful.

200
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:47,320
Any trouble,
I swat her on the rear end and say,

201
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:51,958
"Shut up, Diane."
And she does. it's heaven.

202
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:58,796
Changing the dog's name
hurts me a little.

203
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,921
Don't you think
two Dianes will be confusing?

204
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:06,044
Maybe. We'll just have to call
your girlfriend Pavlov.

205
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:11,057
How are Pavlov's allergies
now that I got Diane?

206
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:15,230
These things don't
clear up overnight.

207
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,693
The latest symptom
is a recurring voice change.

208
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:23,694
- A what?
- You'll have to hear it.

209
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,487
I don't think words
can do it justice.

210
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,372
Where's Carla?

211
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,124
I did it.

212
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:43,124
I went out.
I got her a great birthday present.

213
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,386
You mean it's Carla's birthday
already again?

214
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,094
The older you get, time goes...

215
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:54,893
No. This is a real gift to make
up for those gag gifts we got.

216
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,933
A real gift which better be good.

217
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,566
Hi, sweetheart.

218
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:06,398
Hey, Carla. Many happy returns.

219
00:17:06,574 --> 00:17:09,825
No thanks. No more
hilarious gifts, OK?

220
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,100
My sides are still
sore from last week.

221
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:17,411
- Carla, it's a very nice gift.
- Yeah?

222
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:23,374
What does it do? Explode,
stink, or make disgusting sounds?

223
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:28,591
No, this is the real gift, Carla,
which better be good.

224
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:44,189
This is beautiful. I love this.
It's perfect.

225
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:49,734
This makes up for
everything, I think.

226
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:58,332
It's not easy for me
to say thanks, but thanks, guys.

227
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,459
Way to go, Cliff!

228
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:07,544
You haven't heard
the best part though.

229
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:11,086
The longer you wear it,
body heat makes the words,

230
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:15,925
"I am horny as a hoot owl"
appear right on the back.

231
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,888
Get him out of here.

232
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:31,688
- See you tomorrow, gang.
- Good night, Cliff.

233
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:35,317
Excuse me, Sam.
Something's been troubling me.

234
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:39,872
I gave you the wrong impression
that Diane and I are unhappy.

235
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,990
- No.
- We're going through an adjustment.

236
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,705
In fact, today I think
she's shown some improvement.

237
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:55,922
- Hello, everyone. Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, Diane.

238
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:04,647
- You're going to say gesundheit?
- We've moved past gesundheit.

239
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:08,433
We're now on our way to
"stuff a sock in it".

240
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,149
I'm sorry. You know I was joking.

241
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:16,775
How come you still have allergies
if I've got Diane?

242
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:21,581
- Diane?
- That's what he calls Pavlov.

243
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:26,125
Don't ask.
Diane, are you feeling any better?

244
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:33,502
There are obviously still traces of Pavlov
in the apartment, which I cannot remove.

245
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,087
She's tried.

246
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:40,468
I've had it fumigated, I've had
all the furniture reupholstered,

247
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,049
I've had the wallpaper steamed off.

248
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:45,932
Looks darned good, incidentally.

249
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:49,059
We discovered natural
brick on one wall.

250
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,439
The place needed redecorating.

251
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,193
How would you feel
about linoleum in the living room?

252
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,400
- What?
- A lot of people have done it.

253
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:01,464
I'm almost sure
I've seen pictures...

254
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,603
That's it! I can't
take it any more!

255
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:06,279
Denial and repression.

256
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,849
I devoted myself professionally
to fighting these

257
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,624
and now I'm wading in them upstream.

258
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,956
OK, keep the carpet!

259
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:19,546
We're both know allergic reactions
are psychosomatic.

260
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:22,010
There's a thought.

261
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:28,934
Maybe on some subconscious level,
you don't want to be living with me.

262
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:32,104
Frasier, it's the dog.
I keep telling you.

263
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,127
It's the dog!

264
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,727
The voice.

265
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,489
Diane, the damn dog is gone.

266
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,561
She's halfway across the city!

267
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:46,309
I don't want to put
you through all this.

268
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:52,161
Frasier, we've made
a commitment here.

269
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:56,085
You're not ready yet
for this kind of commitment.

270
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:59,424
Perhaps some day you will be.
We'll wait and see.

271
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,752
No, I'm going to make this work.

272
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,346
Diane, please, don't hold on to this
for me. I love you.

273
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,522
But I think your health
is more important.

274
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,981
Maybe you're right.

275
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:22,692
I'm sure I'm right. Now, listen.
Go and gargle and spray your throat.

276
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:28,109
Use your inhaler, take your antihistamine
and put your nose drops in.

277
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:32,202
Use whatever else you find
in that pharmacy you call a purse.

278
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,425
Well, Sam, aren't you going to gloat?

279
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,428
I like to think I'm
above that, Diane.

280
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,852
Am I nuts, or is that kind of sexy?

281
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,776
Frasier, that's a tough break.

282
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,943
Damn it. I thought we were
going to make it work in a big way.

283
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:09,196
I bet you do and I bet you do it
pretty soon. Will you excuse me?

284
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,439
The problem is now
I'm entirely alone.

285
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,352
Yeah, that's tough.

286
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,038
I want my doggy back!

287
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,337
Frasier, I've grown accustomed
to the old girl.

288
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,840
My emotional need for her
is stronger than yours.

289
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,217
- She's mine.
- But I love her.

290
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,922
- Find another one.
- I don't want to talk about this.

291
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,804
Nothing can make me change my mind.

292
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,476
She's mine.
You were just a port in the storm.

293
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,687
I want her and I'll have her.

294
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,242
Don't stand in my way or
you'll suffer my wrath.

295
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:44,924
Do I make myself clear?

296
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,440
Frasier, this is so exciting.

297
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:55,204
You are the only man to proclaim his
feelings for me with such eloquence.

298
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,946
What we were talking about...

299
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,709
She knows what and who
we were talking about.

300
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,007
She's a clever girl
and a beautiful one.

301
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:12,508
Frasier, do you know that there's
a Kurosawa film festival at Cambridge?

302
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:15,089
I'm not really in the mood to go...

303
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,056
Kurosawa, you say?

304
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,266
Kurosawa and I'm really in the mood.

305
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,976
I could see his films
again and again...

306
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:30,234
Sam, could I have the afternoon off,
please?

307
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:34,701
You wouldn't want to stand between me
and Diane and "The Seven Samurai"?

308
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,820
No. I hope all nine of you
have a wonderful time.

309
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:56,134
Sammy, Frasier walks out of here with
Diane and you get to go home to a dog.

310
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,433
Yeah, somebody up there likes me.
