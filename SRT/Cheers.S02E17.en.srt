00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:07,530
FORTUNE AND MEN'S WEIGHT

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,160
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

3
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,915
- How does a beer sound?
- I finish 'em before they get a word in.

4
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:24,130
Aren't you a bit dressed up
to come here and suck on taps?

5
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:28,968
If you must know, I've other pIans
for this evening. I've a date.

6
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:32,347
- Who is it?
- A bIind date.

7
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:35,808
- Dangerous.
- WaIking into a minefieId.

8
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:40,021
A friend set us up.
He assures me she's perfect for me.

9
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:42,232
That's what they aII say.

10
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:47,362
She had good tabIe manners, great
personaIity and an exceIIent posture?

11
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:50,406
They aIways make it sound good.

12
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:54,452
As a matter of fact,
he said she was easy on the eye.

13
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,038
You're a dead man, Norm.

14
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:18,035
- Where do you want it?
- Want what? I didn't order that.

15
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:21,038
- Cheers, right?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:24,542
Coach, did you buy this?

17
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,963
- Not me, Sam.
- Your name is on the invoice.

18
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,049
It's a mistake. Why wouId I buy a crate?

19
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,682
- It's an antique scaIe.
- I bought the scaIe.

20
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,561
Now that I Iook at it, I'm disappointed.

21
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,815
We're in a hurry. Can you sign it?

22
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:54,405
Why did you do this? Don't buy anything
for the bar without checking with me.

23
00:02:54,572 --> 00:03:00,828
I'm sorry, Sam. That saIesman, I couIdn't
resist him. He had a way about him.

24
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:06,751
- One of those fast taIkers?
- No. Big taII skinny guy with a beard.

25
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:12,507
Reminded me of somebody in history.
The president who freed the sIaves.

26
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:17,386
- Abraham LincoIn?
- OnIy this guy wasn't nice at aII.

27
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:20,681
As a matter of fact,
he was kind of mean.

28
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:26,103
He reminded me of that IittIe guy
in Germany with the moustache.

29
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,901
- AdoIf HitIer?
- Don't pIay trivia with this guy.

30
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:35,488
A cross between
Abraham LincoIn and HitIer?

31
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:39,659
Normie, I don't know.
He was strange, Normie.

32
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:43,621
He was dressed in bIack,
his eyes shined Iike coaIs

33
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:47,041
and he had a deep voice
and he said to me,

34
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:53,589
''This scaIe wiII not onIy teII you your
weight, but it wiII teII you your destiny.''

35
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:56,509
- He had an accent?
- No.

36
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:03,349
Then why did you say it Iike your weight
and your destiny?

37
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,852
Just a IittIe coIour, CarIa.

38
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,943
- I'm caIIing him to say we don't want it.
- I'd Iike to see what it Iooks Iike.

39
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,113
And it teIIs your fortune.

40
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,532
- Go on. Open it.
- Goody.

41
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,742
I'm stiII sending it back.

42
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,287
Coach, give Norman a screwdriver,
pIease.

43
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:28,916
I've got a big date.
I don't want to get pits.

44
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,502
Come on. It won't be that hard.

45
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,302
We'II stop you
before your shoes get squishy.

46
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:49,770
Here's an opening hint from a guy
who's opened a Iot of these rascaIs.

47
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:54,567
If you smack this baby here,
it'II open up Iike a big waInut.

48
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:57,778
That's the epicentre of the fuIcrum.

49
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:03,200
Step back, Diane.
This thing'II shear your kneecaps off.

50
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:13,210
- Are you aII right?
- I can't find my shoes, CIyde.

51
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:18,340
- I think the dog got them.
- Sit right here. Here we go.

52
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,221
Let's get her out.

53
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:33,272
- Ain't that nice?
- I Iike it. Can we keep it?

54
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,195
I'm afraid we're going to have to.
The number's been disconnected.

55
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,781
The guy's obviousIy a conman.

56
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:46,327
I knew he was a conman
the minute I Iaid eyes on him.

57
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:52,500
As a coIIector of antiques, I think it might
some day be worth what you paid for it.

58
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,669
Or a fraction thereof.

59
00:05:55,836 --> 00:06:01,842
Sam, the saIesman aIso said, ''This
scaIe is not being made any more.''

60
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,055
''This one was in a ceIIar
for over 40 years.''

61
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:09,808
Coach, you shouIdn't have bought it.

62
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:14,522
- This has been fun, but I gotta go.
- Normie, get on the scaIe.

63
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:17,441
See how you'II make out tonight.

64
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:22,863
Come on. It doesn't have
any fortunes Ieft after aII these years.

65
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,660
Do you get tired of being wrong?

66
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:31,247
''Your most troubIesome probIem
wiII be soIved.''

67
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:36,126
Sounds Iike you're going to get a trim
on the oId antIers tonight.

68
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:39,755
Norm,
what's your most troubIesome probIem?

69
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:45,594
That's tough to say, Coach.
Let's see. I'm overweight, unempIoyed,

70
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:49,723
separated, depressed,
starting to drink too much.

71
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,144
I guess my biggest probIem
is I've never been happier.

72
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:59,900
- I'm going next.
- Wait. Men in uniform first, CarIa.

73
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:05,406
They Iove it. It wiII be bigger
than that amusement park in CaIifornia.

74
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:09,410
- The one with the mouse and the duck.
- DisneyIand.

75
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:13,872
You're tough, Sam,
but I'm gonna get you.

76
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,011
- ''Sanderson, FIorist.''
- What's the occasion, Sam?

77
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,221
For Diane.

78
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,473
Did she die?

79
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,893
- Of course not.
- Is she dying?

80
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,105
Is she suffering? Throw me a bone.

81
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:43,277
No. She'II be mad cos I didn't take her
to some stupid art show.

82
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:48,157
FIowers are the way to caIm her down.
Hi. Sanderson, FIorist?

83
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:53,746
There's my guy.
Give me a big smoocheroo.

84
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,712
- You're not mad?
- Of course not.

85
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,840
I just missed you so, you big Iug.

86
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:10,471
Keep up the good work.

87
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,641
- Hey, everybody.
- What's up, Normie?

88
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:20,064
- The corners of my mouth.
- Sounds Iike that bIind date paid off.

89
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,609
It turns out my buddy
pIayed a trick on me.

90
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:28,071
Guess who the date turns out to be?
My ex. Vera.

91
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,702
Ready for the punch Iine?
We're back together.

92
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:36,121
Norman, that's wonderfuI.

93
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:39,958
I feeI so good,
I'd Iike to set up the entire bar.

94
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:45,839
But as that's financiaIIy impossibIe,
I'II settIe for buying CIiff a drink.

95
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:51,345
Thank you, Norm. Chivas on the rocks.

96
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:56,141
What, 1 2-year-oId Scotch?
I was thinking more Iike a beer.

97
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,353
Come on. This is great news.
You got Vera back.

98
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,482
Yeah, Vera. Not Nastassja Kinsky. Vera.

99
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,360
Beer, Coach.

100
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:12,658
What's it Iike to go out on a bIind date
and then you find out it's your own wife?

101
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:16,370
WeII,
we were both kind of nervous at first.

102
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:22,918
Then we spIit some cIams casino and a
IittIe Chateaubriand, her favourite wine.

103
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:27,172
Next thing, we went back
to what used to be our pIace

104
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:30,926
and...we kind of made Iove.

105
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,512
You can't kind of make Iove.

106
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,348
You don't know Vera.

107
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,769
- Oh, my God!
- What?

108
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,771
It's happening!

109
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:48,735
She's Iosing what's Ieft of her grey
matter and I don't mean her underwear.

110
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,948
- What's wrong?
- It's his fortune.

111
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:57,494
The machine said his worst probIem
wouId be soIved and Vera's back.

112
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,831
CarIa, that was entireIy fortuitous.

113
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:07,004
You're right, Diane. My IittIe card said
I wouId hear from a distant Ioved one.

114
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,301
Sure enough, a haIf hour Iater,
my daughter in PennsyIvania caIIs me.

115
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:16,596
No. That doesn't count.
She aIways caIIs you.

116
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:21,893
- PennsyIvania's not that distant.
- She caIIed me from CaIifornia.

117
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,272
She's on vacation there.

118
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:29,443
It had nothing to do with your fortune,
or Norman's.

119
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:35,407
Yeah? How about this? My fortune said,
''Time waits for no one.''

120
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:41,580
Last night, I get home Iate and my kids
had started a fire cooking their dinner.

121
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:45,667
- ExpIain that.
- Easy. You're an idiot.

122
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,717
Look, there are things you eggheads
can't expIain away in this worId.

123
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:58,138
Listen, nothing and nobody
controIs what happens to us.

124
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:01,558
You had a Iucky piece when you pitched.

125
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:07,105
A Iot of good it did me. The onIy battIes
I ever won in Iife, I won on my own.

126
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,986
- That was briIIiantIy put.
- You said that to me a few days ago.

127
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:17,365
But you remembered it
and used it in the proper context.

128
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,829
Yeah, they shouId carve his face
on a mountain.

129
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:29,336
You've been with Diane so Iong, you
can't see the facts in front of your nose.

130
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,130
This machine has powers.

131
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,969
I guess I shouId get on
and see what the future hoIds for me.

132
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:40,388
Don't joke about this.

133
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,935
What on earth are you doing?

134
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:50,357
I'm warding off eviI spirits.
If you weren't stupid, you'd do the same.

135
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:52,567
Preposterous.

136
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,703
- What does the card say?
- What difference does it make?

137
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:07,749
''Deception in romance proves costIy.''

138
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,670
You see.
You know how she feeIs about honesty.

139
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:13,839
She Iikes it.

140
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:17,050
- Honest as the day is Iong.
- AbsoIuteIy.

141
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:20,428
Now, can we aII go back to work,
pIease?

142
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,639
Good idea.

143
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,078
Are you aII right?

144
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:07,874
That's $20 postage due, sir,
and how are we today?

145
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:13,296
- CIiff, you're in Cheers.
- Cheers. Yes, sir. I know where that is.

146
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:22,222
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah. Just bruised my knee.

147
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:27,727
I hope I'II be abIe
to do my postaI round tomorrow.

148
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:33,233
- Do you want to get an X-ray?
- No. I'II just check it out here.

149
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,323
I'm fine.

150
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:46,162
Wait a minute, CIiff.

151
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:50,208
You got a fortune from that machine.
What was it?

152
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,502
What was it?

153
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:56,548
Did it say anything
about faIIing down stairs?

154
00:13:56,714 --> 00:14:00,093
I remember. It was ''TaIk to bigwigs''.

155
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,305
- What ''ooh''?
- I don't know yet.

156
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:07,851
But there must be a connection.

157
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:14,774
- You're not in the baIIpark on this one.
- Wait. I got it. Bigwig, right?

158
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:19,195
- Who is the biggest bigwig of them aII?
- Sinatra.

159
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:30,957
- No. Even bigger.
- RonaId Reagan.

160
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,835
- No. Bigger.
- Sinatra.

161
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:49,475
If you ask me who runs this country, it's
big oiI companies. Who runs Texaco?

162
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:52,770
At my station, Dave and his son Herbie.

163
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,860
Machmoud does the windows.

164
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:04,282
You can't get much bigger
than Herbie, Dave and Machmoud.

165
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:11,372
I am taIking about God.
God is the biggest wig of them aII.

166
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:16,127
CIiff, did you pray
before you Ieft home this morning?

167
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:24,177
There you go. If you had prayed,
none of this wouId have happened.

168
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:33,061
Come on. If you stretch it this far, you
can make anything out of those fortunes.

169
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:37,231
- I hope this is nothing. Mine was bad.
- What was it?

170
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:44,030
It said, ''Your vaIuabIes are in jeopardy.''
I'II show it to you. It's in my waIIet.

171
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:46,491
Somebody Iifted my waIIet.

172
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:51,704
CarIa, wiII you take it easy?
He'II owe you the tip.

173
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:01,255
How do you expIain that, Sammy?

174
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,760
- I found it.
- What do you say about that, CarIa?

175
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:13,935
It makes no difference. The machine has
been right up untiI now. I say it's eviI.

176
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,066
It heard me. I'm sorry.

177
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,652
Forgive me.

178
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:27,448
Stop it. Everybody's Iooking.
Come on.

179
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:34,247
I don't want to hear any more about it. It
is not magic. You can't take it seriousIy.

180
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:39,752
It's a sad worId we Iive in when Sam
MaIone becomes the voice of reason.

181
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:48,553
What am I taIking for? Diane taIks good.
TeII them how dumb they're being.

182
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,598
You're being dumb.

183
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,772
Had enough?

184
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:18,166
WeII, I guess I'd better get one more
just to make sure it's safe to go home.

185
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,762
I can't Iook.
Sam, wouId you read it for me?

186
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,057
Don't read it if it's terribIe.

187
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:39,562
It's OK.
''You wiII grow Iips on your forehead.''

188
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,401
Very funny.

189
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:53,993
- It's OK. See you tomorrow.
- Good night, CarIa. See you, kid.

190
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,789
- Keep it up. You'II pay.
- Thank you, CarIa. Bye-bye.

191
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,709
- Night, Sam.
- Good night, Coach.

192
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:11,135
- What are you doing?
- Seeing if I gained weight.

193
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:15,848
- You didn't. Get off.
- What's wrong? You're acting strange.

194
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:19,727
- I'm acting fine.
- Let me get my weight here.

195
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:24,148
- Sam, don't.
- WiII you teII me what's going on?

196
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:27,276
You're coming ungIued here.

197
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:31,405
I feeI Iike I'm Iosing my mind.

198
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,202
- That scaIe has me spooked.
- You're kidding me?

199
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:41,332
You're the Iast person
I expect to faII for that voodoo stuff.

200
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:45,544
- Do you remember that fortune I got?
- No.

201
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:54,178
- ''Deception in romance proves costIy.''
- So?

202
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:58,975
I took another man
to that show Iast night.

203
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:02,728
You mean, Iike a guy?

204
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:11,696
At Ieast pay attention. He's a cIassmate
of mine. A maIe cIassmate.

205
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:15,950
So you took some pimpIy wimp
from schooI. Big deaI.

206
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:20,746
His compIexion is as cIear as mine
and we had a wonderfuI time.

207
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,835
At the performance?

208
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:32,675
Of course he took me home.

209
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:36,137
And?

210
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:40,599
I invited him in. We had coffee.
He Ieft. That was it.

211
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:47,273
Instant coffee
or did you grind the beans?

212
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:53,446
It wasn't the same as it is with you.
I didn't grind them fine.

213
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:57,867
You did grind the beans?

214
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,912
AII we did was taIk.

215
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:07,793
- You didn't kiss him?
- I kissed him good night. It was nothing.

216
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,714
It was bareIy on the Iips.
On the side. Very dry.

217
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:22,308
I have to be honest.

218
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:25,603
It was so good to taIk to someone.

219
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:31,317
I miss taIking about the things
I can't taIk about with you.

220
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:35,905
I didn't teII you because you'd be angry.

221
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:39,158
- I'm not angry.
- Of course you are.

222
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:45,456
No, I'm not. As a matter of fact,
I'm kind of gratefuI.

223
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:49,126
I think I see our reIationship
in a new Iight.

224
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:56,383
The truth is I don't fuIfiI aII your needs
and you don't fuIfiI aII mine.

225
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,303
So maybe we shouId caII it quits.

226
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:06,810
What are you doing?
I have one innocent evening with a guy.

227
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:12,233
I come to you to make a cIean breast
of it and this is the reaction I get.

228
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:17,780
You're even Iess understanding
than I feared. Fine. I want out of this.

229
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:21,075
Out of what? I aIready broke it off.

230
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:28,999
You said, ''Maybe we shouId caII it quits.''
I'm saying it's definiteIy over.

231
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:33,712
Hey, I don't care what I said.
In my mind, it was definite.

232
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:38,133
That ship has saiIed.
Our reIationship is through.

233
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:45,849
No, we're not through,
unIess I say we're through.

234
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:51,397
We're through. Now we're through.

235
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:55,985
I'm not having an argument
about who broke up with who first.

236
00:21:56,151 --> 00:22:01,699
With somebody I broke up with. I'm not
going to acknowIedge your presence.

237
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:09,206
Is anybody here? Somebody I used
to go with? No. It's just Diane. SiIIy me.

238
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:16,005
- Don't do this.
- It's aIready done.

239
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:22,553
Sam, pIease.
PIease don't joke about this.

240
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,681
I'm scared.

241
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:33,731
We can't break up because a piIe
of metaI springs said we were going to.

242
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:37,568
There's too much at stake.

243
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:45,159
I'm sorry.

244
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,495
Forgive me.

245
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:53,375
- TeII me you didn't break up with me.
- Of course I didn't.

246
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,794
Then I'm first.

247
00:22:56,837 --> 00:23:01,425
- You are history.
- That was a rotten...

248
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:06,930
Now I know why I broke up with you
Iong before you broke up with me.

249
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:11,560
Who's taIking?

250
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,646
It's just my empIoyer.

251
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:29,119
Sam, we got a fortune.

252
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:32,247
- So?
- Aren't you going to read it?

253
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,541
No. What's the point?

254
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:43,258
Our destiny may be in that card.
I know it. I can feeI it.

255
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:50,265
- You're crackers. You know that?
- Then read it.

256
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,812
OK. Fine.

257
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,693
You sure we shouId do this?

258
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,073
We've got to.
There might be no other way.

259
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,283
AII right.

260
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:13,664
''Machine empty.
Order more fortunes today.''
