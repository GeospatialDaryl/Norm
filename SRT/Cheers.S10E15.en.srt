<i>Cheers is filmed

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,947
Cold outside, huh?

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,216
Yes.

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,185
And we got a slush
thing going.

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,089
So it seems.

6
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,226
Beer nut?

7
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,961
No, thank you.

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,934
Have you ever been
with an older man?

9
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,072
Woody, I'm ready
to settle up.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,941
I'm not looking
for commitment.

11
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:53,419
Cold outside, huh?

12
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,290

you got?

10:36.

29
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,198
All right,
lunchtime.

30
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,335
Wood... let's
order, please.

31
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,970
Oh, okay,
what will you guys have?

32
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,973
Chinese, subs, cheese steak,
Mexican?

33
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,408
Mmm, sounds good.

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,109
Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,110
Now, wait a minute.

36
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,211
The lunch special upstairs

37
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,846
at Melville's today
is crab salad.

38
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,881
Yeah?

39
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,049
Yeah. It's delicious.

40
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,917
If you ask Mr. Hill
really, really nice,

41
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,019
he'll give you your pick
of the leftovers.

42
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,888
Leftovers?

43
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,489
Woody, why don't you
just go out back

44
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,358
and crawl through
the Dumpster, huh?

45
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,559
What for?

46
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,560
All he throws back there is

47
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,529
the food that clogs up
his drain.

48
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,098
You know,
the, the greasy fried stuff.

49
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,838
Don't even think
about it.

50
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,174
You were thinking
the same thing.

51
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,809
Yeah, but not
as long as you.

52
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,079
I have a problem, don't I?

53
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,715
Well, what about you, Sam?
You want some crab salad?

54
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:03,849
From Melville's?
Forget it.

55
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,184
I hate that guy John Hill.

56
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,385
I'd like to rip his head off

57
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,520
and dribble it
down Beacon Street.

58
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,956
Well, forget
the crab salad, Sam.

59
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,991
I think you could use something
with a little fiber in it.

60
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,531
Woody, I forbid you to eat
that man's food.

61
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,033
Well, Sam, it's
a free lunch,

62
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,901
and you know
how much I make.

63
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,770
I mean, I don't always
have enough money for lunch,

64
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,271
but I do get
awful hungry.

65
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,740
And, remember,
we had that talk

66
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,642
about the pretzels being
just for the customers.

67
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,846
Oh, go on, go on,
get out of here.

68
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,715
Go eat your stupid salad.

69
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,319
Sam, just how much
do you pay that boy?

70
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,621
I pay him
a fair amount.

71
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,156
See, Fras, I don't think
you understand

72
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,058
that a, a bartender's
hourly wage is

73
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,828
just a very small portion
of his overall income.

74
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,532
<i>Most of it comes
from tips.</i>

75
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,535
I see.

76
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,706
I won't bring it up again, Sam.

77
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,308
I think that'd be best.

78
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,544
Hey, everybody,
shut your yaps.

79
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,980
My son has a big
announcement to make.

80
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,481
Okay, go on, Gino,
tell them

81
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,383
what you told me
before in the car.

82
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,053
I said, "Ma, I think
I want to be a priest."

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,188
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?!

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,590
My kid is going to be
a priest.

85
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,527
Finally, when I visit
one of my kids on Sunday,

86
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,065
there's not going to be
an inch of glass between us.

87
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,766
Well, congratulations,
Gino.

88
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,234
I'm happy for you.

89
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,036
Happy for him?
That's not enough, Sam.

90
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,604
This calls
for a beer.

91
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,440
Come on, the guy's
underage, Norm.

92
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,741
Oh, it's not for him.

93
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,609
Can't I be happy
for the lad?

94
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,911
Gino, here you go.

95
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,212
I want to give you
a little money here.

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,513
I want you to go out,

97
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,182
buy yourself
some nice clothes, okay?

98
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,484
I don't want God to think
he's getting himself a bum.

99
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,086
Thanks, Ma.

100
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,287
Congratulations,
Gino.

101
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,888
I think it's terrific
when a young man

102
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,523
like yourself finds
his calling.

103
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,025
I'm happy for you.

104
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,094
Oh, yeah?
How happy?

105
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,328
Why don't you, uh, show me?

106
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,334
You know that if you have
a kid who's a priest or a nun,

107
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,236
you automatically
get into Heaven.

108
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,271
No questions asked.

109
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,506
PAUL:
Can I get
a beer, Carla?

110
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,776
Ah. Paul, Paul...

111
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,112
There!

112
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,513
(laughs)

113
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,416
Isn't this great?

114
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,854
Right now, God is shrugging
and saying, "What can I do?"

115
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,291
Hey, everybody.

116
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,160
You'll all be very
happy to know

117
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,729
that I am now a, uh,
published humorist.

118
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,931
<i>Wow. The Post Office
Newsletter.</i>

119
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,600
I hear that's tough
to get into.

120
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,736
Oh, yeah, I'll say.

121
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,539
Yeah, they've been after me
for quite some time now,

122
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,007
and I finally gave them
permission to,

123
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,244
uh, print one
of my "daffynitions."

124
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,546
All right,
let's hear it.
(others groan)

125
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,214
What? Hey, hey, he was
going to do it anyway.

126
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,651
Don't make me
the bad guy here.

127
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,853
Here you go, uh...
Daffynition,

128
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,555

129
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,158
What happens to your feet
after your finish your route.

130
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,427
(chuckles)

131
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,228
Now, Lilith, you, uh, you
thought that was funny?

132
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,863
LILITH:
Oh, yes.

133
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,733
You should see her
at a Marx Brothers' movie.

134
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,703
Isn't Zeppo
hysterical?

135
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,905
The way he just
stands there

136
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,773
without expression
or reaction.

137
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,443
Boy, that
cracks me up.

138
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,778
You guys are really missing out.

139
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,347
This crab salad looks great.

140
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,015
All right.
Where's ours?

141
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,783
Well, I thought you said
you didn't want any.

142
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,352
I don't remember saying that.
Do you, Norm?

143
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,854
I never said
that in my life.

144
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,089
Come on. I thought you guys

145
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,223
were going to order
something else.

146
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,458
Well, we didn't,
Woody.

147
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,759
It's nearly 11:00.

148
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,595
I'm getting
a little dizzy.

149
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,497
That does look
kind of good.

150
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,433
Aah, I can't give
you guys my food every day.

151
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,868
Woody, it's
not every day.

152
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,670
It's just on days I'm
particularly hungry, okay?

153
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,338
Don't bite my head off.
I mean it.

154
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,540
You know, you've got
that look in your eye.

155
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,509
Ow... Oh! Aah...

156
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,844
What's wrong, Sam?

157
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,278
Oh, I think I broke my tooth.

158
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,880
I don't believe that.

159
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,715
There's a shell
in this salad.

160
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,517
I'm going to sue him
for everything he's worth.

161
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,420
Oh, great! Just when
I get a little ahead

162
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,356
in my checking account.

163
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,792
Not you, Woody-- Hill.

164
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,427
Ooh, you know
something?

165
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,529
I am going to sue him.

166
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,632
Oh, yes! Oh, yes,
and I'm going to win, too.

167
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,468
Here's to me!
All right.

168
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,437
(grunting)

169
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,612
Hey, Becs,
what you doing?

170
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
Well, I'm trying
to get these receipts ready

171
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,715
for income tax time.

172
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,417
Man, I wish you
people would just write

173
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,851
the dates
on these things.

174
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,753
Half of them I had
to cross-reference

175
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,121
against
the register tape.

176
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,824
It took me half the night
to get these organized.

177
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,958
Gee, up all night.

178
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,727
You could catch a chill.

179
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,062
Here, let me warm you up.

180
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,230
No! Don't!

181
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,599
Stop it!

182
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,003
You are evil!

183
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,072
That's right, all day long.

184
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,841
And it doesn't matter,
because my son is good,

185
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,310
and I've got myself
a get-out-of-Hell-free card.

186
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,214
You know, uh,

187
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,750
I've been thinking about Carla's
son becoming priest.

188
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,552
Get this, "My son, the father."

189
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,288
Get it?
"My son, the father."

190
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,291
That's a rich comedy area,
I'm telling you.

191
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,960
Lord help me, I miss
the "daffynitions."

192
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,163
Oh, hey, do I hear a request?

193
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,366
Okay. Daffynition.
Psychiatrist:

194
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,636
a guy who shrinks your head
and your bank account.

195
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,905
(chuckling):
Ouch.

196
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,407
Yeah...

197
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,442
Bull's-eye.

198
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,944
NORM:
Yeah, well, you know,

199
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,114
I've got enough material for
an entire stand-up comedy act.

200
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,515
Okay, all right, uh...

201
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,917
Why is it that women go
to a "stylist"

202
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,753
and men go to barbers?

203
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,321
What's up with that?

204
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,158
(chuckles):
That's so true.

205
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,695
I got an impersonation for you.

206
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,597
An impression, ready?

207
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,067
I am not a crook.

208
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,869
(chuckles)

209
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,476
Well, you guys know me.
Home to see Vera.

210
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,213
I want to go, too, Norm.

211
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,582
I, I heard so many good things.

212
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,519
Oh, please don't leave me.

213
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah, you know, I was,
uh, watching

214
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,755
this commercial on TV
with the Ginsu knives.

215
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,590
Hey, what's up with that?

216
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,160
(chuckles):
I hate that commercial.

217
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,228
This is good stuff.

218
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,499
You know, she can also
hear a dog-whistle.

219
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,168
NORM:
You know, uh,

220
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,536
you know,
all my life I've, uh,

221
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,339
kind of wanted to be
a stand-up comedian.

222
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,573
You know, uh, oh,
here, here it is.

223
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,607
How's this for an idea?

224
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,976
Comedy night at Cheers.

225
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,646
Seven nights a week,
six shows a night.

226
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,951
The cock-eyed mind
of Cliff Clavin.

227
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,686
So you're saying it'd be
just like any other night

228
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,954
except for the mike?

229
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,189
NORM:
Yeah, yeah!

230
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,257
Hey, hey, what to you
say there, Becs? Huh?

231
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,727
Well, I guess you could do
your comedy here, Cliff.

232
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,894
But you know what?

233
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,096
I mean, wouldn't
you rather do it

234
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,097
at a professional
comedy club?

235
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,832
Huh?
You know,
the Laugh Tureen

236
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,100
in Kenmore Square has
an open mike night.

237
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,434
Oh, yeah.

238
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,736
As a matter of fact,
I think it's tonight.

239
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,871
Hey, that's a great
idea, Rebecca.

240
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,706
I'll just, uh, yeah,
spend the afternoon

241
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,509
polishing up my act and,
uh, showcase it there tonight.

242
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,444
Oh, why waste all this stuff
on you guys?

243
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,213
See you later.

244
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,051
And you people think
I'm so stupid.

245
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,428
Sam, did you see your dentist?
Did you get your tooth fixed?

246
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,064
(lisping):
Yeth... Good as new.

247
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,433
They shoot you
full of Novocain?

248
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,770
Yeth, they did.
It's all worn off now.

249
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,705
All right, there now.

250
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,173
There's all my receipts.

251
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,042
Now I'm ready.

252
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,112
Where's my calculator?

253
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,181
Oh, oh, here it is.

254
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,283
I was just washing
it off for you.

255
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,952
(gasps)
Here you go.

256
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,222
Come on, just plug it in
and start tapping away.

257
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,326
Carla, this is, this is
an expensive calculator.

258
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,594
Oh, yeah.

259
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
I'm probably going to rot
in Hell for that.

260
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,665
Not!

261
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,439
Ah, Miss Tortelli,
nice to see you again.

262
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,474
What're you doing
down here, Hill?

263
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,810
Hope you're not here
to ask me for a date.

264
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,811
Date?

265
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,212
Is that what you call it?

266
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,681
I think we skipped dating,
Miss Tortelli,

267
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,184
and went straight
to the fall of Rome.

268
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,052
Tell me,

269
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,388
is the rumor true your son's
going to be a priest?

270
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,856
Yeah, what of it?

271
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,025
Well, I didn't realize
you were Catholic.

272
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,593
The only time
I've heard you say

273
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,161
anything remotely
religious

274
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,996
was that night
a few weeks ago

275
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,000
when you called me
Zeus.

276
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,339
The hell I did.

277
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,109
You want me to run
the videotape?

278
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,815
Ah, Hill.

279
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,817
Uh, Sam, you wanted
to see me?

280
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,819
<i>Yeth, I did.</i>

281
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,523
What do you think
that is?

282
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,359
Well, it looks like some kind
of animal tooth, Sam.

283
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,495
Is my tooth.

284
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,663
I broke it
on your salad.

285
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,500
And I want you to know
I will see you in court.

286
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,335
Oh.
Yeah.

287
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,337
Good heavens, this
is frightening.

288
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,672
I'm being sued.

289
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,908
By Elmer Fudd.

290
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,411
Listen, Sam,

291
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,579
I don't recall selling
you any crab salad.

292
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,581
And I don't recall
you being in
my restaurant.

293
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,618
What I do remember is
that I gave Woody
some leftovers,

294
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,620
and you can't sue
me for that.

295
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:38,223
Incidentally, Sam,
you're drooling.

296
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,529
That guy dwives me cwazy.

297
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,731
Oh, oh, Becs,

298
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,765
there you are.

299
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,300
They just called
for you.

300
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,403
Apparently, there's been a
horrible fire at your apartment.

301
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,738
Oh, right, Carla,

302
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,373
you've been trying to get
to me all day long.

303
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,974
Just knock it off. It's
not even funny anymore.

304
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,976
I'm being totally
serious.

305
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,978
I know this is
the worst time

306
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,047
for you to hear this kind
of news from me.

307
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,482
I know you don't
believe me, but,

308
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,950
really, I'm telling
the truth.

309
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,386
I wouldn't joke about
something like that.

310
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,455
You're serious about
this, aren't you?

311
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,190
Yeah, I am, Becs.
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,225
Oh, my God!

313
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,227
Everything I own.

314
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,895
It's gone!

315
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,063
Oh, dear!

316
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,965
Woody, cover for me, please.

317
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,300
I got to go out.

318
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,668
(crying):
I'm too upset, Miss Howe.

319
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:26,105
I just found out my whole
apartment building burned down.

320
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,142
(laughing maniacally)

321
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,745
This is sick!

322
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,180
Yeah, but it's funny.

323
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,851
Carla, you have, you have
to stop this now.

324
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:39,918
Or what?

325
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,254
God'll smite me
with his sword?

326
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,922
He gets it halfway out,

327
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,824
an angel taps
him on his shoulder

328
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,327
and says, "Hold it,
her kid's a priest."

329
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,763
God just stands there fuming.

330
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,066
Hey, Ma, check it out.

331
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,136
Gino, what,
what are you wearing?

332
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,405
Isn't that a little flashy
for a priest?

333
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,572
Oh, no, a priest.

334
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,707
That was
this morning.

335
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,042
I'm gonna
be a male model.

336
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,377
I figured why waste these
looks on the church?

337
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,380
(thunder rumbling)

338
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,985
Uh-oh.

339
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,633
(whimpering)

340
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,668
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,671
I'm so sorry.

342
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,673
Carla, you've been leaping out
of your skin

343
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,408
every time there's a clap
of thunder.

344
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,577
Surely you know it's simply
static electricity

345
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,346
being discharged into
the atmosphere.

346
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,915
You are so naive!

347
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,150
Carla, you've got to calm down.

348
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,552
CARLA:
You don't get it!

349
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,320
I mocked God!

350
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,589
And this is not like getting
in trouble with your parents

351
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,291
or your teachers or your boss.

352
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,592
I mean, this is God!

353
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,760
Famine, flood,

354
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,695
pestilence, disease.

355
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,430
Who do you think came up
with that?

356
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,631
(thunder rumbling)

357
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,700
(moans)

358
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,737
He is just toying with me now.

359
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,172
Carla, you can't believe

360
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,208
that God has a personal vendetta
against you.

361
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,342
Look at my kids.

362
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,610
Look at my husbands.

363
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,678
Look at my life.

364
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,346
What do you think?

365
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,183
Uh, I don't think
any major religion

366
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,253
still propounds the theory
of a vindictive God,

367
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,788
who hurls thunderbolts

368
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,691
and takes personal vengeance
on people's transgressions.

369
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,593
(thunder roaring)

370
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,296
I believe that's for you.

371
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,564
Okay.

372
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,634
Okay, I got it.

373
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,636
Starting right now,

374
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,439
I'm gonna lead the perfect life.

375
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,475
I'm gonna be good.

376
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,811
Gonna be nice.

377
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,881
From now on,
I'm going to be nice.

378
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,616
Carla, would you please
serve table seven?

379
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,584
Shut up!

380
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,320
So far, so good.

381
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,323
You know, Carla never
ceases to amaze me.

382
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,326
She has a strange
mixture of fervent
religious faith

383
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,762
and primitive
superstition.

384
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,597
I suppose it's
a result

385
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,634
of our ever-changing,
mixed-up culture.

386
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,003
I don't know
that you should blame

387
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,772
Carla's belief system
on culture, Frasier.

388
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,775
The need to worship higher
intelligence is an innate

389
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,777
and universal
phenomenon.

390
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,113
In fact,
in recent weeks,

391
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,416
it's become clear
that my lab rats worship me

392
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,152
as a goddess.

393
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,656
I must confess,

394
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,658
I don't discourage them.

395
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,662
That's very
interesting, dear.

396
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,665
Apropos of
nothing, uh,

397
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,668
how many vacation days
do you have coming?

398
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,003
I don't know.

399
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,438
Uh... 80, 85.

400
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,478
Well, what do you
say we cash 50,

401
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,280
60 of those in and have
you spend a little time

402
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,449
with, uh, some, oh...

403
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,818
I don't know,
some people?

404
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,692
Sam, where have you been
all afternoon?

405
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,694
Oh, just pacing back and forth
with my sign,

406
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:10,295
ruining John Hill's business.

407
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,764
I saw him peeking out
the window.

408
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,399
I think he's ready
to make a deal.

409
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,833
How do you like my sign, huh?

410
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,169
"I broke a tooth
at Melville's.

411
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,138
Ask me how."

412
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,508
That's a very scary
little spider

413
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,842
holding the tooth
there, Sam.

414
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,346
That's, uh,
that's a crab actually.

415
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,384
Crab.

416
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,053
Well, looks like a spider.

417
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,421
You know, a lot
of people said that,

418
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,889
so I ended up
changing the story.

419
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,524
I told 'em, that
there was this outbreak

420
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,359
of poisonous spiders up
at Melville's.

421
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,061
It scared the hell out of 'em.

422
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,265
Sam?

423
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,533
Stay for this.
This should be fun.

424
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,001
Yes, John?

425
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,669
Let's get down
to brass tacks, Sam.

426
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,671
Absurd as it may sound,

427
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,039
you and your scary spider...

428
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,374
That's a crab. Crab.

429
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,608
Forgive me.

430
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,078
You and your scary crab

431
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,080
are driving
my customers away,

432
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,581
so let's settle this
right now.

433
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,917
I'll pay for your dental
bill and add,

434
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,319
say, uh, $500 in cash.

435
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,357
It's a deal.

436
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,991
(chuckles)

437
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,529
(coughing)

438
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,865
You all right, man?

439
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,034
There's a rock
in your pretzel dish, Sam.

440
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,502
That is deliberate
negligence.

441
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,937
Oh, it is not!

442
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,239
Come on, man,
you put that there. I...

443
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,875
Wha...

444
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,781
A picture is worth
a thousand words, Sam.

445
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,758
(applause)
Thank you.

446
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,926
Uh, now for the final performer
this evening,

447
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,763
let's put our hands together
for the merry mailman,

448
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,265
Cliff Clavin.

449
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,933
Come on,
put 'em together.

450
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,935
Hey.
Oh, yeah, thanks.

451
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,206
Uh, hi ya!

452
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,275
So, uh,

453
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Boston audiences are the
greatest audiences in the world.

454
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,151
Uh, you know,
I got this friend, uh,

455
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,219
whose son is gonna
become a priest.

456
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,954
I know where this is going.

457
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,090
"My son, the father."

458
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,259
What's up with that?

459
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,630
I never thought I'd see
a whole roomful of people

460
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,665
not laughing at Cliff.

461
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:30,402
Well, hey, let's see what topics
we got in the ol' mailbag, huh?

462
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,739
Hey, oh, uh, here's one.

463
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:37,509
Uh, anybody have a chance
to call a TV repairman lately?

464
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,313
What's up with that?

465
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,982
(chuckles)
Here's a doozy.

466
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,485
Avon lady... ding dong.

467
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,254
What's up with that?

468
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,958
Well, that's
it for me.

469
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,795
Well, I know, uh,

470
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,831
seriously, folks,
on-on a serious note

471
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,833
I just want to say...

472
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,836
drinking and driving.

473
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,272
What's up with that?

474
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,975
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

475
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,210
I've really enjoyed it, uh,

476
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,078
and I gotta say
this is the most love

477
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,747
I've ever felt in one room
in my life.

478
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,148
Thank you. Thank you.

479
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,491
Normie, where'd
everybody go?

480
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,495
There was a, uh,
bomb scare.

481
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,897
Really?

482
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:32,998
Where?

483
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,800
Right about
where you were standing.

484
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,412
Oh, hey, Cliff.

485
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,080
How'd it go at the club?

486
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,415
Daffynition.

487
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,384
Cliff Clavin: Stand-up comic.

488
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,486
(laughs)

489
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,155
It's not a joke,
Lilith.

490
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,890
That was my pain.
(laughs)

491
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,525
Oh, the topper.

492
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,360
Excuse me,

493
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,362
I have to go
compose myself.

494
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,200
Well, Cliff, I guess you had
to learn the hard way.

495
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,469
But you know,
maybe stand-up comedy

496
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,504
is just something
you don't have a knack for.

497
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,605
Yeah.

498
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,673
I don't know.

499
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,342
I can't figure out
what went wrong.

500
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,010
I mean, the material
was gangbusters.

501
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,078
I wrote it myself.

502
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,047
Must have been
the audience.

503
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,384
What's up with that?

504
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,418
(chuckling):
See?

505
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,087
I still got it.

506
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,559
Carla, doesn't
that hurt?

507
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,594
Yeah, but I
deserve it.

508
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,563
I'm atoning.

509
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,399
I thought of walking
on hot coals,

510
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,835
and I thought of sleeping
on a bed of nails,

511
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:46,372
but nothing I think of
seems like enough.

512
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,341
I just got to think of some way
to punish myself

513
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,644
that no human being has ever
done before.

514
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,813
Oh, hey, I got
it, Becs.

515
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,783
All I have to do is
find somebody to
sit down with me,

516
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:00,252
you know, like a personal
audience, and I'll
go over my routine,

517
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,487
you know, over
and over again,

518
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,323
a hundred times or so
until I nail it down.

519
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,424
Huh?

520
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,426
Any volunteers?

521
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,770
You really play hardball,
don't you?
