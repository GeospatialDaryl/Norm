Hey, Cliffie.
Hey, Norm.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,339
How's your day?
Oh, boring.

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,807
Nothing happens in
this burg anymore.

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,442
I know what you mean.
I am bored.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,543
Ooh, ooh,
look at that.

7
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,811
Look what
we got here.
What?

8
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,513
Look.

9
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,515
Oh, it's the film critic
at Channel 11.

10
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,251
No, it's the anchorman
at Channel Eight.

11
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,654
You want to,
uh... autograph?
Yeah, yeah.

Uh, excuse me.

Hey.

Yeah.
Oh, well.

18
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,830
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

19
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,032
Uh, here,

20
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,433

to write on.
Need a pen?

21
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,201
Yeah.
A full-service
autograph.

22
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,536

23
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,405
Oh, yeah.
You know, I love that, uh,

24
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,040
that report you did
on that train wreck.

00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,323
REBECCA:
Hey, everybody!

62
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,526
I have the most wonderful news.

63
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,560
You got a job?

64
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,762
I have a job.
Oh.

65
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,830
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,131
I confused
having a job

67
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,100
with being paid
to actually do something.

68
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,969
It spins just the same,
Carla.

69
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,438
I just got

70
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,772
<i>a call from Redbook magazine,</i>

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,574
and I have been selected

72
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,576
as one of the six Boston
businesswomen

73
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,579
to get a full beauty
makeover.

74
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,315
And the final results will
be in their next issue.

75
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,117
Oh, that's too bad.

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,785
<i>I always liked
Redbook.</i>

77
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,222
Rebecca, I can't possibly think

78
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,257
why you would need a makeover.

79
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,625
You're always
impeccably dressed.

80
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,760
You're constantly

81
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,162
alluring
without being overstated.

82
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,164
Well, thank you, Frasier.

83
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:23,168
Your eye makeup gives you
a certain feline quality.

84
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,170
It's irresistible.
Mm.

85
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,673
And I can't see how anyone
could possibly improve

86
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,675
on the way your hair cascades
down your face

87
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,677
in that peekaboo fashion.

88
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,913
Much like my own darling
Lilith.

89
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,150
Speak of the devil!

90
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,985
Not that you're a
devil, of course.

91
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,987
Just, uh, the
total opposite.

92
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,989
In fact, you're the
complete opposite
of the devil.

93
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,492
You're i.e.,
an angel.

94
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,161
There's no need
to be nervous, Frasier.

95
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,496
It's perfectly
natural for you

96
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,164
to be attracted
to other women.

97
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,833
It shows you have a,
a healthy sex drive.

98
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,835
I'm attracted
to other men.

99
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,971
Oh, no, not this
game again.

100
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,473
Let's see,
where shall I begin?

101
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,812
Yowsa!

102
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,947
<i>So Miss Howe's gonna
be in Redbook.</i>

103
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,115
Well, what is that?

104
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,383
Some kind of fashion
magazine?

105
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,618
Oh, no, no.

106
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,487
It's, uh, more than a fashion
magazine, Woody.

107
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,755
It, it's about
today's women.

108
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,257
You know, who they are,

109
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,425
uh, their wants,
their needs.

110
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,827
<i>Cliffie, you read Redbook?</i>

111
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,796
I don't so much
as read it, Norm.

112
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,165
I, uh, I do take some
of the quizzes, though.

113
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,601
Would you believe

114
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,004
that I'm actually
autumn complected?

115
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,007
Hey, guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

116
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,142
Gary sold
The Olde Towne Tavern.

117
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,143
No!
Get out!

118
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,144
SAM:
No kidding.

119
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,979
He sold it
to this guy named Frank.

120
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,915
Uh, runs a bunch of bars
in other cities.

121
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,083
He's already in.

122
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,317
Wait a minute.
This means that

123
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,786
any bar tab run
under the previous management

124
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,254
would automatically be null
and void, right?

125
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,191
You have a bar tab at Gary's?

126
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,692
Not anymore, Sam.

127
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,863
Oh, no more Gary's?

128
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,399
I can't believe that!

129
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,401
You know, in a way,
I'm gonna really
miss that guy.

130
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,669
Miss him?
You kidding me?
Yeah.

131
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,404
Worst thing
that ever happened to me.

132
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,306
I've never been happier
to see a guy go.

133
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,574
Aw, come on, Sam.

134
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,775
Nah, he was terrible.

135
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:10,909
He even turned
you guys,

136
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,244
my good friends,
against me.

137
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,812
Huh?
You remember
Halloween?

138
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Oh.
When you
convinced me

139
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:15,948
that I killed
the man?

140
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,850
Ha ha.
(laughs)

141
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,020
Yeah, you hate to see
the great ones retire.

142
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,022
Boy, without Gary,
what's left for us, huh?

143
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,457
So, huh,
what do you think?

144
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,893
You ready to start a rivalry
with the, uh, new bar?

145
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,061
What are you talking
about?

146
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,262
Yeah.
Come on.

147
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,764
It's a golden opportunity.

148
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,298
We can win this time.

149
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,300
We can steal
all of Gary's best ideas

150
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,869
and use 'em
against this new guy.

151
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,704
And you remember how Gary's
always going first?

152
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,872
We can learn
from that.

153
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,874
We can move first
ourselves.

154
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,075
Very good, Sam.

155
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,777
As that famous
prankster

156
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,612
Santayana
once said,

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,447
"Those who do not
learn from history

158
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,948
are condemned
to repeat it."

159
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,950
You got that right,
Doctor Crane.

160
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,552
Back in high school
I was condemned

161
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,554
to repeat History three times.

162
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,958
By the way, the same goes
for Mathematics.

163
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,095
Come on, come on.

164
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,730
What do you say
we show this Frank guy

165
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:05,964
there's another bar
in town?

166
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,766
Do we really want to
let ourselves in

167
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,134
for that kind of
humiliation again?

168
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,570
Sure!

169
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,238
Oh, no, no, Sam,
I think Normie's right.

170
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,840
I mean, if there's one thing
Gary taught us

171
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,643
it's that we're nothing
but a bunch of losers.

172
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,945
Yeah, but the new guys
don't know that.

173
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,747
Well, let's show 'em,
huh?

174
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,749
Yeah!

175
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,090
Okay, I'll be
right back.

176
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,424
Okay.
(gasps)

177
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,093
Look at me!
Lilith, look at me!

178
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,928
Isn't this
exciting?
Yes.

179
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,931
Every so often people
need to recreate
themselves.

180
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,934
And frequently the
metamorphosis has very
positive results.

181
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,269
You should've seen

182
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,605
what I looked like
back in my college days.

183
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,640
Bowwow!

184
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,978
So, Rebecca, you're having
a makeover, huh?

185
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,313
Yes.

186
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,281
You know, uh, I don't
understand. I mean,

187
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,550
if there was ever a person
who didn't need a makeover,

188
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,818
it's you.

189
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,453
I think you're perfect
just the way you are.

190
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,023
Oh, well, thank you, Paul.

191
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,025
Boobs, too, or just the face?

192
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,463
Just the face.

193
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,499
Eh.

194
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,838
(Norm chuckles)

195
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,275
I assume you've
just come

196
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,010
from the new Olde
Towne Tavern.

197
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,645
Yeah, we went for an
often used stunt,

198
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,313
but one that's sure
to bring a smile.

199
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,182
(laughs)
We teepeed the whole
front of the place.

200
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,550
And how will they know

201
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,719
that you're the dastardly
ones that did the deed?

202
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,054
LILITH:
Good question.

203
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,157
Could have been the Mensa
chapter from M.I.T.

204
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,159
Ah, we soaped their windows

205
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,027
"Regards from your friends
at Cheers."

206
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,228
NORM:
Yeah, and I threw
a few packs

207
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,531
of "Cheers" matches with
our address in there.

208
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,801
I stuck my head in the door
and yelled, "Cheers rules!"

209
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:49,968
SAM:
Yeah, if they

210
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,136
can't figure that out,

211
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,005
they're the stupidest
bar in town.

212
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,707
Ooh, I wouldn't go
that far, Sam.

213
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,608
So all we got to
do now is, uh,

214
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,877
sit back and see what
these guys are made out of.

215
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,212
Yeah, I can't wait
to see

216
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,881
what weenie retaliation
Frank comes up with, huh?

217
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,451
Yeah, yeah, it'll be
the standard novice stuff.

218
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,152
You know, rubber rat
behind the bar

219
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,754
or something.
Yeah, stealing the
sign out front.

220
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,356
Having 20 pizzas
delivered.

221
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,623
Oh!
Yeah, whatever
it is,

222
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,092
there won't be any imagination
connected to it.

223
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,393
These guys are rookies.

224
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,561
They'll just come up
with something pathetic.

225
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,096
(explosion)

226
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,198
(loud thudding)

227
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,336
Well, we better get this
cleaned up

228
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,904
before the pizza arrives.

229
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,018
I'm here to take some
pictures of the wreckage.

230
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,053
Oh, she's way
over there.

231
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,560
<i>So, uh, you're a Redbook
photographer, huh?
Mm-hmm.</i>

232
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,929
How'd you manage to land
this assignment?

233
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,931
Mouthed off to one
of the editors.

234
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,868
OFFICER:
So, uh, Mr. Malone,

235
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,736
do you have any idea
who could have done this?

236
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,971
Yeah, I do.

237
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,306
The new owner of Gary's
Olde Towne Tavern.

238
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,975
A guy named Frank.

239
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,810
See, what happened is we
went over, you know,

240
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,145
in the spirit of
gamesmanship,

241
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,213
and I gave him the old welcome
to the neighborhood.

242
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,248
Teepeed their bar.

243
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,716
FRASIER:
Yeah, we considered

244
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,918
plastic explosives
on their front door,

245
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,254
but thought, "Nah,
too funny."

246
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,791
Do you have any idea who
you're dealing with here?

247
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,858
What do you mean?

248
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,794
How do I explain it
to you? Um,

249
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,796
this guy Frank is
kind of "connected,"

250
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,064
if you know what I mean.

251
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,066
Wow, he wears a pacemaker?

252
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,200
Oh, now I really

253
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,535
feel bad.

254
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,570
No, no, you don't
understand.

255
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,339
His full name is Frank

256
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,507
"The Angel of Death"
Carpaccio.

257
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,842
This guy's associated

258
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,677
with some very bad
individuals.

259
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,745
You're kidding me!

260
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,213
I'm afraid not.

261
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,614
Oh, my God!

262
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,850
We just teepeed
a mob bar.

263
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,218
If you want,
Mr. Malone,

264
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,920
I suppose you can
press charges.

265
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,922
Of course, I saw some
pictures of people

266
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,091
who pressed charges
against Mr. Carpaccio

267
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,926
and his associates
on different occasions.

268
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,829
It turned my stomach.

269
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,398
<i>Wait'll you get next
month's Redbook.</i>

270
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,969
Uh, look,

271
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,237
it'd probably
be a good idea

272
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,306
to just let the whole thing
rest, you know what I mean?

273
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,374
Yeah, thanks, yeah.
Oh,

274
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,775
uh, one other thing.

275
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,910
Uh, we're not gonna
be much help to you here.

276
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,912
You see, uh, we're all scared
of the guy,

277
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,915
and we pretty much let him
do whatever he wants.

278
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,287
Boy, I feel safer with
those guys around.

279
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,756
Oh, holy mother!

280
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,224
What have we done?

281
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,026
Oh, come on.
We didn't know, Carla.

282
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,327
You don't understand, Sam.

283
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,928
This is not gonna end here.

284
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,930
I mean, these guys are new
in town.

285
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,066
They're gonna want to make
examples of all of us.

286
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,601
If I may interject,

287
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,670
<i>I think you've all seen too
many Godfather movies.</i>

288
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,772
I agree.
Should have stopped at two.

289
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,808
That notwithstanding,

290
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,176
I don't think
we should

291
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,544
run off in a
panic here.

292
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,979
Don't you see what
we're doing?

293
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,480
We're stereotyping
these people

294
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,416
and letting our irrational
fears convince us

295
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,384
that they intend to
do us bodily harm

296
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,386
in some cold-blooded
fashion.

297
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,055
Now, with that said,

298
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,724
I will bid you all a
fond adieu for a
couple of weeks.

299
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,392
Lilith,

300
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,394
Frederick and I are
going on vacation.

301
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,229
What are you
talking about?

302
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,664
Oh, don't you
remember

303
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,533
that trip we talked
about, dear?
We didn't plan a trip.

304
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,168
Oh, it'll all come back
to you in the cab.

305
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,869
Let's go.
Come on.
But I need
my briefcase.

306
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,705
No, leave it, woman!
Move!
Oh!

307
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,106
CARLA:
Look, Sam,

308
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,541
I know these people.
Okay?

309
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,810
I mean, it's one thing
to be into them for money.

310
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,478
They got a sense
of humor about that.

311
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,746
But it's another
thing

312
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,181
to humiliate them
like we did.

313
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,782
I mean, they're not
gonna forget about this.

314
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,117
Oh, you know,
Carla's right.

315
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,719
The only thing
we can do is

316
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,887
go over and apologize to Frank

317
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,390
"The Angel of Death"
Carpaccio.
Nah, Cliffie,

318
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,491
that's not gonna do it.

319
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,460
We have to go over there
and beg like dogs.

320
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,894
Okay.
SAM:
Oh, no, wait a second,

321
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,029
wait a second.
NORM:
What?

322
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,297
I just had
a thought here.

323
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,199
What?
Who would like
to see us beg

324
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,634
more than anyone else
in the whole world?

325
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,003
Sammy, you don't suppose

326
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,604
Vera's behind this
whole thing, do you?

327
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,575
No, I'm talking
about Gary.

328
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,776
Gary?
Yeah.

329
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,745
What do you mean?
Well, think about it.

330
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,880
I mean, the guy sells his bar
and disappears.

331
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,449
The guy who buys it all of
a sudden moves in instantly.

332
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,251
I mean, come on,
we're being set up.

333
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,452
We're a bunch
of suckers.

334
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,254
You think?
Yeah.

335
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,655
Remember Halloween?

336
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,457
The guy crawled
into a coffin, you know,

337
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,492
and pretended
to be dead

338
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,627
just to scare
the bejeebers out of me.

339
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,928
(Woody laughing)

340
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,964
Yeah, I'm glad we
got that on tape.

341
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,065
(laughing)

342
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,367
You got that
on tape?

343
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,804
I'm talking
out of turn.

344
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,106
I-I-I get this,
I get this.

345
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,410
You mean, we go over to Gary's
crying like babies,

346
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,279
and Gary jumps out of the wall
laughing his head off.

347
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,715
How many times does Gary have
to make us look like jerks

348
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,316
before we wise up, huh?

349
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,551
Well, you know,
there's some things

350
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,319
you just can't
put a number on.

351
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,355
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it now.

352
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,490
You mean when all
is said and done,

353
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,160
at the end of this, I'm still
going to have a tab at Gary's?

354
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,995
Yes, Norm.

355
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,630
That bastard,
let's get him.

356
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,265
I got an idea.

357
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,133
Why don't we just play along
with this, huh?

358
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,870
Why don't we go over there
and, uh, "apologize?"

359
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,906
Yeah, I see what you mean.

360
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,008
We apologize to him.

361
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,209
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right,

362
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,244
apologize in a big way.

363
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,512
ALL:
Yeah.

364
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,950
Apologize like he's never been
apologized to before.

365
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:05,951
ALL:
Yeah.

366
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,453
This is great.

367
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,754
What are we doing?

368
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,825
I'll explain it
to you later, Woody.

369
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,061
Yeah, well, uh, can we keep
talking in these voices?

370
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,396
Hey, Mr. Krapence,

371
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,933
tell Miss Howe we'll be back
after a while.

372
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,547
Boy, every time I set foot
in this place,

373
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,882
it gives me the creeps.

374
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,350
ALL:
Norm!

375
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,021
How do they know you in here?

376
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,789
Hey, Sammy closes
on Christmas morning.

377
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,591
Okay?

378
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,194
Excuse me, uh, is
Mr. Carpaccio around?

379
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,398
Oh, Gary went all the way,
didn't he?

380
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,432
Look at that guy.

381
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,769
Dark shirt,
shiny suit, jewelry.

382
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,239
If you want to get a girl,
you got to know how to dress.

383
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,743
Uh, fellas?

384
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,580
Excuse me, uh,
Mr. Carpaccio?

385
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:09,982
Yeah, what is it?

386
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,851
My name's Sam
Malone, sir.

387
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,053
We're from Cheers.

388
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,189
Oh, yeah.

389
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,758
You're a bunch of funny guys
over there, aren't you?

390
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,896
Uh, yeah, about that, sir,
we're here to apologize.

391
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,564
You are?

392
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,266
Oh, yes, sir,
you see, uh,

393
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,768
we had this kind
of friendly rivalry

394
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,337
with the previous
owner, Gary,

395
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,005
and, you know, we
just thought we'd try

396
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,040
to start a little something
with you, that's all.

397
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,375
We didn't mean
any harm by it.

398
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,676
Well, Mr. Malone,

399
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,245
I appreciate your coming
down here to tell me this.

400
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,580
Shows you got respect.

401
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:42,748
I didn't scare you

402
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,116
too much, did I?

403
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,384
(laughs)

404
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,154
Yes, sir,
you know,

405
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,190
it'll take much more
than an exploding door

406
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,925
to, uh, scare off
Clifford Clavin.

407
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,026
Well, what
about that clown

408
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,796
at the car wash?

409
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,765
I'm a little bit frightened
of clowns, okay?

410
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,633
It's normal.

411
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,369
Well, the incident is forgotten;
it never happened.

412
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,803
Thank you
very much.

413
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,472
Now, that's a load off
our minds, isn't it?
Yeah.

414
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,142
Say, you're the, uh,

415
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,244
barmaid over there,
aren't you, at Cheers?

416
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,179
Yeah, I am.
Hey,

417
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,415
you know,
we need a new one over here.

418
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,251
We had one, but, uh,
she was a big blabbermouth.

419
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,486
(laughs)

420
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,656
Sorry, I got a job.

421
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:25,991
SAM:
Actually, you know,
we were thinking,

422
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,093
this being a new business
and all, we thought,

423
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,496
you know, maybe you could
use a few extra customers.

424
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,464
Just to show you
we're not, uh,

425
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,933
having any hard feelings here,
we thought

426
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,535
we'd fill the
place up for you.

427
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,972
You know who's really
a thirsty bunch, Sam?

428
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Firemen.

429
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,342
Oh, that's a good idea,
firemen.

430
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,344
Now, how can we get
firemen in here in a hurry?

431
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,514
You just leave it
to me.

432
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,515
(alarm ringing)

433
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,522
How's that, Gary,
wet enough for you?

434
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,290
ALL:
# Singing in the rain... #

435
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,959
CARPACCIO:
Hey, what the hell is this?!

436
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,362
You people don't know
who you're fooling around with!

437
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,963
You're dead!

438
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,198
You're dead,
do you hear me?

439
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,967
Your family-- dead!

440
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,736
Your friends-- dead!

441
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,538
Your pets-- dead!

442
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,807
Dead, dead, dead!

443
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,444
(door opens)

444
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,615
Well, I understand
congratulations are in order.

445
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,750
You beat Gary
at his own game.

446
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,218
Gee, I...

447
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,721
wish I could have been there
with you when you did it.

448
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,190
Well, maybe you could have
if you hadn't run out of here

449
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,492
with your tail
between your legs.

450
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,827
Well, Carla, in my profession

451
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,462
we encourage people
to go with their feelings,

452
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,863
and at that time my feelings

453
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:41,166
were stark, gibbering terror
and borderline incontinence.

454
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,169
Oh, that's all right,
Dr. Crane, we all get scared.

455
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,437
For example,
when Mr. Clavin

456
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,439
sees that clown
outside the car wash,

457
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,842
he starts screaming
at the top of his lungs.

458
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,411
I got a phobia, okay?

459
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,846
Let me tell you a story here

460
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:54,880
about a sweet little
eight-year-old

461
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,215
called Cliff Clavin.

462
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,151
On his eighth birthday,
his ma hires a clown.

463
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,586
Great idea, right?

464
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,588
Except for one thing.

465
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,356
None of the other kids show up.

466
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,595
So here I am with this clown
for five hours.

467
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,632
Just me and him,
back and forth--

468
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,435
"Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah."

469
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,370
I keep screaming,
"Enough, enough,"

470
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,340
but, no, Ma wanted
to get her money's worth.

471
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,341
(door opens)

472
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,544
Excuse me,
are you Sam Malone?

473
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,545
Yeah,

474
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,813
what can I do
for you?

475
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,981
I'm Inspector Hanson.

476
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,416
Agent Carmichael, FBI.

477
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,118
We have some business with you
regarding a Frank Carpaccio.

478
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,953
Oh, man, Gary doesn't give up,
does he?

479
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,288
(laughs)

480
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:40,959
How do we, uh, know you
gentlemen are from the FBI, huh?

481
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,229
Yeah, yeah.

482
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,998
That's the real McCoy,
all right, Sammy.

483
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,267
It's not like the one I got
down at the mall.

484
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,503
We've been conducting
an investigation

485
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,005
into the activities
of Mr. Carpaccio,

486
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,673
also known
as "The Angel of Death."

487
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,575
Well, wait a minute.
What are you telling me?

488
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,410
Are you telling me this guy's
a legitimate criminal?

489
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,512
I've spent five years in court
trying to prove that.

490
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,814
Only every time I get close,

491
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,515
my star witness ends up
in some warehouse

492
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,783
dangling from a meat hook.

493
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,251
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,

494
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,854
but I'm wasting
precious vacation time.

495
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,255
CARMICHAEL:
Anyway, yesterday evening,

496
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,057
we made a recording
of a conversation

497
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,259
in which Mr. Carpaccio
threatened you, Mr. Malone,

498
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,328
along with several other
unidentified people,

499
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,430
whose lives
are all in danger now.

500
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,699
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

501
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,501
Wait a minute.
What does this have
to do with us?

502
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,169
Well, we'd like all of you
to testify

503
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,270
against Mr. Carpaccio
in court.

504
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,739
Excuse me.

505
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,441
What? What are
you doing?

506
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,909
Look, if I can get to confession
fast enough,

507
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,878
maybe I can get capped
in a state of grace.

508
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,546
Carla, come on,
that's not gonna help.

509
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,349
Look, Sam, they want us to sing
against this guy in court, okay?

510
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,784
We'll all be dead.

511
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,919
Us?
What about our pets?

512
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,521
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

513
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,689
What are we gonna do?

514
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,057
It's all your fault,
Peterson.
What?

515
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,126
You're the one
who wanted us
to go back there.

516
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,794
Yeah, but Carla pulled
the damn fire alarm!

517
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,062
Hey, don't blame me!

518
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,730
Sam's the one who made us buy
the umbrellas.

519
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,832
Hey, Norm choreographed
the stupid number!

520
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,674
It took a team
of four men 12 hours,

521
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,609
but I think I'm worth it.

522
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:04,710
What do you think?

523
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,345
About what?

524
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,048
About me!
About the new way I look.

525
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,616
Hey, honey, we're a
little busy right now.

526
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,017
Do you mind?

527
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,752
I mean, we just found out
that we insulted a mob boss

528
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,054
and he's threatened
to kill us.

529
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,755
We could be in a little bit
of trouble right now.

530
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,592
But I'm blonde. See?

531
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,327
You don't get it,
do you, Rebecca?

532
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,630
This isn't a game.
We could all get killed.

533
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,433
Yeah, but look.
Even my roots are blonde.

534
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,768
Rebecca, would you just shut up
for a second, please?

535
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,103
All right, fine.

536
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,740
I'll just go show people
who are less self-absorbed.

537
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:40,079
Hey, everybody, look at me!
Look at me!

538
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,514
Listen, people,
we've got to act
quickly here.

539
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,683
We're moving in on Carpaccio
sometime during the week.

540
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,186
In the meantime, we'll have
to relocate all of you

541
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,220
until he's safely
behind bars.

542
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,788
We have to get
moving right away.

543
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,889
There's a bus outside.

544
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,458
What about my kids?

545
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,560
Well, we'll assign an agent
to take care of them.

546
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,594
Will he have a gun?

547
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,628
Oh, yes, he will.

548
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,564
Then he's got a fighting chance.

549
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,666
Let's go, people!

550
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,470
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute. I'm not going.

551
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,637
What do you mean?

552
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,872
Listen, this is,
this is my whole life.

553
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,741
You know, I've worked too long
and too hard

554
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,043
to give up everything
that's important to me.

555
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,212
You're taking
quite a risk, Mr. Malone.

556
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,481
I-I can't live my life in fear.

557
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,349
Well, we all can.
And time's a-wasting.

558
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,484
Let's go.

559
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,818
Hold it, hold it.

560
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,587
If Sam's not going,
I'm not going either.

561
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,255
What?

562
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,456
Oh, Woody, wait a second.

563
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,058
I, I can't let you
take that risk.

564
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,893
As long
as you understand, Sam.

565
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,561
Let's make tracks, folks.

566
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,514
This is it?

567
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,449
Where's the agent
supposed to meet us?

568
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,118
Maybe we'd better get back
on the bus, huh?

569
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,119
Hey. Hey!

570
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,287
Whoa! Whoa!

571
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,925
The last bus of the day.

572
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:00,926
Swell.

573
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,394
I'm freezing.

574
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,562
I'm hungry.

575
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,930
I'm thirsty.

576
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,932
Guy wouldn't let me
take my beer on the bus.

577
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,033
Yeah, we know that,
Norm.

578
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,802
You only said it
about a thousand times.

579
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:10,836
Well, he wouldn't.

580
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:11,904
(phone rings)

581
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,340
Must be the agent.

582
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,276
Hello?

583
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,911
Carla, hi!

584
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:19,912
Sam?

585
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:20,913
How you doing?

586
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,448
Terrible!

587
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,149
We're stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere,

588
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,151
waiting for someone
to pick us up.

589
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,720
You're all alone?

590
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,288
Yeah, for about 200 miles.

591
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,457
Wow! Is it cold?

592
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,093
Yeah, Sam, I'm cold.
I'm freezing.

593
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,427
I'm thinking
about hugging Clavin.

594
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,131
Boy, what a shame.

595
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:42,668
Hey, listen, honey,
you remember, uh, last Halloween

596
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:45,971
when you guys pulled that
hilarious stunt on me

597
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,173
making me think
that Gary was dead

598
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,742
and that I was responsible
for it?

599
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,676
Yeah.

600
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,710
Well...

601
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,380
gotcha!

602
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,054
Now let me get
this straight, Sam.

603
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:05,024
This, this was all
your doing?

604
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,559
(laughing)

605
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,695
The exploding door
and all that damage

606
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,430
that you did
to your own bar?

607
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,664
(laughing)

608
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,300
The expense of paying
all the people involved?

609
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,603
The bus fare
to get your stooges

610
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,271
all the way out
to North Dakota?

611
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,373
It cost me a fortune!

612
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,208
I had to take out a loan!

613
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:24,910
(laughing)

614
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,413
I'll be paying it
off for ten years!

615
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,848
(laughing)

616
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,285
Well, I guess the joke
certainly is on them, isn't it?

617
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,957
CLIFF:
Boy, he really rubbed our noses
in it, didn't he?

618
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,592
CARLA:
You got to love the guy.

619
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,227
NORM:
I'm a better person
just knowing him.

620
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,897
WOODY:
Well, at least out here
we're safe from that mob guy.

621
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,699
NORM:
No, no, Woody.

622
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,834
Let me explain it to you
one more time.
