1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,391
AN AMERlCAN FAMlLY

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,192
- Could l have some suds, Coach?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,558
Normie, how's it going?
You got Vera pregnant yet?

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,589
Not yet.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,833
What's up? lt's been a few months.
l'm a little disappointed.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,468
l'm doing my darnedest.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,155
- Anything to get Vera off my back.
- Your back?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,596
l think l see a little problem
with your technique.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,877
Coach, can l have a pencil
and a large piece of paper?

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,033
Anyone see Orosco
hit a homer last night?

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,550
- What a fluke. A relief pitcher.
- Unbelievable.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,077
- Sammy, what kind of hitter were you?
- l remember hitting 21 1 one year.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,674
ln your dreams.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,751
One Scotch rocks, please.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,710
- l don't think you ever hit over 1 50.
- Wait, l got 20 bucks says he did.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,793
- You're on, sucker.
- Kiss that Andrew Jackson goodbye.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,270
lt's beyond me why you insist
on making a contest

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,635
out of the most meaningless issues.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,234
No, on the contrary, Diane.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,598
We also address ourselves to some
of the most vital issues of our times.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,231
For instance, if south-east Asia were
to be obliterated by a nuclear attack,

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,279
Norm would have to push a peanut
up Boylston Street with his nose.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,989
But only as far as the corner.
Come on, peace.

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,634
Hi, is this Pequod? This is Sam Malone.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,874
l'd like a reservation for two in one
of your cosier rooms for the weekend.

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,510
That's great.
l'll see you Friday night, late.

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,235
- l heard you mention the Pequod.
- Yeah, that's right.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,598
That wouldn't be that charming little inn
that you and l went to last fall?

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,957
l'm sorry. l didn't think.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,192
- This is gonna bother you, isn't it?
- Of course not.

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,956
What you do now is your own concern.
Take a different woman every night.

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,238
Actually, it's easier
to have them meet me there.

33
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,035
lt's gonna bug you, me going there
with somebody else, isn't it?

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,758
Not at all.

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,718
This is bugging the hell out of you.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,792
l tell you what, l'll go someplace else.
l understand.

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,511
Don't be ridiculous. lt doesn't bug me,
as you so eloquently put it.

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,558
Yeah? Would you take Frasier there?

39
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,031
ln fact, Frasier and l have been to
several places you and l frequented.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,236
lt's refreshing to go out with someone

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,551
who doesn't slide across
museum floors in their socks.

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,878
Those paintings look a lot better
if you go by fast.

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,750
Anyway, l'll make sure they don't put me
in the same room at the Pequod.

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,956
l could care less.

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,519
Room number 1 2.

46
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,072
That was a great room, 1 2.

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,879
Remember when
that nor'easter blew through,

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,237
and we had to stay inside
by that big old fireplace?

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,833
Yeah.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,199
We listened to the wind lashing against
the panes, the rain on the roof.

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,229
- Huddled under that big comforter.
- l never felt safer.

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,391
Me neither.

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,316
- You weren't there, Coach.
- l thought you meant now.

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,391
Sam, please.

55
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Go, have a good time.

56
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,592
- Just don't do anything l wouldn't do.
- l'm afraid l've lost that list.

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,829
l remember you.
You're that blonde waitress.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,390
And you're Carla's incredibly
loathsome ex-husband.

59
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,040
So we both stuck in each other's minds.

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,919
Sit down. You want anything?

61
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,993
- Thanks. l'll have a Coke.
- Be sophisticated. We're in a bar.

62
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,673
Coca Cola.

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,718
No, no. Order some kind of drink.

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,030
l'd like something in a coconut.

65
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,510
You're something in a coconut.
Two Scotches.

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,989
Nick, this is a surprise.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,550
How you doing, Sam?
You dumped Carla by now?

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,110
We're no longer going together,
but Carla dumped me.

69
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,996
She dumped you? Sam, you boggle me.

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,755
Wait a second.
l did dump that blonde waitress there.

71
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,038
Nick!

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,192
- What the hell do you want?
- Hey!

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,309
- ls that the kind of hello l deserve?
- No, bend over and l'll give it to you.

74
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,153
l gotta talk to you.
l would have come by the house,

75
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,915
but l didn't want Loretta
to see my humble beginnings.

76
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,672
l need a favour.

77
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,310
Unless it's setting your eyebrows on fire,
forget it.

78
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,199
- l used to drive you crazy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,954
l came because l want a kid.

80
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,631
Shouldn't you be baking your biscuits
in blondie's oven now?

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,992
l'm talking about one of ours,
the fruit of my loins.

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,118
Would you like to use my office,
for a little privacy?

83
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,635
- No.
- Please.

84
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,711
- What's this about?
- As you know,

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,270
l'm now married to the goddess
- compared to you - Loretta.

86
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,790
She can't have kids
and it's breaking her heart.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,239
l don't want anybody thinking it's my fault
so l figured l'd take one of our old ones.

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,192
You want me to give you
and that twinkie one of my children?

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,318
- Product of my seed.
- Please, please.

90
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,268
- This is outrageous, even for you.
- What's the big deal? You got five.

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,069
Carla, don't let this recidivist
strong-arm you.

92
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,789
There is no bond greater
than that of mother and child.

93
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,232
He's talking of your babies.
The issue of your womb.

94
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,073
Would anyone mind
if l went into my office?

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,519
Carla, see reason.

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,708
Take out an ad in the paper.
You never know what the kid'll look like,

97
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,519
but l can't believe you'd be fussy.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,753
What is this, ''Days of Our Lives''?

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,150
l want my own, not somebody else's.

100
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,550
Mind your own businesses.

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,513
l didn't think you'd be cold-hearted,
but as you are,

102
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,990
l have to do
what l'm trying to avoid at all costs.

103
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,879
- Breathe through your nose?
- No.

104
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,110
l'm taking you to court.

105
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,236
- You can't do that.
- No?

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,109
My attorney assures me
that l got a very good case.

107
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,398
ln fact, he thinks l can get all five kids
and you as a maid.

108
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,430
l'm letting you off easy.

109
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,990
Tom, you're a lawyer. Can he do this?

110
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,436
Family law is not my specialty.
However...

111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,639
Wait, hold on there,
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,633
What is your specialty,
blowing the bar exam?

113
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,190
l'm gonna pass it this time.
Don't you worry about it.

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,636
l won't. You've taken it
in every state in New England.

115
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,429
This is a man who thinks
affidavit's a Jewish wine.

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,192
lf he knows anything,
he knows more than you.

117
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,351
- Thanks.
- Go on, Tom.

118
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,033
We can't wait.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,797
There's a chance he could get custody,
if he can prove you're an unfit mother.

120
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,350
Thank you, Counsellor. And who
do you think they're gonna pick?

121
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,878
Me, a sincere, hard-working family man?
Or you, a hard-up waitress,

122
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,191
who leaves her kids every night
to come to a sleazy bar?

123
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,194
- Watch it.
- Yeah, she's off Thursday nights.

124
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,030
l can also prove that you consort
with men of questionable character.

125
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,397
What do you mean?
You got the morals of a sewer rat.

126
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,596
Not to worry. lf you knew your law,

127
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,594
you'd know a thing in the Bill of Rights
called the double standard.

128
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,555
Watch the bureaucrats
take that away from us, too.

129
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,110
You're bluffing.
Court costs money, you know.

130
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,831
Unless TV repair has increased
dramatically, you make diddle.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,436
Every time you open your mouth,
you show your ignorance.

132
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,799
The Tortelli Television Hospital has just
come off a record-breaking quarter.

133
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,474
l'll tell you,
l got ten men working under me,

134
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,108
and two of them is American.

135
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,876
Even if l gave you those kids,
they wouldn't want to go with you.

136
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,272
The young ones don't know who you are,
the old ones hate your guts.

137
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,795
l don't believe this. Anthony loves me.

138
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,078
He's the oldest. He remembers you
walking out. He thinks you're a creep.

139
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,595
- He thinks l'm cool.
- Calls you scuzball.

140
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,514
- He didn't learn that from me.
- Didn't learn anything from you!

141
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,150
The nuclear testing range next door's
complaining.

142
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,313
Nick, we're gonna be late
for that Menudo concert.

143
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,479
Oh, yeah, Menudo.
l won the tickets on the radio.

144
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,710
What is it, anyway?

145
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,873
Go to your concert.
You ain't getting no kid of mine.

146
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,435
l know how to cut this short.

147
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,149
- l wanna talk to you alone.
- No. Forget about it.

148
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,880
l got nothing l wanna talk
to you about alone.

149
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,190
Just a little chat.

150
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,316
Between you and l.

151
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,831
Private matters.

152
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,909
Well...

153
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,675
OK. Sam, can we use your office?

154
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,877
Why? What secrets
could you possibly have left?

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,873
No, don't answer that. Use my office.

156
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,510
- Carla looked nervous going in there.
- Who wouldn't be?

157
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,276
Whenever Nick gets a woman alone,
he wraps them round his little finger.

158
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,318
Well, Carla's a pretty tough little nut.

159
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,710
lt'll take more than Nick can muster

160
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,159
to break the bond between
a mother and her first-born offspring.

161
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,754
Mommy! The kid is ours!

162
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,956
- Daddy!
- We're a family now.

163
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,317
- Let's stuff our faces till we get sick.
- Sounds good.

164
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,471
What are you all looking at?

165
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,955
Never seen a jellyfish before?

166
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,554
Normie, l hate to be the one
to tell you this.

167
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,235
But Sam's batting average
never went past 1 49.

168
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,550
- There's the stat book.
- 1 49.

169
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,757
That's right. l don't wanna be
the kind of guy who rubs it in,

170
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,151
so just let me say...

171
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,119
l have a little bad news for you.

172
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,477
l bet the Coach that if you won
you'd be obnoxious,

173
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,029
so l come out even.

174
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,349
Troops, l'm back! What's so funny?

175
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,308
Normie just lost a bundle
to Cliffie on a bet.

176
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,552
But the Coach just lost a bundle to me.

177
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,672
But the funniest thing is,

178
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,914
it's based on the fact that you
couldn't hit a baseball to save your life!

179
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,273
- Know what's even funnier than that?
- What?

180
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,230
Cliffie spent 30 bucks on a book
to win a 20 dollar bet.

181
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,793
Yeah? Well, you lent me the money.
You know l'll never pay it back.

182
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,030
You know, the way you revel
in each other's defeats

183
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,191
is totally reprehensible.

184
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,433
Are you ever as pleased
with each other's good fortune?

185
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,034
Who's had any?

186
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,319
Boy, l tell you, it's good to be home.

187
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,356
- How was the Pequod, Sam?
- Pequod?

188
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,034
Was it everything
you remembered it to be?

189
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,953
Diane, why torment yourself?

190
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,551
- So you really went?
- Of course.

191
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,110
Did you enjoy the fruit basket
Frasier and l sent to your room?

192
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,589
- Fruit basket?
- Yes, the fruit basket.

193
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,274
- The fruit basket?
- The fruit basket.

194
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,833
Yeah, OK, we loved the fruit basket.

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,436
- We didn't send a fruit basket.
- Damn! l knew it.

196
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,350
Your heart wouldn't let you
go to that place with another woman.

197
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,988
l find that very sweet.

198
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,515
- She won that one, didn't she?
- Not necessarily.

199
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,279
Hey, everybody.

200
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,078
- Hi, Carla.
- lsn't it a great day?

201
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,674
You know, as l got up this morning,

202
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,276
and l was feeding my four
- count them - four kids,

203
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,513
l said to myself,
''Carla, you are so lucky.

204
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,038
''Think of all those poor human beings
who have five or more kids.

205
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,077
''lnstead of just four like me.''

206
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,834
You don't even miss this kid at all?

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,991
l can't even remember his name.

208
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,197
- Anthony.
- My baby!

209
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,557
The one time l remember something!

210
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,793
lf you felt this way, why on earth
did you give that child away?

211
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,872
Because l could never say no
to that man.

212
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,830
l never even wanted
to go out with him in the first place.

213
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,911
He won me over.

214
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,470
l didn't wanna go to bed with him.
He won me over.

215
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,552
l didn't wanna marry him.
l didn't wanna have five kids.

216
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,759
Our whole history is me saying no
and him winning me over.

217
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,993
Like the other day in there?
He held my hand.

218
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,277
And he got real close to me,

219
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,432
and then he batted
those eyelashes at me.

220
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,197
He said, ''Carla, you know
why l want that kid?

221
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,275
''Cos he is a part of you.
He's the only part of you l have.''

222
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,076
- Nick said that?
- Let's not even discuss it.

223
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,472
lt's over, the kid is his. He's coming by
to have me sign the papers.

224
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,997
lf you don't wanna sign, don't sign.
Stand up to the guy.

225
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,109
l'll resist. But if l'm alone with him
for a second, l'll melt.

226
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,400
Then, as a simple solution, we shan't let
you alone with him. Right, everyone?

227
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,437
We shan't!

228
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,315
Let's get this signed and over with!

229
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,037
Carla, don't you have
something you wanna tell Nick?

230
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,470
Yeah. Yes, there is.

231
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,074
l am not signing that paper.

232
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,391
You can't have Anthony.
l don't care what you say.

233
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,313
l don't care what the courts say.
l want my kid back.

234
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,833
Yes!

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,957
You said Carla didn't
give a hoot for the kids.

236
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,997
There's a new development.

237
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,069
- l can't do this.
- What? What do you have to do?

238
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,873
l just realised that
Carla and l are both women.

239
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,313
And l can't do this to her.
l can't be a party to child stealing.

240
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,153
Are you crazy?
The kid's as much mine as hers.

241
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,596
l'm sorry. l refuse.

242
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,479
l've got to put my foot down
about something.

243
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,713
And when l make up my mind,
that's my final decision.

244
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,474
While you're thinking about it,

245
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,599
why don't we go into Sam's office
and have a private talk?

246
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,355
l don't think
that's going to work this time.

247
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,872
- Please?
- Well... OK.

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,794
- But it's a waste of time.
- We'll be right back.

249
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,475
You can keep talking
until you're blue in the face,

250
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,679
but it's not gonna change my mind,
you're not gonna...

251
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,238
Carla, sign the paper.

252
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,669
What is this?

253
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,150
Even a shot of vitamin Sammy
doesn't work that fast.

254
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,518
- Sign the paper.
- l won't.

255
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,274
- Sign it!
- Hang tough, Carla.

256
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,560
How about you and l
go into Sam's office

257
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,712
and have a private talk?

258
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,953
- Don't do it, Carla.
- Stay out here with us.

259
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,479
No, l have to go in there with him.

260
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,031
lf l can stand up to him this one time,

261
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,594
l can break his spell.

262
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,991
- And l think l can do it.
- You gotta know you can do it.

263
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,720
l think l can do it.

264
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,669
OK, Carla's in there facing
the greatest crisis of her life.

265
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,912
l want everybody to be quiet
for a moment,

266
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,279
close your eyes and send her
your most positive mental energy.

267
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,874
- Good idea.
- Guess it can't hurt.

268
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,793
Come on, everyone.
This is important.

269
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,157
One... two... three.

270
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,430
Norman!

271
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
Come on, Carla, don't be so cold.

272
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,959
l'm a lonely guy.

273
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,429
You're not lonely. You're disgusting.

274
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,637
Fine, just hear me out on this.

275
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,793
Anthony is the product of our love.

276
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,509
None of that, either.
l've had enough of your sweet talk.

277
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,956
- l don't wanna hear that stuff.
- All right.

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,228
Fine.

279
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,195
- No more sweet talk, no more touching.
- Right.

280
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,351
How about l just...

281
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,635
Stop it, Nick. Don't give me the look.

282
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,712
No, not the look!

283
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,950
Call me...

284
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,714
- ...irresponsible...
- The song!

285
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,919
- The look and the song!
- Call me unreliable...

286
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,315
l'll get the pen.

287
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,517
- Wait a minute, do that again.
- Can't get enough of it?

288
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,513
Nothing.

289
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,795
- Nothing?
- Zero!

290
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,072
You should have stopped
at your dumb look.

291
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,471
- What are you talking about?
- l'm talking about this!

292
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,596
l'm impressed.
l didn't think you had it in you.

293
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,718
This is the first time you stood up to me.

294
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,599
You resisted my charms.

295
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,515
You win.

296
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,469
Wait a minute, there.

297
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,154
l know better than that.

298
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,313
Your heart wasn't in it. You know
how much that kid meant to me.

299
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,392
What are you talking about?
l did my best.

300
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,994
Maybe l don't have it any more.

301
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,913
You have more of it now
than you ever did.

302
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,913
- You just went easy on me.
- l busted a gut!

303
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,037
Nick. You went easy on me, didn't you?

304
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,354
Maybe l did.

305
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,715
Maybe l didn't.

306
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,918
Well,

307
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,230
if you did,

308
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,799
thanks.

309
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,752
And if you didn't...

310
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,790
Take care.

311
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,993
Hey, everybody!

312
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,355
l got my kid back!

313
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,152
Come on, Loretta.

314
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,958
Congratulations, Carla.
What's your secret?

315
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,270
- She knows when to shut up.
- When?

316
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,873
Now.

317
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,271
l hope today has been
a good lesson for you.

318
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,318
l hope it has diffused the notion

319
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,235
that you have some magic power
to make women bend to your will.

320
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,113
Mr Tortelli, l find you beneath contempt.

321
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,912
Before you're so hard on me, l'd like
to tell you something about myself.

322
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,359
What?

323
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,915
lt's confidential.

324
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,195
What? l can't hear what you're saying.

325
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,590
All l can feel is your warm,

326
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,716
that is to say, your hot,

327
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,030
breath on my...

328
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,035
English ( en)
