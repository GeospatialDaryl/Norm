for this chance                 
to get to know Evan             

178
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,339
in a social setting.

        am I going to explain   
        Julie tagging along?

         I was tempted,         

578
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,559
    but what the hell?          

579
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:19,129
        We're both              
    consenting adults, huh?     

580
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:21,131
    I sure hope there's, uh,    
        some room               

581
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,167
 in that bunk of yours for me.  

582
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:26,270
            There isn't.        

583
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:31,758
 I got to stay off boats, man.  

584
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,615
             Hello.             

585
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:39,683
          Hey, Carla.           

586
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,468
          Did you pick          
     your mother-in-law up?     

587
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:42,636
             Yeah.              

588
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,338
I tried to pawn her off         
on some Hare Krishnas,          

589
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:46,589
          but I think           
      she's the only thing      

590
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,525
        they won't take         
        at the airport.         

591
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,377
    So, how's it been going?    

592
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:52,329
                    Oh, fine.   

593
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:55,132
        Well, they tried to pull
        that old birthday gag   

594
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,134
            where they get a    
            free round of beers,

595
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:59,153
          but I caught on       
          after the fifth round.

596
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:03,006
Oh, Gomer, Gomer, Gomer.        

597
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:03,824
Geez!                           

598
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,475
                Well, lucky for 
                me, I remembered

599
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,345
            that Mr. Clavin and 
            Mr. Peterson already
            had their birthday. 

600
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:11,799
Those foam suckers              
were in on this?!               

601
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,667
That does it.                   
Where are they?                 

602
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:14,868
CARLA:                          
Hey, hey, hey.                  

603
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:16,203
     I want to talk to you.     

604
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:18,339
    Nobody stiffs this bar.     

605
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:19,706
        Oh...                   
                    Oh...       

606
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,008
CARLA:                          
You owe me                      

607
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,143
        for five rounds.        

608
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,012
Hey, come here.                 

609
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:27,080
        Ooh.                    

610
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:29,983
All right, Cliffie,             
we split up.                    

611
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,685
There's no way                  
she can catch both of us.       

612
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:34,020
          Norm-Norm, she's...   
          she's gonna come after
          me first, Normie.     

613
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,322
Yeah. Ready?                    
                        No,     

614
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,156
             no, no, no, no, no.

615
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,241
          No, no, no.           

616
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:38,508
                    CARLA:      
                    No. Get back
                    here. Get...

617
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:39,843
            Oh, oh.             
                    Ooh, ooh.   

618
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,112
              Hey!              

619
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:43,447
    Where's the tip?
