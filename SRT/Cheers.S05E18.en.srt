1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,353
CARLA: Hey, Cheers is filmed

2
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:05,238
before a live studio audience.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,525
FRASIER: Hi, Wood.

4
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,026
Let me get a beer, will you?

5
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,529
Oh, say, what'd you
do to your thumb there?

6
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,531
Oh, well, it's a long story, but, uh,

7
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:17,534
I was playing this guy
some pool last night,

8
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:20,537
and I had this one-
four-seven combination.

9
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:21,538
Yeah.

10
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,006
So, I was trying to show off

11
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:24,507
and sink all of them in one shot,

12
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:25,508
but the balls were positioned

13
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,011
in such a way that I had to lean

14
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,879
way over the edge of the table

15
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,848
and get in a kind of twisted-up...

16
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:34,350
Yeah, so, what, you fell
and you broke your thumb?

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,852
No. I still couldn't get the shot,

18
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:37,721
so I went and got the bridge

19
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,139
and I got up on a chair

20
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,024
and I put all my weight on the bridge.

21
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:44,277
And it snapped and you
fell and broke your thumb?

22
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,228
No.

23
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:47,230
I made the shot and I beat the guy.

24
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,233
Oh, so he got angry and
he broke your thumb, right?

25
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,735
No, I beat him fair and square

26
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,236
and he paid me the ten bucks he owed me.

27
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,739
So, how did you break your thumb?

28
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,741
I slipped on the ice on the way home.

29
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,246
Woody, why did you go into

30
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:06,750
all that long-winded
detail about the game?

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,752
Well, now, it wouldn't
have been much of a story

32
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,136
without the pool stuff.

33
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,722
Hello, Woody.

34
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:14,724
What happened to your thumb?

35
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:16,226
Oh, I slipped on the ice.

36
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,817
Woody, why didn't you tell him
the long, drawn-out version?

37
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,069
That's the guy I was playing pool with.

38
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:33,777

What the hell is keeping Diane?

54
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,597
I'm gonna be late for school.

55
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,598
School, Carla?

56
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,600
Well, I must say I'm
delightfully astonished.

57
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,602
You know, I've always
held that adult education

58
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,105
is one of the finest gifts
that one can give oneself.

59
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,107
Kudos on joining the
ever-burgeoning ranks

60
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,608
of enlightened, wondering minds

61
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,110
seeking betterment through knowledge.

62
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,612
It's traffic school, you nimrod.

63
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:02,782
You got pinched, huh, Carla?

64
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,284
Yeah, speeding.

65
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,285
But it wasn't my fault.

66
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,787
There was a leaf stuck on my windshield,

67
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,790
and I had to gun her
up to 80 to blow it off.

68
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,177
What, and the cop didn't believe you?

69
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:15,929
No. Couldn't be bribed, either.

70
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,432
Carla, what, you offered
a policeman money?

71
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,935
Money? With a body like this? Huh.

72
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,939
Hello, everyone.

73
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,440
We're back.

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,942
Sammy, where you been, man?

75
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,860
Picking china patterns.

76
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:37,483
This may have been the
stupidest morning of my life.

77
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,985
Oh, Sam, don't forget.

78
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,487
Tomorrow we register for flatware.

79
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,489
The second stupidest.

80
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,874
Well, did you select something nice?

81
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,877
We've committed to
Royal Doulton's Carlisle

82
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,629
for the fine china,

83
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,965
but Sam still hasn't made up his mind

84
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,967
about the everyday ware.

85
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,468
Yes, I have.

86
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,471
I, I like the dishes with
the different colored flowers.

87
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,973
Oh, ish!

88
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,474
Come on, I love those.

89
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,977
They're just like I
had when I was a kid.

90
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,428
They're real pretty,

91
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,931
and-and if you don't like
the food on your plate,

92
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,432
you can hide it in the pattern.

93
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,436
Okay, fine.

94
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,939
Well, uh, why don't you think about it,

95
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:16,940
and if you still insist

96
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,444
that they're not the
most garish, bourgeois,

97
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,946
stomach-turningly ugly
pattern in the book,

98
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:23,947
then that's what we'll get.

99
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,034
She's making me nuts

100
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,285
with this wedding stuff.

101
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:30,586
So, ditch her.

102
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,589
You know, if I had my way,

103
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,591
I would find the nearest
justice of the peace

104
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,093
and, and tie the knot.

105
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,962
You know, that's not such a bad idea.

106
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,296
Right. Or you could ditch her.

107
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,683
Don't you have traffic
school, or something?

108
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,468
Nuts! Now I'm gonna be late!

109
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:49,472
Well, I guess I can make
it if I run all the yellows.

110
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,476
Sam... Yo.

111
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,479
I've got Penelope from the
bridal registry on the line,

112
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,480
and we're going back

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,982
over the linen choices.

114
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,484
Now, for the fingertip towels

115
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,987
in the guest bath, do
we want monogrammed,

116
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,488
or is that too ootsie?

117
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,874
The second thing you said.

118
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,878
I agree.

119
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:16,382
Of course... a simple
initial can be elegant.

120
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,384
Oh, I think you'd better
look at the picture.

121
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,886
I need a man's opinion.

122
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,889
Frasier, help Diane, will you please?

123
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,894
Sam, these will be our fingertip towels

124
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,896
for the rest of our lives.

125
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,939
We'd better get married
quick, or I'm gonna kill her.

126
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,444
All right, all right, that's it.

127
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,329
Bachelor party here tonight.

128
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,747
What are you talking about?

129
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,748
Well, didn't you hear the man?

130
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,249
Uh, they might be eloping.

131
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,118
And I'm not gonna be, uh, done out

132
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,919
of my right as best man

133
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,421
to, uh, throw him the best
wingding of the century.

134
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,924
All right now, so
what're we gonna have...?

135
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,425
Just a second here, Cliff.

136
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,295
Uh, Sam asked you to be his best man?

137
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,179
Well, not in so many words,

138
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,680
but, uh, you know, who's closest?

139
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,099
So, uh... (everybody talking)

140
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,017
Hold on now, I don't know.

141
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:10,520
I may not have known Sam
as long as some of you guys,

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,522
but we're pretty darned close.

143
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,024
I think I'm kind of like
the brother he never had.

144
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,026
Wait, Woody, Sam has a brother.

145
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:20,530
Guess we're not as close as I thought.

146
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,532
Well, look, I think we better throw

147
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,033
the greatest bachelor party

148
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,402
for the greatest
bachelor who ever lived.

149
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,870
Tell you what.

150
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,872
I'll pick up some deli
platters and some champagne,

151
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:30,873
and you guys can just reimburse me,

152
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,375
you know, at your leisure, all right?

153
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,377
CLIFF: Why didn't you
say so in the first place?

154
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,379
Okay, we got the food and
the drink taken care of.

155
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:37,880
Now we need a little
bit of entertainment.

156
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,382
Who's gonna...?

157
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,384
Well, I-I think
tradition calls for, uh,

158
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,385
what about a stag film, huh?

159
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:44,253
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think there's

160
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,506
a place on my route
that might sell them.

161
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,008
Uh, the, uh, Hot and
Nasty Video Boutique.

162
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,012
Yeah, I think there might be
one or two laying around there.

163
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,515
Okay, we got the food,
drink, entertainment.

164
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,516
Now all we need is a, uh,

165
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,434
a girl jumping out of the cake.

166
00:06:58,434 --> 00:06:59,435
(general agreement)

167
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh, yeah, I've seen them do that

168
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,822
in the movies all the time.

169
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,191
That seems like a waste
of good cake to me.

170
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,744
You see, Woody, the cake

171
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:09,529
is really immaterial.

172
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,030
It's the girl who's the actual dessert.

173
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,532
Right.

174
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,534
Well, then I think it
should be Miss Chambers.

175
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,785
FRASIER: Ooh. Aw, come on.

177
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,126
you know,

178
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:25,628
no guy wants his fiancée
jumping out of a cake.

179
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:29,132
It's, I mean, it's like
taking your mother to the prom.

180
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,134
(chuckling)

181
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,136
Or so I'm told.

182
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:39,642
PAUL: Okay, okay, okay,

183
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:42,145
so where can we get Sammy someone hot?

184
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,147
Dare we look in his book?

185
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,649
Nah, Sammy's had all those girls.

186
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,152
Oh, Sam, stop being
such a grumble-bunny.

187
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,654
Just grit your teeth and
pick out a dust ruffle.

188
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:55,658
Guys, I still say

189
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:57,660
we're missing a bet
right under our noses.

190
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,162
Look, pal, trust me...

191
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,663
Oh, it's... that's okay.

192
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,665
Listen, I... it wouldn't hurt to ask.

193
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,167
CLIFF: No, no, no, no, don't, don't...

194
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,668
Excuse me, Miss Chambers?

195
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:07,170
Yes, Woody? Uh...

196
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,173
Uh, would you like to jump out
of Sam's bachelor party cake?

197
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:17,647
Woody, I abhor such
juvenile, sexist male rituals.

198
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,849
Yeah, but would you do it?

199
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,018
Just checking.

200
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,486
All right, guys, you're right.

201
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:24,987
We're going to have to find

202
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:27,356
some other beautiful
girl to be Sam's dessert.

203
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:30,109
Wait a minute.

204
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,113
(laughing)

205
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,615
I, I just realized

206
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,618
why you want me,
the bride-to-be,

207
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,120
to jump from the cake.

208
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,122
It's a wonderful irony.

209
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,373
(laughs)

210
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,541
Oh...

211
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,009
Of course I'll do it.

212
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,010
Of course.

213
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,011
Oh, great.

214
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,963
Imagine me, of all people,

215
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,466
missing the point of a joke.

216
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,467
(laughing)

217
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,469
Hey, don't worry about
it, Miss Chambers.

218
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,970
It even happens to me.

219
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,278
NORM: Sammy, uh, what
time you got there, man?

220
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,230
11:15.

221
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,233
11:15. How did it get so late so early?

222
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,735
I'd better be getting home to, uh, Vera.

223
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:14,237
(yawning): Oh, yeah.

224
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,623
(everybody talking and yawning)

225
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,578
Yeah, you know what they say:

226
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,081
"An early bird catches
the obsessive-compulsive."

227
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:26,582
(laughing)

228
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,968
'Night, Sam.

229
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,887
MAN: Oh, boy!

230
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,890
They sure took off in
a hurry, didn't they?

231
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,761
Yeah, but that doesn't seem
suspicious to you, does it?

232
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,517
No, I... I guess not.

233
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,068
Oh, hey, I have an idea.

234
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,270
You go in the back

235
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,989
and total these receipts,
and we'll get out of here.

236
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,907
Okay.

237
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,409
All right.

238
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,411
Say, Woody, when I come back out here,

239
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,414
there's not going to be a
surprise for me, is there?

240
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,915
A surprise party, maybe?

241
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:00,916
No.

242
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,169
You're not lying, are you?

243
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,955
Sam, you'd know if I was lying.

244
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,840
I'd... I'd tell you.

245
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,128
Right. I'll, uh, I'll be in my office.

246
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,379
WOODY: All right.

247
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,684
Come on in, guys.

248
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,186
He doesn't suspect a thing.

249
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,190
Come on down, fellas.

250
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,693
(half-whispers)

251
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,197
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

252
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:40,539
Okay? In the words of the
immortal bard, "Party!"

253
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,041
(silent cheering)

254
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:47,129
Uh, Sam, you can go home now.

255
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,999
EVERYONE: Surprise!

256
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,251
(whooping and cheering)

257
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,754
(laughter and applause)

258
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,640
Wow!

259
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,927
Sam, you should have seen
the look on your face!

260
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,519
(music playing on video)

261
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:14,523
SAM: Ooh!

262
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:16,025
FRASIER: Hey!

263
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,026
All right!

264
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,027
(guys whooping)

265
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,528
Boy! Thanks, guys.

266
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,529
Yeah, man.

267
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,032
That last scene gave me new
respect for rowing machines.

268
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,917
I hear you, bud. Ooh!

269
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,871
Hey, you guys, oh! Thank you.

270
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:29,872
This has been fantastic.

271
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,257
I have to admit

272
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,508
that I used to think
that bachelor parties

273
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:33,876
were kind of embarrassing.

274
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:34,627
Get the lights!

275
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,512
SAM: Oh, God, not again...

276
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,464
(guys cheering)

277
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,772
Girl in there, right?

278
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,274
Well...

279
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,142
Just your type.

280
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,231
So make the obligatory
speech and have at her!

281
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,649
GUYS: Yeah!

282
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,402
Oh, no, I can't do it.

283
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,903
I... you know... (scoffs)

284
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,405
No, I-I know you went
to a lot of trouble.

285
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,291
I'm sorry, but it
just wouldn't be right.

286
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,209
CLIFF: What? Come on,
Sammy. What is this?

287
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,079
Malone, King of the Road!

288
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,833
(everyone whooping)

289
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,217
Better make hay, buddy.

290
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,218
After this, it is one woman

291
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,720
for the rest of your life. Oh, boy.

292
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,089
EVERYONE: Yeah...

293
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,595
I-I never really thought
about it in those terms before.

294
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,482
One woman for the rest of my life.

295
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,233
(everyone chuckles) I
mean, don't get me wrong.

296
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,602
I mean, she's... she's a...
she's a great woman, but, uh...

297
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,821
there's only one of her...

298
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,825
...for the rest of my life.

299
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,277
But, you know, it'll go quickly.

300
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,162
Just go-go ahead, cut the cake.

301
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:45,614
Boy, it really makes you think.

302
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,117
You know, I've been a
bachelor a good long time.

303
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,003
I mean, a good lot of women.

304
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,873
Now there won't be any more women.

305
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,758
Just woman.

306
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,376
One woman.

307
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,345
Yeah, but what a woman!

308
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,263
I mean, you know what? I've got an idea.

309
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,264
Why don't we have some cake?

310
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,017
(everyone agreeing)

311
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,802
One perfume.

312
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,804
One set of earlobes.

313
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,190
Not, not even sensitive earlobes.

314
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:17,813
One pair of lips flapping in my ears...

315
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,732
day after day until I die.

316
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,734
Oh, my God!

317
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,202
Sammy, Sammy, that's great.

318
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,704
Look, we got a big,
wonderful cake here, you know,

319
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,207
with a... with a very
special surprise inside...

320
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,161
which just might spoil
if you don't shut up!

321
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:36,165
Uh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

322
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:37,166
What am I doing?

323
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,918
I mean, if I'm going to tie myself

324
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,753
to the old ball and
chain, I might as well get

325
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,255
one last night of freedom in here.

326
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,257
(everyone agreeing)
Okay, bring her out here.

327
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,141
Strap her on.

328
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,059
Come on.

329
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,060
EVERYONE: Yeah!

330
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,066
Strap this on!

331
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:09,415
Sam, you should see
the look on your face!

332
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,071
Hi, guys.

333
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:17,957
Hey, Carla, how was traffic school?

334
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,291
Eh, it was all right.

335
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,292
NORM: Yeah?

336
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,294
Well, don't all those
gory movies they show

337
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,796
kind of turn your stomach a bit?

338
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,297
Hey, Norm, you're forgetting...

339
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,299
I've seen Diane without makeup.

340
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,053
Hello, everyone.

341
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,555
Hi.

342
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,556
Hello, you.

343
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:35,057
Let me help you with that.

344
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:36,058
Well, all right.

345
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,059
Boy, you look fantastic, dear.

346
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,561
That is a great outfit on you.

347
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,062
Sam... Hmm?

348
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,564
You make a lousy sycophant.

349
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:44,567
Yes, but I make a great margarita.

350
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,569
May I speak to you in
your office, please?

351
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,821
Sure, anything you want. You bet cha.

352
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,105
SAM: Oh, come on, smile.

353
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,106
DIANE: For some reason,

354
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:53,609
I don't feel like smiling.

355
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,611
Did I ever tell you how cute you are

356
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,613
when you're mad?

357
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,115
Come on, listen, snap
out of this, will you?

358
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,618
I mean, I-I didn't say
all that stuff last night

359
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,620
to hurt your feelings.

360
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,507
My feelings aren't hurt.

361
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,460
I just feel bad for you.

362
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,881
Sentenced to a life with one perfume...

363
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,637
...one set of insensitive earlobes,

364
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:25,941
one set of lips flapping in your ear...

365
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,612
...till you die.

366
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,483
Come on! I was with a bunch of guys.

367
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,452
I mean, they forced me to make a speech.

368
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:38,954
How the hell did I know
my fiancée was hiding

369
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,823
in the cake, taking dictation?

370
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,709
Did you mean it, Sam?

371
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,576
No.

372
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,379
See, it's just this...

373
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,381
this whole marriage thing's

374
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,884
kind of snuck up on me, that's all.

375
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,886
I mean, I'm happy that
you're the only woman

376
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,890
I'll make love to again... ever.

377
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:02,678
(fingers snapping)

378
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,063
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

379
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,431
yeah, but-but, you see...

380
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,816
I mean, if I had known

381
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,185
that the last one was
going to be the last one,

382
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,688
I-I-I would've
prepared myself for it.

383
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,359
Sweetheart, it's kind of like popcorn.

384
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,861
Now, you-you can munch away

385
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,663
as long as you know there's a bowlful,

386
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,081
but, you know, if all of a sudden,

387
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,867
it's all gone, there's nothing
left but the salt and the duds,

388
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,369
well, you feel bad,
because if you'd known

389
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,873
the last kernel was the last
one, you would've savored it.

390
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,177
Am I making myself clear on this?

391
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:38,047
Oh, yes, yes...

392
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,548
Oh. I'm salt and duds.

393
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:46,055
Well, I-I-I
don't know. I...

394
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:49,058
I don't know what to say to
make this right, except...

395
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,810
I'm sorry.

396
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,533
Would 24 hours of wild, uninhibited,

397
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:03,038
hedonistic sexual carousing with
anything in a tube top suffice?

398
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,629
In-in a-addition
to saying I'm sorry?

399
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,635
Sam, you can apologize
till the cows come home,

400
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,506
but it won't alleviate the problem.

401
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,924
After much consideration,

402
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:24,810
I propose that you go on a flesh binge.

403
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,181
Sow your wild oats.

404
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,683
Get it out of your system.

405
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,187
Savor your last kernel of popcorn.

406
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,107
Are you serious?

407
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:39,608
Absolutely.

408
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,611
It's the only way we can
establish a clean slate.

409
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:46,615
No guilt, no remorse, no regrets.

410
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,000
So...

411
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,336
dive into that little black
book of yours and enjoy.

412
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,838
Oh, you know,

413
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,706
I threw that dumb thing
away when we got engaged.

414
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,627
I'm sure you have one
or two numbers etched

415
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,129
in your memory.

416
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:01,880
You listen to me.

417
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,051
I'm only going to agree to do
this because I love you, Diane.

418
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,224
Well, don't do it for me, Sam.

419
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,526
Do it for the health
of our future marriage.

420
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,528
Right, right, right.

421
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,030
Uh, excuse me, uh...

422
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,533
when do my, uh, 24 hours begin?

423
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,534
Right now.

424
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,036
All right. The same as mine.

425
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,039
Okay. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!

426
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,542
Yours?

427
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,494
Of course, Sam.

428
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,379
This is the only way we can be sure

429
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,383
that I have all other
men out of my system.

430
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,728
No... no...

431
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,109
Sammy back yet?

432
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,910
Uh, well, uh,

433
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,412
"T" minus 30 minutes and counting.

434
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,282
I figure right about now,

435
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:14,169
Sammy's probably leaning
back in bed and smoking.

436
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,171
Oh, wait, I don't, uh, remember

437
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,173
ever seeing Sammy smoke a cigarette.

438
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,592
Who said anything about cigarettes?

439
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,596
Ho, the man!

440
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,964
All right!

441
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,933
Hey, what's the score, Sammy?

442
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,936
Oh, Norm, you know he's not the
kind of guy to kiss and tell...

443
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,438
not that he wastes much time
kissing, anyway, eh, compadre?

444
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,442
Yeah, you guys know me, all right.

445
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,945
So, has anyone, uh...
anyone heard from Diane?

446
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,447
No, not a word. It's been heaven. Ah.

447
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,899
Why? You worried about her?

448
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:44,900
No, I'm not worried.

449
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,401
Wha-What makes you think I'm worried?

450
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,903
Uh, what time is it, anyway?

451
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,405
It's time for you to stop worrying.

452
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:51,907
I mean, for God's sakes, Sammy,

453
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,910
who'd be stupid enough to touch Diane?

454
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,411
Besides you.

455
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,412
Good point.

456
00:19:57,412 --> 00:20:00,415
You know, uh, yeah, what
am I worried about here?

457
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,885
Oh, Rick, you really came through.

458
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,837
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

459
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,839
Rick was kind enough to drive me to work

460
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,342
when my car broke down.

461
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,345
I knew that.

462
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,229
I, uh...

463
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:17,149
I just wanted to give
him a thank-you shake.

464
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,651
Thank you, thank you.

465
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,993
Uh, maybe I'll, uh, take
a rain check on that drink.

466
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,495
Uh, good luck with your marriage.

467
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,496
Yes. Thank you.

468
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:32,998
Thank you. Thank you very much.

469
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,499
Thank you, Rick.

470
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,002
Well...

471
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,004
I guess I'll just, uh...

472
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,006
begin my shift.

473
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,008
Uh, yeah, like hell you will!

474
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,010
Sam? Now, Sam! Sam!

475
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:48,880
All right.

476
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,633
Where were you last night, hmm?

477
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,522
I was taking full
advantage of my 24 hours.

478
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,476
I looked into the recesses of my heart,

479
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,979
and I realized that I still had...

480
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,982
one oat that needed to be sown.

481
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,486
One fantastic oat.

482
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:15,240
Is that all you
think about-- sex?

483
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,044
You know, it's disgusting!

484
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,047
Wh-Wh-Whatever happened
to romance, to commitment?

485
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,048
I mean, look at you!

486
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,917
Look at you-- you haven't
even changed your dress!

487
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:30,839
I am wearing this dress
again because I like it.

488
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,225
It sets off my eyes.

489
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,093
Yeah, I'll set off your eyes.

490
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,478
You know...

491
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:37,929
You want know something?

492
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,432
I had the exact same 24 hours you did,

493
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,433
and I didn't do anything.

494
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,434
You know why?

495
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,936
Because I happen to be a one-woman guy.

496
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,738
I mean, I mean,

497
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,273
I think we got something
special going here,

498
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,275
and I didn't want to cheapen
it, like somebody else

499
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,777
I could mention.

500
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,747
You-you know, people could
refer to you as a tart.

501
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,669
How can you say that?

502
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,120
Easy. Tart!

503
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,006
Tart, tart, tart, tart!

504
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,173
I mean, what-what else

505
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,875
do you call somebody who didn't go home?

506
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,760
How do you know that?

507
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,264
Because I was idiot enough
to spend the entire night

508
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,266
watching your apartment from my car,

509
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,134
and you did not go home.

510
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,806
Well, you must be exhausted.

511
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,307
Yeah, yeah, that's right! I'm exhausted.

512
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,809
You're damned right, I'm exhausted.

513
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,811
Oh, come on, Sam.

514
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,563
Now, you had a little
catnap around 6:00 a.m.

515
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:29,364
Did not.

516
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:32,367
How'd you know that?

517
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:34,870
Because I was down the street

518
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,239
in my car watching you watch me.

519
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,045
Oh, my God, you spied on me!

520
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,913
I mean, that stinks!

521
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:48,800
What... what hap...
what happened to faith?

522
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,304
What-what-what happened...
what happened to trust?

523
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,805
My God!

524
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,307
Sam!

525
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,810
I took a lover's leap of faith

526
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,813
in granting you sexual carte blanche

527
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:06,768
for the past 24 hours!

528
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:10,155
And just as my heart suspected,

529
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,907
instead of gallivanting about,

530
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,910
you spent the whole time spying on me.

531
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,913
(wry chuckle)

532
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:21,416
I had one last night to go
out and have a great time,

533
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,834
and I blow it.

534
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,921
God, I'm a poor excuse for a stud.

535
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,959
I don't know about that.

536
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,962
We still have five minutes left...

537
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,348
in our deal.

538
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,767
Five minutes?

539
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,768
Mm-hmm.

540
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:42,771
Well, hell, somebody
should've told me that.

541
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:47,275
Damn it!

542
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,365
How long did you say we have here?

543
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,366
Five minutes.

544
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,368
Not enough time. Now, come on, Sam.

545
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,869
We'd better skip to the good part.

546
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,371
No... come on.

547
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,874
We have to go to work! Sam! Whoo!
