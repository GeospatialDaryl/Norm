1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:04,018
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:05,670
Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,306
So, what's the latest?

4
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,158
Frasier passed out about 3:00.

5
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:11,543
Aw! Poor guy.

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,411
Yeah. For someone whose
wife is leaving him,

7
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:17,048
he seems awfully upset.

8
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:20,385
Oh, God! My head! Sam,

9
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,087
uh... coffee, please.

10
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:26,491
Oh, Carla, uh...
about last night...

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,427
I was in pretty bad shape,
you know?

12
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,828
I was drunk, and I was
carrying on about Lilith.

13
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,532
And I have this
half-memory of you

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,270
dragging me
into the office and cleaning me up,

15
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:39,837
putting me on the couch,

16
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,240
laying a blanket
over me and-and...

17
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,476
and sitting with me
until I fell asleep.

18
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,678
And, well, even
in my drunken stupor,

19
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,148
I wanted to thank you for
your... your unexpected kindness. Thanks.

20
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:51,983
Glad to help.

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,267
Here's your coffee.

22
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,403
Thank you, Sam.

23
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,171
Geez!
What time is it?

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,673
You know,

25
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,959
I could have sworn
I had my Rolex on.

26
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:05,080
FRASIER:
Hey, where's my class ring?

27
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:12,354

Boy, I've never felt
so low in my life.

35
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:59,767
Well, Doc, if it means anything
to ya, I'm here for ya.

36
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:03,021
It doesn't, Cliff, but thanks.

37
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:07,192
Boy, Dr. Sternin-Crane having
an affair with another guy.

38
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,427
Mm, this reminds me

39
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,963
of a terrible scandal
we had back in Hanover.

40
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,466
Rocked the whole
town to its core.

41
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,236
Mayor's wife ran off
with old Mr. Smithers.

42
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,588
Oh, that's not
so scandalous, Woody.

43
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,841
Well, Mr. Smithers was a goat.

44
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,645
W-Woody, why... why
don't you take a break?

45
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,148
Again?

46
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,917
Man, this day is flying!

47
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:35,270
You know what the most
painful thing about it is?

48
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,637
I... I didn't
see it coming.

49
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:38,073
Lilith had an affair.

50
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,641
I had no idea.

51
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,710
Now she's leaving me and...

52
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,411
There were no signs.

53
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,859
Do you know what I mean, Sam?

54
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,664
Sam?

55
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:47,866
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,901
I'm still back
on Mr. Smithers.

57
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:53,454
Now, Doc, maybe
there were signs,

58
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:55,256
you were just
too blind to see them.

59
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:57,391
Yeah, I mean, what
with Lilith, uh...

60
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,528
spending every night late at
work for the last six months.

61
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,196
You know, whenever the
two of you were together,

62
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:03,431
you were just
bickering all the time.

63
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:04,833
And, worst of all, you know,

64
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,901
you spend all
your waking hours sitting in this bar.

65
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:07,652
Cliffy, I don't think
he wants to...

66
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:10,522
No, Sam, you know,
I want to hear this.

67
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,722
Maybe it's time somebody

68
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,259
did splash the cold water
of reality in my face.

69
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,495
On the other hand, at least
I'm not a career-stagnant,

70
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:20,633
middle-aged mama's boy with
little or no sexual experience.

71
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,234
I know what you mean, Doc.

72
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:26,871
We have a few of those
at work- very sad.

73
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,227
I can't believe
she wants to leave me.

74
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:34,395
I really blew it.

75
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:37,265
Well, Fras, you know,
marriage is a very tricky thing.

76
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,935
It takes a lot of work
and sacrifice and compromise

77
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,237
from both parties
to keep it fresh and rewarding.

78
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,173
How can you say that?

79
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:48,009
You work less at your marriage
than anyone else in the world!

80
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,694
I was hoping
the irony would cheer you up.

81
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,333
Well, Doc, if you ask me,

82
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,569
you're wasting your time
sitting around here

83
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,036
feeling sorry for yourself,

84
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,038
when you should be out there
trying to get her back.

85
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,140
How do you suggest I do that?

86
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,309
Get off your butt
and take charge.

87
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:06,010
Be a caveman.

88
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,278
A woman likes that.

89
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,613
Caveman?

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,116
Trust me-
Nick Tortelli...

91
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,318
now there was a caveman.

92
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,153
In fact, the next time you see

93
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,623
one of those drawings of how
man evolved from the ape,

94
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,626
look real closely
at that second guy.

95
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,131
Thanks for the idea, Carla,

96
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,065
but I hardly think
the primitive approach

97
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:31,436
would work on a woman
as sophisticated as Lilith.

98
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,421
Well, then why don't you
try the romantic route?

99
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:36,057
You know, take her up to the
Cape for a romantic weekend

100
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,692
and treat her the
way you used to.

101
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,278
Oh, no, no, no-
Come on, Sam, with that bush-wa.

102
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,780
You know, if you want
to keep a woman in your life,

103
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,750
nothing beats the old-fashioned
fake heart attack.

104
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,454
I beg your pardon?

105
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:53,391
She goes for the door,
you go for your chest.

106
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,692
I mean, nobody can walk out

107
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,227
on somebody who's
having a coronary.

108
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,163
It's foolproof.
I learned it from Ma.

109
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,065
She uses that on you?

110
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,617
Or I use it on her.

111
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,375
It depends who's
trying to leave.

112
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,058
Frasier...

113
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,130
Well, look who's here.

114
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:18,199
I suppose this is the
part where we fight

115
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,568
over who gets to
keep our friends.

116
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,971
No...

117
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,557
Then why are you here?

118
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,226
To humiliate me
again in public?

119
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,727
Seems to be a theme you enjoy.

120
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:31,512
No, I was worried about you.

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,349
I brought you a shaving kit
and some clean clothes.

122
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,619
You were worried about me?

123
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,920
Then you're not leaving me?

124
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,238
Oh, I'm still leaving you.

125
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,173
Frasier, this is so...

126
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,425
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,680
I think we should have
this discussion in the office.

128
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,649
WOODY:
Oh, no chance of that, Dr. Sternin-Crane.

129
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,868
Sam's office
is his inner sanctum.

130
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:56,204
The only person who gets
to use Sam's office is Sam.

131
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,075
It's all right, Woody.
It's all right.

132
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,191
Oh, well, maybe if Kelly
ever has an affair,

133
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,893
I'll get to use
your precious office.

134
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,596
Poor Fras, huh?

135
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,398
What about Lilith?
Huh?

136
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:09,867
She's probably just
trying to find herself.

137
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,419
Oh, come off it, Becs.

138
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,721
Nobody tries to find
themselves anymore.

139
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,139
And, even when it was in style,

140
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,059
it was just an excuse
for middle-aged people to quit work,

141
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,262
ride around on Harleys,
and have sex with young people.

142
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,913
Oh, is that right,
Miss Know-It-All?

143
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:24,349
Well, it just so happens

144
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,118
that my father once
left for six months to find himself.

145
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,152
And when he came back,

146
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,287
he was at peace with the world.

147
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,388
You could see it in his eyes

148
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,090
the second he came
roaring up the driveway.

149
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:35,259
Well, here we are.

150
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,195
Is this it?

151
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:41,699
Should I, uh... call a lawyer,
initiate divorce proceedings?

152
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,601
It's up to you.

153
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:45,937
You're the one making all
the decisions, apparently.

154
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,005
Frasier,
I do not want a divorce.

155
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,641
I want a trial separation.

156
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,042
Furthermore,
I'm going to be gone

157
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,511
for a while, so I need to know

158
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:55,012
that Frederick
is being taken care of

159
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,614
in the best manner possible.

160
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,816
It would be irresponsible
for me to take him

161
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,734
from a comfortable
and familiar home

162
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:02,503
where he feels stable
and secure.

163
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,922
Therefore, I would like you

164
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,558
to have sole custody for the
period of time that I'm gone.

165
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,793
Just like that?

166
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:09,761
You're not only
walking out on me,

167
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,129
but on your own son as well.

168
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:14,132
Oh, Frasier, you think this
is easy for me? It's not!

169
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,101
Please just promise me
you'll take care of my son!

170
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,636
Wouldn't have it any other way.

171
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,856
Personally, I don't
want him growing up

172
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,792
in your swinging
bachelorette pad,

173
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,662
what with your
love beads, your hi-fi

174
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,233
and your Dave Brubeck albums!

175
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,852
Frasier, if you can't
get into the '90s,

176
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,253
at least move into the '60s.

177
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,022
Well, then where are
you going to live?

178
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,991
All right, let me guess.
Don't tell me!

179
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:43,027
You're going to move in with
your boyfriend, Dr. Pascal!

180
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,563
That's right, Frasier, I am.

181
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,349
What's so great about this
Pascal guy anyway, huh?

182
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,051
I mean, the man
is obviously a crackpot.

183
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,755
All he's noted for is inventing
this ridiculous bubble underground.

184
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,056
It's called
an Eco-pod, Frasier.

185
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,808
A self-contained

186
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,460
subterranean environment
which will serve

187
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:02,680
as a prototype
for an eventual space station.

188
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:05,933
Similar to the Biosphere, only
on a much more ambitious scale.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,154
To be inhabited by moles
and gophers, no doubt.

190
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:13,040
Yes, it will house a variety
of animal species.

191
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:16,043
And, for the first year,
two human subjects as well.

192
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:17,478
Oh, really?
And where in the world

193
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,814
do you expect to find...
Oh, no!

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,869
Yes, Frasier, I'm off
to live in the Eco-pod.

195
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,639
Oh, no!

196
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:30,474
It's a noble experiment.

197
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,810
I'm a pioneer.

198
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,948
The research we are going to do
is going to aid all of humanity.

199
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:39,166
This is the stupidest day
I've ever had.

200
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,519
It's anything but
stupid, Frasier.

201
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,921
Dr. Pascal is a visionary.

202
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,990
I'm proud to be associated
with him as we chart the future.

203
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,660
Oh, this will be a big hit on
the cocktail party circuit.

204
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,596
"Say, Fras, where's your
lovely wife this evening?"

205
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,097
"Well, Bob,

206
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,601
she's underneath the Earth's
crust with her boyfriend."

207
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,339
"What's new with you?"

208
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,307
I refuse to discuss
this any further.

209
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,175
You're being irrational.

210
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,177
No, wait, Lilith, wait.
Don't go, please.

211
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,547
Look, I... I'm sorry.

212
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,800
Please help me to understand
why you're doing this.

213
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,326
Well, Frasier...

214
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:25,329
ever since I was a little girl,

215
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:29,667
I've led a very disciplined,
regimented life.

216
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,519
But in the
back of my mind, I always had this

217
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,206
nagging feeling
that something was missing.

218
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,508
I tried to fill the void
with achievements...

219
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,778
scientific awards,
marriage to a prominent man.

220
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,965
But deep down inside,
I still felt empty.

221
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:48,836
Then along came Googie.

222
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,754
Googie?

223
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,907
Dr. Pascal.

224
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,176
He's a free thinker.
A radical.

225
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,412
I never know
what he's going to do next.

226
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,814
And when I'm with him,

227
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,732
I don't know
what I'm going to do next.

228
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,101
That's new for me, Frasier.

229
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:08,106
I like it.

230
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,358
I hope you understand.

231
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:13,577
(sighing):
I suppose I do.

232
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,982
You know, maybe
I haven't always listened.

233
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,953
Maybe I haven't always known
the right thing to say or do.

234
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,422
Just one thing
I want you to know.

235
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,293
I wish you the very best.

236
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:32,096
I adore you, and I always will.

237
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,133
Thank you.

238
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,507
Take good care of Frederick.

239
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,376
And yourself.

240
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,047
Good-bye, Frasier.

241
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,017
Good-bye, my love.

242
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,319
(gasping)
Oh! Oh, my God!

243
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,526
I'm having a heart attack!

244
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,281
Well, maybe not.

245
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,573
I'm going now.

246
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,309
I'd like to leave
a parting word.

247
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,611
I want you to know that what
I'm doing is very difficult.

248
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,714
It is not to hurt Frasier.

249
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,550
It's to acknowledge the
fact that I'm changing.

250
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:30,287
No one can go living year in and
year out without ever changing.

251
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,956
It's impossible.

252
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,328
Or at least it's very rare.

253
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,999
Well, I'm off.

254
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,934
I don't know what
the future holds.

255
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,703
Whatever happens, I only hope

256
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,971
I can realize my
full potential.

257
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,508
To acquire things the
old Lilith never had.

258
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,693
Like a body temperature?

259
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,031
That's very good, Carla.

260
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:59,367
Incidentally,

261
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,451
I've taken your
little wisecracks

262
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,021
for a few years now,
you hideous gargoyle,

263
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:06,790
and if you ever open
that gateway to hell you call a mouth

264
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,259
in my direction again,

265
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,794
I'll snap off
your extremities like dead branches

266
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,030
and feed them
to you at gunpoint.

267
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:17,701
God! That felt good.

268
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,405
Well...

269
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,575
that was just plain rude.

270
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:35,986
Oh, hey, Fras.

271
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,354
How you doing, huh?

272
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,541
Come on, talk to us-
we're your friends.

273
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,930
Say something
to him, will ya? Like what?

274
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,230
I don't know,
somethin' positive.

275
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,766
Something to cheer him up.

276
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,603
Frasier, say, have
you lost weight?

277
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,825
What? That would
cheer me up.

278
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:04,047
I appreciate your concern,
everyone, and...

279
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,016
you can stop worrying.

280
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,602
You see, I know exactly
how this is gonna go.

281
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,472
After the shock wears off,
there will be some initial pain

282
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,474
followed by resentment
and depression,

283
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,794
and a lasting
sense of insecurity,

284
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,080
as I ping-pong blame
between Lilith and myself.

285
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,634
Throughout this process,
all I have to do is...

286
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:28,639
keep telling myself that
everything is going to be okay.

287
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,476
Well, the shock
seems to be wearing off.

288
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,611
Here comes the pain.

289
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,333
Oh, boy.

290
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,836
Oh, mama, that's a big one!

291
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:46,123
Frasier, can we
do anything for ya?

292
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,058
Oh, no, Sam, no.

293
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,860
If anyone
has the inner resources

294
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,296
to deal with this,
it's Dr. Frasier Crane.

295
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,730
Trust me.

296
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:56,333
I know exactly
how to handle this.

297
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,139
I'm gonna jump, Lilith!

298
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,784
OFFICER (over bullhorn):
Attention, this is the police.

299
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,504
Do not jump.
I repeat, do not jump.

300
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:20,073
Whatever your problem is,
we can solve it.

301
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,742
Just go back inside.

302
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,545
I swear to God I'm gonna jump!

303
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:27,898
Where's that shrink we use
in cases like this?

304
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,966
You mean Frasier Crane?

305
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,284
He's not answering his pager.

306
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,902
Yeah, remind me
to put this in my report.

307
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,537
That man'll never work
in this town again.

308
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,256
Hey, you have
your whole life ahead of ya.

309
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,843
Anything good on?

310
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:43,480
Yeah, we got, uh, Oprah,
we got, uh... Quincy...

311
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,817
Home Shopping Network...

312
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,186
we got a guy on a ledge...

313
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:51,121
we got Barnaby Jones...

314
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,473
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Normie!

315
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,614
Normie, go back, quick.

316
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,512
Go back, go back,
go back- yeah, yeah.

317
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:57,277
Oh, my God!

318
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:00,314
Hey, that's that Quincy where
they buried the wrong guy!

319
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:04,151
SAM: Hey, Normie, go back
to that guy-on-the-ledge stuff.

320
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,486
Hey, that's just right outside.

321
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,488
No wonder all these people
are in here.

322
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,657
I wonder who the poor sap is.

323
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,857
OFFICER:
Go back inside.

324
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:14,461
FRASIER:
I swear to God I'm gonna jump!

325
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,979
Oh, my God!
Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,314
Sam, uh, you find Lilith,

327
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,583
and Carla and I'll go
up and find Frasier.

328
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,552
Come on, come on, Norm,
I'm going up there, too.

329
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,586
Normie, come on, will ya?

330
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,155
A buddy of ours
is on the ledge.

331
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,090
He's about to jump
to his death- let's go!

332
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,261
Geez, you're right-
I better go move my car.

333
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:35,365
Aw...

334
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,852
Frasier?

335
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,654
Hey, uh, I'll take it.

336
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,156
I'm a friend of his-
I think I can help.

337
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:45,492
I've operated these before, sir.
It's all right.

338
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:49,496
Frasier, it's me-
your friend, Cliff Clavin.

339
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:51,765
Now pitching for Boston...

340
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,066
Hey, come on, would ya?

341
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,935
All right. Just kidding,
just kidding.

342
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:57,004
Uh, Fras...

343
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,174
look, buddy, uh, don't think
I don't know how you feel.

344
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:03,277
Uh, it's not like
I haven't been there myself,

345
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,462
you know, standing
high above the city

346
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,164
with the wind
blowing through your hair,

347
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,900
praying this time
you'll have the guts to do it.

348
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,201
Give me that!

349
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,921
Frasier, Frasier,
don't listen to him, man.

350
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:16,156
So it didn't work out
with Lilith.

351
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,592
You know? What's the big deal?
That's okay.

352
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,027
What about your friends?

353
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:22,263
What about me?
I care for ya.

354
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,764
Hell, I love ya, man!

355
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,332
CROWD:
Aw...

356
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,601
Yeah, I said it.

357
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,638
Look, a guy can love another guy

358
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:33,407
without being the kind of guy
who loves other guys.

359
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,460
You knew what I was saying,
didn't you, Fras?

360
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,795
You didn't think that I meant...

361
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,630
the other thing, did ya?

362
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:43,597
Hold on a second, Fras.

363
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:45,386
Take that. Talk to him.

364
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,787
No, it's all right.

365
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,256
I'm his wife.
Don't aggravate him.

366
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:50,637
I'm the reason he's up there.

367
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:53,093
He's very unstable.

368
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:58,348
Frasier, you're making
a big fool of yourself.

369
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,734
Don't leave me, Lilith!

370
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,237
It's too late, Frasier-
I've made up my mind.

371
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:05,588
I'm gonna jump!

372
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,209
Lie to him- tell him
you'll go back with him.

373
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:11,312
Tell him to go inside.

374
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:14,548
I can't lie to you, Frasier.
It's over.

375
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,751
(crowd murmurs) Come on, lady!

376
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:21,021
What were we supposed to do,
go on living the charade?

377
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,090
Sure, we had
an amazing sex life,

378
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:25,342
but a relationship
is more than that.

379
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,660
I felt the confines
of our marriage

380
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,662
were not allowing me to grow.

381
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:35,068
Surely some of you women
know what I'm talking about.

382
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:37,804
VARIOUS WOMEN:
Right on! Right on! Yay!

383
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:42,142
Why don't you tell them
about your affair?!

384
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,712
(crowd groans)

385
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:48,682
Well, I was in
a very vulnerable state, and...

386
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,317
Frasier, this is ridiculous.

387
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,319
I'm coming upstairs.

388
00:17:56,691 --> 00:18:00,010
Fras, a-about
what I was saying earlier.

389
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:04,014
You know, there are all kinds
of different kinds of love.

390
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,517
(gasps):
Frasier!

391
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:10,153
You stay back!
Okay, okay.

392
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:11,805
Rebecca, I found him!

393
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,307
Frasier...

394
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:14,624
Don't come near me!

395
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,227
I-I won't come
near you, Frasier.

396
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,295
Please, please,
just step inside.

397
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,982
Oh, Rebecca, go back to Cheers
and leave me alone.

398
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,433
No, Frasier, we're
your friends.

399
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:26,204
Don't jump- you have lots of
friends who care about you.

400
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,073
NORM (over bullhorn): Frasier,
listen to me- this is Norm Peterson.

401
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,108
I want you to listen
very carefully.

402
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,278
You left about a half a mug
of beer on the bar.

403
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,496
You don't suppose
that I could, maybe...

404
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:37,730
Help yourself!

405
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:39,199
Thank you.

406
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,034
Frasier...

407
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,886
Lilith, don't come near me-
I swear I'll jump!

408
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,054
Would you excuse us, please?

409
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,789
I'd like to speak
with my husband.

410
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:48,558
Okay... But before I go,
I want to say one thing.

411
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:51,095
Go ahead and jump, you coward!

412
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:52,246
Take the easy way out!

413
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,913
Go ahead and end it all!

414
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:57,067
(whispers):
Wow, that was reverse psychology, right?

415
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:00,203
What's reverse psychology?

416
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,674
Frasier...

417
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:07,344
I refuse to indulge
in this little game

418
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,546
of emotional blackmail
any longer.

419
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,565
You and I both know you have
no intention of jumping.

420
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,334
I know you better than that.

421
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,969
No, you don't, Lilith.

422
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:18,972
I'm gonna jump,
because I can't go on living

423
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,141
knowing that
you love someone else.

424
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,148
Very well, Frasier.

425
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,483
You win.

426
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,303
I won't leave you.

427
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,038
Really?

428
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:36,190
Really.

429
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,192
Now, come inside.

430
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,899
You mean, you're not
just saying that?

431
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,734
No, I'm not just saying it.

432
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,136
I won't leave you.

433
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:52,405
I may be unhappy for
the rest of my days, but...

434
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:55,042
I will honour my obligations
as your wife.

435
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,826
Baby, you're the greatest!

436
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,283
(sighs)

437
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:04,951
Oh, go on, Lilith...

438
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,620
get out of here.

439
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,955
What do you mean?

440
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:11,675
I can't be happy
knowing that you're not.

441
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,360
(window sliding closed)

442
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,196
(sighs)

443
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:18,549
Thank you, Frasier.

444
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,701
Well, thank you for...

445
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,736
getting me off the ledge.

446
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,921
I was gonna pretend to faint

447
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,674
and fall back in,
but this worked a lot better.

448
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,807
How you doing?

449
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,943
Oh, I'll be
okay, Sam. Thanks.

450
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:50,296
You want anything,
you let me know.

451
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:52,799
Well, you know,
there is, uh, one thing.

452
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:56,936
Could you, uh, take the bullhorn
away from Cliff and Norm?

453
00:20:56,937 --> 00:21:00,090
CLIFF (on bullhorn): All right, McGerk,
you'll never take me alive! Ha-ha!

454
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,225
Come on, come on,
it's my turn! Come on!

455
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:05,228
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!

456
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,398
Whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, whoa.

457
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,551
Hey, come on!

458
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,839
Frasier, I just wanted
to say good-bye.

459
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,257
Dr. Pascal and I

460
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,709
are leaving
for the desert tonight.

461
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,578
Are you all right?

462
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:23,880
No... but I will be.

463
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:27,233
I said good-bye to Frederick
this afternoon.

464
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,936
He loves the thought of Mommy

465
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,154
going off to live
in a big bubble.

466
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,840
I'm sure this will be
a special memory for him

467
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,376
that he will relive
over and over again

468
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:39,446
in the years
of his psychoanalysis.

469
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,031
(door opens)

470
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,315
Lilith, you ready?

471
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:45,151
Googie, I thought
you were going to wait outside.

472
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:48,355
Before we leave there's
something I have to say to your husband.

473
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:50,356
Uh...

474
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:53,009
I-I-I know this is
an awkward moment, Doctor,

475
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,545
but I have to tell you.

476
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,280
I was pulling up
in front of the bar just now,

477
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:01,084
and I seem to have
dinged your BMW.

478
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:05,405
Oh. Of course you did.

479
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:08,291
Well, we're off.

480
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,693
We've got to be going.

481
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:12,362
Good-bye, Frasier.

482
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,830
Good-bye, Lilith.

483
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,832
Oh, there's just...

484
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:18,084
there's something
I'd like to say.

485
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,120
I know you've got a
rough year ahead of you.

486
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,721
You're in for some rocky times.

487
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:25,024
I-I'm sure you'll experience
some very painful moments,

488
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:27,344
and when you do,

489
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:30,564
I'd like you to feel free
to call on me for...

490
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:32,699
sympathy and understanding.

491
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,701
Thank you, Frasier.

492
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:37,003
I was talking to Googie.
