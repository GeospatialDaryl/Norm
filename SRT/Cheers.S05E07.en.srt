00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,255
SAM: Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,090
Why don't you wait? I'll get our coats.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,591
Mm. Okay?

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,594
Hope to see you again soon.

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,595
Thank you, Miss.

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,597
Oh, great.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,100
I can't even read that check.

8
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,604
Well, I'm so sorry if my handwriting

9
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,107
isn't up to your high
and mighty standards,

10
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,608
but some of us don't get to sit around

11
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,611
on our buns all day and
practice our penmanship.

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,479
Some of us

13
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:30,864
have to go out and earn a living!

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,232
Here are your glasses, dear.

15
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,616
You left them in your coat again.

16
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,617
Oh, thanks.

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,487
What's wrong?

18
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:38,988
Nothing.

19
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,491
Let's go.

20
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,994
Oh, hey, um... I'm really sorry.

21
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:45,995
I-I...

22
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:50,383
I don't know what to say,
except I had a really bad day.

23
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:56,556
Oh... yeah, sure, Carla, bad day.

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,391
Bad life is more like it.

25
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,311
House full of kids, this crummy job.

26
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,313
If I keep treatin'
my customers this way,

27
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,065
I'm going to lose even that.

28
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,901
Uh, uh, here you go.

29
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,402
I hope things'll start looking up.

30
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,404
Oh, no, no, no, no, I
couldn't, I couldn't.

31
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,405
Not the way I treated you.

32
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,908
No, please, please, please, we insist.

33
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,910
(sighs)

34
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,416
Ten bucks?

35
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,503
Excuse me, Miss.

36
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,505
You forgot to, uh, give me a napkin.

37
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,511
I'm so sorry!

38
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,513
I don't know what to say,

39
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,016
except I've had a really bad day.

40
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,521
Bad day? Bad life is more like it.

41
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,522
A house full of kids...

42
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,893

Today marks the beginning
of my seventh year

59
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,801
as a U.S. postal carrier.

60
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,302
Well, all right.

61
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:08,304
Woody, I think that calls for
a little drink on the house.

62
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:09,305
What do you think, huh?

63
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,557
I think you're right, Mr. Peterson.

64
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,392
Yeah? Hey, what the hell,
give Cliffie one, too.

65
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,393
Hey...

66
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,894
This guy, huh?

67
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,897
Oh, yeah, imagine that.

68
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,899
Seven years carrying the old bag around.

69
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:20,900
(snorts)

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,902
Yeah, I know the feeling.

71
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,821
That's, uh...

72
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,706
that's quite an
achievement, though, Cliffie.

73
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
Oh, yeah? Look who's talkin'.

74
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,210
Oh, okay, all right.

75
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
I know some people around
here don't exactly think

76
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,715
that I'm an overachiever,
but, uh... I'll tell you,

77
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,217
I don't plan to go to my grave

78
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,719
until I've made some sort
of impression on this world.

79
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,972
I'd say you've already made a deep one.

80
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,257
You know,

81
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,259
I plan on leavin' somethin' behind

82
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,261
for the world to remember me by.

83
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,762
Yeah?

84
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,264
And here it is.

85
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,765
(sighs)

86
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,768
It's a glass of Windex, Woody.

87
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,771
No, it's a drink.

88
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,658
And Woody Boyd is going to
become the next Jim Sheehan.

89
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,942
Who?

90
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,444
Certainly you've heard of the inventor

91
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,828
of the Fish House Punch?

92
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,829
I can't say we have,

93
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,830
Wood, but then again,

94
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,199
we don't get out that much, you know?

95
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,619
Well, I'm callin' mine
the Blue Boyd of Happiness.

96
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,121
Can I tempt you?

97
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,129
Not bad.

98
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,631
Really.

99
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,636
Oh, hey, that's delicious.

100
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,138
Now all I got to do
is fill out these forms

101
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,641
and register with
Bartender's Monthly Magazine,

102
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,143
and my name will be a household word.

103
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,646
Yeah: doorknob.

104
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,648
Hey, Sam, you want to try my new drink?

105
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,149
Woody, I can't touch that stuff.

106
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,651
I'm an alcoholic.

107
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,536
You are?

108
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,905
Oh, I... I'm sorry.
I-I thought you knew.

109
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:51,908
Yeah, I drank myself out of
baseball and out of a marriage.

110
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:53,910
Gee, that's hard to believe.

111
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,795
Well, it's true. Right, gang?

112
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,797
Yeah... Guy had a face full of booze...

113
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
No, no, no, I believe

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,301
you were a drunk, Sam.

115
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,169
I just didn't know you'd been married.

116
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,841
Mmm, pretty good Blue Moon.

117
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,310
You mean it's already a drink?

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
Aw, don't feel
disappointed there, Woody.

119
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,814
Every combination in the world's
been done to death by now.

120
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,316
You couldn't possibly
invent anything new.

121
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,317
(phone rings)

122
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
DIANE: Hello, Cheers.

123
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
Hey, Woody, gin and tonic.

124
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,238
Oh, uh, somebody's
already invented that.

125
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,693
No, you horseshoe, I'm ordering one.

126
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,697
Oh, no! Really?

127
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,199
Tonight? Oh!

128
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,701
Oh, I can't wait!

129
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,703
Yes, thank you.

130
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,206
Oh! I have the most
exciting news, everyone.

131
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,209
Tonight I am eating dinner at The Cafe.

132
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,712
Ah, gee, that's pretty exciting.

133
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,214
Tonight I'm driving home in The Car.

134
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,720
No, you see, um... actually, Sam,

135
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,723
The Cafe is one of the
trendiest restaurants.

136
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,192
Eating there is considered,
uh, to be rather a coup

137
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
among certain, oh...

138
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,695
self-important and pretentious circles.

139
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,564
Congratulations, Diane.

140
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,317
If this place is so hot,
how come they can't think

141
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:10,820
of a better name than The Cafe?

142
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,822
Oh, Carla, if you had
any sense of style,

143
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,824
you would know that
a simple name connotes

144
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,826
the very best of taste.

145
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,327
Hey, you're right about that, Diane.

146
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,329
There's this joint out
on Route One called "Eat".

147
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,333
Don't miss it. It's great.

148
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:27,837
Say, you know, Darlene and
I can't make up our mind

149
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,840
whether to have some
chili or a hamburger.

150
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,842
Maybe this Cafe joint
sounds just like the ticket.

151
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,343
Well, you got the number there?

152
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:36,345
(laughing)

153
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,848
What? What's the number? What?

154
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,350
Pardonne mon laughteur, Sam.

155
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,352
This is not the sort of place

156
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,855
you just call and make a reservation.

157
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,357
My dinner companion is a Brundage,

158
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,358
and even with that pull,

159
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,360
he had to wait three months for a table.

160
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,864
Ooh, geez, I wonder how long
he had to wait for the chairs.

161
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,834
Look what I'm dealing with.

162
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,336
You consider food as a fuel

163
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,338
to be salted down heavily,

164
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,840
covered with ketchup,

165
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,341
stuffed in your mouth,

166
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,343
and on a good day, chewed.

167
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,180
What I'm trying to say is, Sam,

168
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,683
you couldn't possibly get a
reservation at this late hour.

169
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,688
Diane, I can get a reservation
in any restaurant I want.

170
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,189
The name "Sam Malone"

171
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,192
still carries a little
clout in this town.

172
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,193
Right. Hey, hey, hey.

173
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,695
Very well, Sam.

174
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,696
Let's give it a try.

175
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,698
Allow me to call The Cafe.

176
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,199
Well, now, li-lis...

177
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,201
I'm not even sure I want to go there.

178
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,486
Afraid, Sam?

179
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,406
They have not built the
restaurant that can scare me.

180
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,909
Come on. Um, yes, hold on, please.

181
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,414
Um, hello, uh, I'd like to
make a reservation, please.

182
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:46,666
Nothing tonight?

183
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,386
Well, this happens to
be Sam "Mayday" Malone,

184
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,389
formerly of the Red Sox.

185
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,391
Well, yeah, that'll be fine.

186
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,677
8:00? Well, let's say 8:00.

187
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,562
Thank you very much.

188
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,064
Hey, all right, Sammy. You got it, huh?

189
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,984
Sure did.

190
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,352
When, next March?

191
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,771
No, next February.

192
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,775
Well done, Sam.

193
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,279
God, I hate it when she's right.

194
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,781
Ah, you didn't want to
eat there anyway, Sam.

195
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,783
The waiters pride
themselves on rudeness,

196
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,786
the portions are too small, and
it's exorbitantly overpriced.

197
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,288
Oh, you couldn't get in either, huh?

198
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,290
Not till April.

199
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,760
Well, I certainly hope
Diane had a big lunch.

200
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,764
Hi, I'd like to, uh,
cancel a reservation

201
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,765
for tonight, please.

202
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,266
The name is Brundage.

203
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,268
Party of two.

204
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,770
Yes, that Brundage.

205
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,272
Thank you.

206
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,107
Uh-uh,
uh-uh, Sammy.

207
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,559
Canceling Diane's reservation?

208
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,561
CLIFF: Ooh, heart of stone.

209
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,562
I love it.

210
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,564
Yeah, hi, this is, uh, Sam Malone again.

211
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,566
I'm just wondering if you might've had

212
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,068
a surprise cancellation for tonight.

213
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,570
What do you mean, you don't?

214
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,572
You must have. I just...

215
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,574
No, no, n-never mind, never mind.

216
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,993
Boy, I'd sure love to waltz

217
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,494
into that joint tonight

218
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,997
just so I could see
the look on her face.

219
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,917
Well, if it's that important
to you, Sam, give me the phone.

220
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,420
If Julian Weinstein, my good friend,

221
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,421
can't get you in, nobody can.

222
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,923
Ooh, the heart transplant wizard?

223
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,425
Oh, one and the same, yeah. We
went to prep school together.

224
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,929
He's a well-known gourmet.

225
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,931
Yeah, well, wh-why would he
want to do this for me, though?

226
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,432
He'd love to do me a favor.

227
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,434
See, we dissected our
first frog together.

228
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,438
Hello, Julian. Julian, hi.

229
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,408
Frasier Crane. How are you?

230
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,409
Crane.

231
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,913
C-R-A-N-E.

232
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,834
Yes, yes, Dr. Frasier
Crane. All right, fine.

233
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,336
Uh, listen, I was wondering
what you know about, uh...

234
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,339
No, it's A-N-E!
Oh, skip it!

235
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,843
I'll tell you, you know,
you open a few thoraxes,

236
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,845
you forget who your friends are.

237
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,936
Oh, it's beautiful.

238
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,939
A feast for the eyes
as well as the palate.

239
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,441
Ah, that must be our table.

240
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,444
Uh, the Brundage party.

241
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,815
Brundage?

242
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,567
Ah, Brundage.

243
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,952
You canceled.

244
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,903
(laughs)

245
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:22,405
That's impossible.

246
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,406
I-I made the reservations

247
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:24,407
over three months ago.

248
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,409
Well, obviously, there's
been some mistake.

249
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,295
The best we can do is give
you the next available table.

250
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,997
And when might that be?

251
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,884
If all goes well, perhaps... tonight.

252
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,386
Perhaps?

253
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,805
Jordan, don't make a fuss, please.

254
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,307
We'll straighten this out.

255
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,308
He's sorry.

256
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,809
(laughs)

257
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,814
Dr. Weinstein, your table is ready.

258
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,317
Excuse me, Miss.

259
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,247
I don't believe it.

260
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,248
Oh, neither do I.

261
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,251
I was this close to
Dr. Julian Weinstein.

262
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,755
That's not Julian Weinstein.

263
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,758
That's the man who
stole our reservation.

264
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,260
That's not Julian Weinstein.

265
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,762
That's an imposter.

266
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,764
Ask him for his I.D.

267
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,766
Ask him to spell I.D.

268
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,571
Do you know how to order
in a place like this?

269
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,073
Oh, yeah, yeah, my, uh, friend Frasier

270
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,575
read a review about the menu.

271
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,076
He coached me.

272
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,077
No problem.

273
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,580
Dr. Weinstein.

274
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,581
Uh-uh,
uh-uh.

275
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,083
You swine.

276
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,451
It's one thing to pretend

277
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,253
to be somebody else on the phone,

278
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,756
but convincing others that
you're a sophisticated gourmet

279
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,758
is a little bit more
than you can handle.

280
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,259
You're going to blow it, Sam.

281
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,261
You're going to be
embarrassed in front of some

282
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,763
of the most important people in Boston.

283
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,715
And then you're going
to slink out of here

284
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,217
with your curly little
swine tail between your legs.

285
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,722
You don't think I can handle this?

286
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,723
Well, just watch.

287
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,724
Excuse me, we'd like to start off

288
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,226
with Bouchées Parmentier au Fromage,

289
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,728
followed by a salade maison,

290
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,612
and for our entrée,

291
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,481
we'll have Tourte Froide
D'Anguille Rabelais.

292
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,983
Thank you so much.

293
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,987
Good, Sam; that was your busboy.

294
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,492
I knew that.

295
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,493
He's got lips.

296
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,495
He can tell the waiter, can't he?

297
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,999
Bon appetit, Dr. Weinstein.

298
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,003
Who's Miss Grumpus?

299
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:39,508
Excuse me, uh, you aren't, uh,
Dr. Julian Weinstein, are you?

300
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,012
Uh... yes.

301
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,513
(chuckles softly)

302
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,015
This is really an honor.

303
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
I'm, I'm Dr. Peter Fisher.

304
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,518
Oh.

305
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,020
Uh, nice to meet you.

306
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,522
Yeah. You know, I had no
idea you were so young.

307
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:58,027
Well, I, uh, skipped a
few grades in med school.

308
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:00,996
(laughing)

309
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,500
You got to have a sense of
humor in this line of work.

310
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,001
Say, if you'll indulge
in a little shop talk,

311
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,504
uh, where did you come
up with that concept

312
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,506
of combining antithymocyte globulin

313
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:14,009
with, uh, cyclosporin A
to combat tissue rejection?

314
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,514
On the beach.

315
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,520
(uncomfortable chuckle)

316
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,522
Nice meeting you.

317
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:27,523
Excuse me, Dr. Weinstein.

318
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:28,524
Oh, uh, yeah, here we go.

319
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,025
Our chef Claude would like to say hello.

320
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,527
He met you while he
was a chef at La Ronde.

321
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:32,828
Do you mind?

322
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:36,031
Oh, uh... well, actu-actually...

323
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,032
It won't take but a moment.

324
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,534
Maybe, uh... Grab your purse.

325
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:39,535
We've got to get...

326
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,037
Dr. Weinstein, so good...

327
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,540
You're not Dr. Weinstein.

328
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,541
Yes, I am.

329
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,997
Perhaps you hadn't
heard about my accident.

330
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,833
Why, no, I didn't.

331
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,219
Oh, yes, yes, uh... terribly disfigured.

332
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:00,222
Uh, thank God for plastic surgery.

333
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,423
Oh, I'm so sorry.

334
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,758
But they've done a wonderful job.

335
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,759
Hmm...

336
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,644
You look much better.

337
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,813
And taller.

338
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,067
Traction. It, uh...

339
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,939
Well, nice to see you again.

340
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,940
You, too.

341
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,945
Boy, you pulled it off.

342
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,446
Mm. That's pretty smart.

343
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
Yeah, well, of course I'm smart.

344
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,448
I'm a doctor.

345
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,451
(laughing): Oh! Right.

346
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,677
All right, whiskey,
vermouth, bitters--

347
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,679
that's a Paddy Cocktail.

348
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,049
Gin, vermouth,
grapefruit juice--

349
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,434
that's a Palm Beach.

350
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,520
Oh, wait a minute.

351
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,024
How about gin, vermouth
and black coffee?

352
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,730
That's paint remover.

353
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,983
All right, I'll try something else.

354
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,785
Oh, great, I'm out of limes.

355
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:04,286
Don't panic.

356
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,788
Sam always keeps some extras around.

357
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:06,655
Where?

358
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,574
Call the doctor

359
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,075
and find out.

360
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,920
Telephone for Dr. Weinstein.

361
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,922
Oh, um...

362
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,306
It's a Dr. Woody.

363
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,729
He's in the middle of surgery,

364
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,231
and he says he needs your opinion.

365
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,233
Thank you.

366
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,235
Hello?

367
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,737
Wha-what? You're out of them?

368
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,740
No, look, just, just check in the box

369
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,742
right next to the scotch...

370
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,280
...uh, tape.

371
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,281
The scotch tape.

372
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
We, uh...

373
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,284
Sometimes we run out of stitches

374
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,786
and have to improvise.

375
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,541
Thank you, Dr. Woody.

376
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,049
Dr. Weinstein?

377
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,051
My date needs medical attention.

378
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,552
Can you help?

379
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,805
My food just arrived.

380
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,607
Well, I'm a doctor.

381
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,609
Sit down.

382
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,112
I-I want the world-famous
heart surgeon,

383
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,113
Dr. Julian Weinstein.

384
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,115
Well, of course; I bow
to his greater skill.

385
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:23,983
No, no, no, uh,

386
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,452
why don't you go ahead there,
Fisher, and give him a shot?

387
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,205
He's having chest pains, Doctor!

388
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,491
Oh, well, uh, why don't you time them

389
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,376
and see how far apart they are?

390
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,384
All right, I'll, uh, give
him a look-see, I guess.

391
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,886
Right this way, Doctor.

392
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,888
Everything'll be all right. Don't worry.

393
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,391
What are you doing?

394
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,893
You're ruining my dinner.

395
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,895
Ruining your dinner?

396
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,897
Ruining your dinner?!

397
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,899
Everybody, now...

398
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,904
Sam, this is the cruelest
thing you've ever done!

399
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:03,405
Yeah, what about the crummy thing

400
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,406
you did to me earlier today,

401
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:05,908
making me feel like a big nobody?

402
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,914
I apologize.

403
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,415
I spoke irrationally.

404
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,417
You're not a nobody.

405
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,418
(sighs)

406
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:17,419
Now, will you

407
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,921
and your date kindly leave

408
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,923
so that Jordan and I can
have our rightful meal,

409
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,425
and the two of you can
sashay over to the Colonel's

410
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:24,927
across the street?

411
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,430
Will you excuse me?

412
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,299
My meal is getting cold.

413
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,267
Now...

414
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:40,275
Well, we may have a
long wait ahead of us,

415
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:45,280
but we are going to
stay until we get seated.

416
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,783
No, you're going to
stay until you get seated.

417
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:51,286
Right about now a bucket of extra
crispy doesn't sound half bad.

418
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:02,081
Okay, Dr. Crane, just drink up.

419
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,583
Woody, please, you promised you'd stop

420
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
after the rum and trail mix.

421
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,672
That wasn't a drink.

422
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,674
That was just something
to cleanse your palate.

423
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,177
Now come on, here.

424
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,680
My God, Woody!

425
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,681
That bad, huh?

426
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,683
No, no, it's terrific.

427
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,684
Here, try this.

428
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,187
I've never had anything like it.

429
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,441
All right!

430
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,193
Oh!

431
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
Oh, yeah!

432
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,163
This one gets you

433
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,914
in the cocktail hall of fame!

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,334
So, what's in it, Wood?

435
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,202
Yeah, what's the secret recipe?

436
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,671
Well, it's, uh, two parts...

437
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,628
(crying)

438
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,603
Your change, Dr. Weinstein.

439
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,605
Ah, thank you very much.

440
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,112
Whew, boy, remember the good old days

441
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,115
when you could spend $200 for a meal

442
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,618
and then still have enough change

443
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,620
to buy a mint patty?

444
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,124
Ah, Paul, memorable.

445
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,629
Aw, gee...

446
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,498
(cries out)

447
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,468
Madam, we've had our last seating.

448
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,387
I'm afraid we won't be able to
accommodate you this evening.

449
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,890
Oh, Paul, uh... could I
speak to you for a minute?

450
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,892
I'll meet you outside.

451
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:40,896
Listen, it, it would be a
great personal favor to me,

452
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:42,397
Dr. Julian
Weinstein--

453
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,400
in fact, to the entire Weinstein family,

454
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,904
and pretty much to doctors
all over the world-- if...

455
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:52,274
if you could, uh, make
sure she gets some food.

456
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,612
Well, uh, if you'll agree to honor us

457
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,614
with your presence again, Dr. Weinstein,

458
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,032
I'll see to it personally.

459
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,283
SAM: Well, I appreciate that.

460
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
Enjoy, Diane.

461
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,120
Thank you. I intend to.

462
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,677
Thank you. This will do nicely.

463
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,683
Would you like to hear our menu?

464
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,184
Thank you, no.

465
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,686
I've memorized it.

466
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,556
I'll have the Tournedos Rossini.

467
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,559
I'm sorry, we're all out of that.

468
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,864
Uh, then I'll have the
Jambon Farci et Braise.

469
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,366
Once again, I'm sorry.

470
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,070
Let's attack this
from another direction.

471
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,956
You tell me what you have left.

472
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,741
Fricadelles de veau a la Nicoise.

473
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,128
Great, I'm in a Fricadelle mood.

474
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,720
Hi.

475
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,723
What are you doing here?

476
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,591
Well, I'm still hungry, actually.

477
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,894
What happened to, uh, Darlene?

478
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,230
Oh, I put her in a
cab and sent her home.

479
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,517
Well, you don't have
to do me any favors.

480
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,985
No, I'm not doing you any favors.

481
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:10,986
I-I'm really hungry.

482
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,404
May I, uh,

483
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,406
join you?

484
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,907
I don't care what you do.

485
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,909
Well, thank you.

486
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,117
Thank you, Sam.

487
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,918
You're welcome.

488
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,755
Doctor. Ah, Paul.

489
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,256
Can I get you anything else?

490
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,125
Uh, what do you have?

491
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,594
Anything for you, Dr. Weinstein.

492
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,595
Ah, well...

493
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,098
You know, I just can't make up my mind.

494
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,100
Why don't you have my dear friend Claude

495
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,101
mix me up something special?

496
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,102
Very good.

497
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,104
(chuckling)

498
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,110
I really do appreciate
your coming back, Sam.

499
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,612
It was sweet.

500
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,113
No, no, it's not sweet.

501
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,115
I... I did it for myself.

502
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,116
I was feeling guilty out there,

503
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,618
and I don't like to feel guilty.

504
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,620
Well, that's sweet in itself.

505
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,121
Well, we'll see how
sweet you think it is

506
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,123
when I have you pay for your own meal.

507
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,133
Madam. Doctor.

508
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:20,138
Everything was delightful
and well worth the wait.

509
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,140
Ooh, yes, I enjoyed it very much.

510
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,688
I'll be right with you.

511
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,192
Say, uh, I seem to be running
a little short on cash.

512
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,695
You know, Sam, I think it
was a really good idea you had

513
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,080
about us going Dutch.

514
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,832
See, this way, we don't feel

515
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,333
that we owe each other anything.

516
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,835
This is not funny.

517
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,838
This could be very embarrassing
for both of us. Please.

518
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,841
Why? I've already paid for
my meal, and I'm leaving.

519
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,011
Good night, Dr. Weinstein.

520
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:00,879
See you in surgery.

521
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,347
Hey, I'm serious.

522
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,348
Hey, come on, don't do this!

523
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,350
MAITRE D': Is there a problem, Doctor?

524
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,855
No, no, no problem at all. Um...

525
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,357
I'll just use my credit card here.

526
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,859
Mm, very well.

527
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,864
Uh, Dr. Weinstein, this appears to be

528
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,366
the credit card of a Mr. Sam Malone.

529
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,368
Let me see that.

530
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,871
Well, I'll be darned.

531
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,873
You know, I must have,
uh, switched wallets

532
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,374
with this Malone character.

533
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,376
You know, I bet it happened at the club.

534
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,378
Yes, it did; I remember him now.

535
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,881
A baseball player. Malone.

536
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,383
You, uh, you ever heard of him?

537
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,886
No.

538
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,389
Oh, well, why don't you, uh, put it on

539
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,892
this credit card anyway,
and I'll take this Malone guy

540
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,393
out to dinner some other time, hmm?

541
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,895
I'm afraid not.

542
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,396
Well, all right, I don't suppose

543
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,398
you take a personal check, do you?

544
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,901
And whose name would be on that?

545
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,904
Okay, well, uh, why
don't we try this, then?

546
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,772
Oh, my God, look at
the size of that cat!

547
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,025
Hey, you, come back here!
