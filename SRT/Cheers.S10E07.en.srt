00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,506
Hey, Miss Howe, I was over
at the magic shop today,

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,608
and look what I got
for Halloween. Aah!

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,680
It's the old
bloody thumb!

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,948
Yuck!

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,316
You just hide it somewhere,

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,284
and then get ready for the fun.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,856
This was a Halloween night
tradition around our house.

9
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,859
Woody, please don't tell
me how that got started.

10
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:29,395
I thought we could use it
tonight to scare the guys

11
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,562
from Gary's
Old Towne Tavern.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,165
Woody, it's not
scary, just gross.

13
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,534
That's 'cause
you haven't seen it in action.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,971
I'll try it out
on Mr. Peterson.

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,073
Wood, can I
have a refill?

16
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,541
Sure thing,
Mr. P.

17
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,410
Way ahead
of you.
All right.

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,412
Yuck.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,584
What the hell is that?

20
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,320
The old bloody thumb.

21
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,922
Didn't it scare you?

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,392
No, actually, Wood, it's really
more gross than anything else.

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,694
Told you.

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,895
Here's another beer, Norm.

25
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,164
Thank you,
Rebecca.

and stay ready for 'em.

Ten-four, Sammy.

46
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,949
Listen to you people.

47
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,951
Every Halloween,
you go on this ridiculous alert,

48
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,187
waiting for Gary
and the deadbeats from his bar

49
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,922
to come over here and scare you.

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,724
I mean,
you're tense all day,

51
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,925
you're checking
under the tables,

52
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,493
you're even afraid
to go to the bathroom.

53
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,062
Well, we go upstairs
to Melville's.

54
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,166
Hey, it's once a year.

55
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,501
Well, I think you guys should
just call it off; I mean,

56
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,803
I think it's
really childish.

57
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,137
Excuse me? Childish?

58
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,739
Sweetheart, this is

59
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,441
bar versus bar.

60
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,210
We will use any weapon
available to us.

61
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,013
Water balloons, stink
bombs, whoopee cushions

62
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,514
and fake vomit.

63
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,516
Yes, fake vomit.

64
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,588
Now, how childish is it?

65
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,690
Remember last year, we
sent Cliffy over there

66
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,525
wearing nothing but
a pair of Speedos?

67
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,727
(all laughing,
snickering)

68
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,330
Those people were
screaming like banshees.

69
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,999
(laughs)
Yeah.

70
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,368
Well, I was making
a scary face.

71
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,872
Hey, Sam, I'm back.

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,973
CARLA:
Oh, look,

73
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,641
a bumpkin with a pumpkin.

74
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,478
Yeah, it's from
my building's roof garden.

75
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,880
I entered this contest
the local merchants are throwing

76
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,548
for the best jack-o'-lantern.

77
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,050
First prize is

78
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,953
a cruise around
Boston Harbor.

79
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,055
They say it's three hours
you'll never forget.

80
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,891
Especially if it's low tide.

81
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,226
LILITH:
Woody,

82
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,594
it's hard to believe you grew

83
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,195
such a hardy specimen
in the city.

84
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,198
Well, yeah, the trick
is to give it lots of care.

85
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,500
I took a seed

86
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,702
from last year's pumpkin,
planted it,

87
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,671
and watched over it
like a daddy.

88
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,973
I'd even lie in bed
at night thinking,

89
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,908
"I wonder how
the pumpkin's doing."

90
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,980
Pruned it, weeded it,
checked the soil.

91
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,416
I even talked to it.

92
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,518
I think they like that.

93
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,054
Aah!

94
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,424
Farm boys love their Halloween!

95
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,863
I always hated this night.

96
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,865
Why?
Well, when I was a kid,

97
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,467
my folks used
to move around so much

98
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,269
that they never really got
to know the neighbors,

99
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,704
so they didn't trust them.

100
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,006
So when all the other little
kids had their costumes on,

101
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,240
and they were
trick-or-treating,

102
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,543
all I was allowed to do
was stand at our front door

103
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,711
and pass out candies.

104
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,779
I could hardly wait
till I was an adult,

105
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,314
so I could enjoy Halloween,

106
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:46,218
you know, and not spend all
my time serving everybody else.

107
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,454
Ah. That's too bad.

108
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,456
Could you pass those
pretzels, please?

109
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,692
(moaning):
Darn!

110
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,132
I sympathize
with Rebecca's parents.

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,267
I, for one, will not
allow my child

112
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,404
to go trick-or-treating through
the dangerous city streets.

113
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,739
What luck!

114
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,008
I got the last Spider-Man
costume for Frederick!

115
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,077
And look what he
can use for webs.

116
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,419
Frasier, we need
to have a discussion.

117
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,623
Oh. no, don't tell me

118
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,593
you have a thing
against Halloween, too.

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,396
I don't have a thing
against Halloween.

120
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,964
I just don't
want my child

121
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,932
panhandling door-to-door

122
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,834
accepting non-nutritious snacks

123
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,337
from strangers,
dressed in a silly costume.

124
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,173
<i>But, darling,
that is Halloween.</i>

125
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,042
Oh.

126
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,245
Well, then I guess
I do have a thing against it.

127
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,579
I got an idea.

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,214
Why don't you bring
the little fella by the bar?

129
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,816
We can, you know,
set up candy here and stuff.

130
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,017
It'll be fun.

131
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,787
Well, I suppose

132
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,456
if it's an environment
which we know and trust,

133
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,991
that would be all right.

134
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,026
I am not serving
the little punk, Sam.

135
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,695
I know.

136
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,962
It's all right.

137

00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,426
that he'll never set foot
in this bar again.

180
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,627
All right!
All right, all right!

181
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,795
What are we
gonna do?

182
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,097
Soap his windows!

183
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,304
You going for, like, a mild
irritation sort of thing?

184
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,605
Oh, all right,
all right, all right.

185
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,240
You know, that was
just my first idea. Uh...

186
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,542
All right.
All right,
yeah, all right.

187
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,710
All right.
CARLA:
What? What?

188
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,977
NORM:
What do you got?

189
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,979
(chuckling)
Hey!

190
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,348
CLIFF:
All right!

191
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,949
We have a lot of Chinese food
delivered to Gary's.

192
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,117
Yeah?

193
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,519
And not Moo Shu,
just the stuff no one likes.

194
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,790
Yeah?

195
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,160
Well, and then, you know,
have to pay for it and stuff.

196
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,596
Sammy...

197
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,431
What?
Look, we gotta think of
something really good.

198
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,466
NORM:
Right.

199
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,401
I mean, just for once,
I'd like to be

200
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,136
on the winning end
of a great scam.

201
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,170
CLIFF:
Well, uh,

202
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,372
just in case,
this morning,

203
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,073
I happened
to put on my Speedos.

204
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,241
Cliff...

205
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,242
No, no, no, no...

206
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,179
Hey, Malone,

207
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,681
I'd like to talk
to you for a second.

208
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,082
(all groaning, booing)

209
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,786
Hey, and I'm really,
really sorry about this jukebox.

210
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,654
That was the vintage one,
wasn't it?

211
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,889
Here. Um...

212
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,291
Oh, I feel awful.
Let me make it up to you.

213
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,727
(through nozzle):
# Do it with me,
do it with me! #

214
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,995
(horn solo blaring)

215
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,398
♪ Come on, Come on! ♪

216
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,999
♪ Do the vampire... ♪

217
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,002
♪ Do the vampire twist... ♪

218
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,470
(song stops)

219
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,538
You're good.

220
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,607
Yes, I know.

221
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,709
Here, I'd like to give
you a blank check.

222
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,611
Whatever the damages,
just write it in.

223
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,945
And I'd also like

224
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,647
to call off all the
pranks for tonight.

225
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,882
What's going on here?

226
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,684
Well, I went to
my doctor today.

227
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,786
He says I have abnormally
high blood pressure.

228
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,354
I'm 225 over 90.

229
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,623
Yeah, he also said
if I don't start
taking it easy

230
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,526
soon, I could end up
a lot worse, so you see,

231
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,661
that's why we got to call off
everything for tonight.

232
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,963
So this is not one
of your pranks?

233
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,032
No, no, no, no-- Sam, I'm
on the level here, okay?

234
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,367
I'm really sorry
about everything, guys.

235
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,069
A round of beers
on me, okay?

236
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,171
Just add it to the
check, Sam, all right?

237
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,339
CLIFF:
Thanks, Gary.

238
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,740
Oh, what are you talking about?

239
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,908
Hey, come on, listen.

240
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,209
Your health's
a lot more important

241
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,544
than a bunch of silly pranks.

242
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,714
Wow, you're really
a great guy, Sam.

243
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,148
Look, I got to go.

244
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,317
My wife's waiting
in the car for me.

245
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,319
She's gonna take me home.

246
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,257
Oh, are we going
after him tonight!

247
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,160
(laughing)

248
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,232
Sam, he just told
you he's sick.

249
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,633
(laughing)

250
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,369
She fell for that!

251
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,937
(mocking tone):
High blood pressure.

252
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,672
My wife's in the car
waiting for me.

253
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,108
Honey, don't you see what
he's trying to do?

254
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,242
He's getting me
to lower my guard.

255
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,477
Oh, this is good,
this is good.

256
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,245
All we got to figure out now is,

257
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,780
is something that'll really
spook him tonight.

258
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,848
CLIFF:
Yeah.
Yeah.

259
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,182
NORM:
Yeah.

260
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,551
Well, Sam, how about using
the old bloody thumb?

261
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
That's pretty scary.

262
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,055
Come on, man,
forget the old bloody thumb.

263
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,556
No chump would
fall for that.

264
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,925
(register rings)
Oh, gee!

265
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,294
Helps to have
the right chump.

266
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,031
Maybe you gentlemen
should be thinking

267
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,165
along the lines
of high-tech.

268
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,233
What do you mean?

269
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,934
Well, a hologram.

270
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,269
You project
a three-dimensional

271
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,238
translucent image of
some ghoulish apparition

272
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,273
right into Gary's,

273
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,108
thereby scaring the
bejeezus out of 'em.

274
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,176
Where'd you
get that idea?

275
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,644
Well, actually,

276
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,913
Lilith and her physics friends
pulled it on me last year.

277
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,749
Geez, I must have pulled
out five fistfuls of hair.

278
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,151
Hee, hee, hee...

279
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,587
So, uh, what do you say,
guys, a hologram?

280
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,755
FRASIER:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

281
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,956
ALL (chanting):
Hologram! Hologram!

282
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,025
Hologram! Hologram! Hologram!

283
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,266
Trick or treat,
everyone.

284
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,936
Well, rather than
let Freddy have

285
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,472
all the fun, we decided
to get dressed up, too.

286
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,207
Who are you guys
supposed to be?

287
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,209
See, Frasier, I told you
they wouldn't know.

288
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,448
Well, I'm Dante
Gabriel Rossetti!

289
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,618
And I'm his sister,
Christina.

290
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,422
The Rossettis are
our favorite figures

291
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,358
from the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood.

292
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,659
CLIFF:
Oh, yeah.

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,594
The Pre-Raphaelites.
Yeah?

294
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,697
Yeah, a group of 19th century
artists and writers

295
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:42,401
who held an almost-childlike
submission to nature.

296
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,502
That's very good, Cliff.

297
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,137
How would you ever
come to know that?

298
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,439
Ah, I came across it
at the library.

299
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,041
Yeah, going
through art books

300
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,244
looking for paintings
of naked babes, huh?

301
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,413
Really liked 'em
fat back then, didn't they?

302
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,050
Freddy is, of course,

303
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,419
bedecked in the garb
of superhero crime fighter

304
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,421
Spider-Man.

305
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,791
LILITH:
Interestingly,

306
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,594
Spider-Man acquired
his supernatural powers

307
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,696
from the bite
of a radioactive spider.

308
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:11,964
I tried to explain

309
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,332
to Frederick what would
happen if one were

310
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,501
really bitten
by a radioactive spider,

311
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,835
but he just cried.

312
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,272
Okay, Fred, time
for trick or treat.

313
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Trick or treat, lady.

314
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,675
Here we go.

315
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,277
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

316
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,546
Hey, mister, trick or treat.

317
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,014
Thank you very much.

318
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,883
Oh, look.

319
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,951
I'd like to tell you
something, young man.

320
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,320
I don't know if you realize how
lucky you are that your parents

321
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,423
let you partake in the better
things of childhood.

322
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,892
You know, I never got
to trick or treat.

323
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,627
I always had
to hand out the candy.

324
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,796
Nobody ever gave me any candy.

325
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,803
Look at that...

326
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,071
Good boy, Freddy.

327
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,039
Thank you.

328
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,675
That's the first time anybody
ever gave me anything.

329
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,711
Thank you, Frederick.

330
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,314
The kid's got a
bagful of Snickers,

331
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,149
and he gives me
a Tootsie Pop.

332
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,587
Oh, boy, do we have
a surprise for Gary.

333
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,322
SAM:
Those physics guys

334
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,491
set up the whole thing;
the hologram's incredible.

335
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,560
What macabre specter
will they be projecting?

336
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,564
Carla's disembodied head
floating over the bar.

337
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,265
(muttering approval)

338
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,767
Scary, huh, Norm?
Yeah.

339
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,169
What would you do if you saw
Carla's disembodied head

340
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,437
floating over the bar?

341
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,538
What I always do.

342
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,007
Call a cab and go home.

343
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,385
Oh, my Lord!

344
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,421
FRASIER:
That would scare even
the most heartiest soul.

345
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,360
Oh...

346
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,796
It's like being in
a haunted house, isn't it?

347
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,399
A haunted house with free taps.

348
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,969
I can't wait
for Gary to see this.

349
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,604
He's gonna
really freak out.

350
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,873
(chuckles)

351
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,474
Oh, here he is now.

352
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,643
Wow!

353
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,645
He was so scared
he passed out.

354
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,981
Gee, I wonder what
we should do.

355
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,616
Well, I think the responsible
thing to do would be

356
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,484
to bring him to
and then, uh, run.

357
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,752
(all laugh)

358
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,388
Hey, guys,

359
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,657
what if the blood
pressure stuff was true?

360
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,092
I mean, that could
be dangerous.

361
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,427
Oh, come on,
give me a break.

362
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,628
He was faking.

363
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,762
He's probably faking now.

364
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,431
Come on,
Gary, get up.

365
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,699
I don't think he can, Sam.

366
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,500
I don't feel a pulse.

367
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,602
Oh, come on, you got
to be kidding.

368
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,338
No, Sam.

369
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,706
Gary's dead.

370
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,883
Good morning!

371
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,151
CLIFF:
Morning, Sam.

372
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,953
It's a dark day.

373
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,588
Oh, come on.

374
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,024
You don't really believe that
Gary's dead, do you?

375
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,726
(gasps):
Do you?

376
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,396
FRASIER:
I beg your pardon.

377
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,430
You were there.

378
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,999
You saw with your own
eyes what happened.

379
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,134
This is Gary we're
talking about.

380
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,369
You can't trust him.

381
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,636
Ever.

382
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,971
He's pulling a stunt.

383
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,139
CARLA:
But the police

384
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,408
and the coroner
confirmed it, Sam.

385
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,843
Oh, no.

386
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,145
No, he-he could've
hired them to trick us.

387
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,514
FRASIER:
Sam, I realize that

388
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,750
Gary's death is
very traumatic for you

389
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,284
and you're-you're obviously
in denial.

390
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,620
No, I am not.

391
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,157
I can't believe you guys.

392
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,358
I'll tell you what.

393
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,693
I'll believe he's dead

394
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,028
as soon as they bury him.

395
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,097
Gary's funeral's
at 2:00 this afternoon.

396
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,001
This is a good one.
This is a good one.

397
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,137
Life is so unfair.

398
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,440
Yes, Woody, very often
we feel that way

399
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,510
when someone close
to us passes on.

400
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,181
I'm talking about the
pumpkin carving contest.

401
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,184
I mean, it had
to be fixed.

402
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,519
You should've
seen the winner.

403
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,054
Teeth going
every which way,

404
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,023
uneven eyes, stupid nose.

405
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,958
You should have seen
this kid's pumpkin.

406
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,563
Sam?

407
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,365
MATT:
Good morning.

408
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,069
I'm Matt, the bartender
from over at Gary's.

409
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,538
Yeah?

410
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,540
We're all kind of in shock,
but I thought I should

411
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,974
come by and give you
something from Gary.

412
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,544
This is good.
Watch this one.

413
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,480
Oh, the bowling trophy.

414
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,015
Gary's prized possession.

415
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,017
MATT:
Gary came back

416
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,119
from seeing you yesterday, Sam,
and all he could talk about

417
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,787
was how concerned you were
over his condition.

418
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,122
He was pretty
touched that

419
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,957
after all this time
of being rivals,

420
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,660
when it counted most,
you really cared about him.

421
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,872
That is so sweet and so sad.

422
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,375
Oh, come on!
Give me a break!

423
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,177
The guy is probably hanging out
around here someplace.

424
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,812
Hey, what're you up
at Melville's, Gary?

425
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,014
Come on down!

426
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,281
(chuckles)

427
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,951
Wow, you are
cold, man.

428
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,653
I was gonna ask you
for a job,

429
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,689
but pfft!-- forget it now.

430
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,359
Now, he's good.

431
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,694
He is really good.

432
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,697
REBECCA:
Sam, stop it.

433
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,965
The game is over.

434
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,733
A man is dead.

435
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,036
You know, it's getting
a little bit embarrassing.

436
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,972
It's time for you to face
the fact that Gary is dead.

437
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,607
That you had a hand
in his death.

438
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,741
We all did.

439
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,109
That's the end of it.

440
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,145
Yeah, maybe you're right.

441
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,480
All right, I admit it.

442
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,082
Waah-waah, he's dead.

443
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,083
(laughs)

444
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,551
Come on, you guys.

445
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,420
Lookit, he's bluffing.

446
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,955
I wonder how far he's really
going to take this thing.

447
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,825
I'll be he's not even in there.

448
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,564
Okay, so he's in there.

449
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,837
I still think
it's a trick.

450
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,806
If he wants to stay
in there and suffocate,

451
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,474
it's fine with me;
it's his funeral.

452
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,009
Oh...

453
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,345
Sam, we'd like you
to be a pallbearer.

454
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,313
Well, why me?

455
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,781
I mean, Gary hated me.

456
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,050
It's a shame you never knew how
much he thought of you, Sam.

457
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,653
He thrived on
your competition.

458
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,888
You brought him life.

459
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,890
Then you took it away.

460
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,294
I don't want to be
a pallbearer.

461
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,595
FRASIER:
Sam,

462
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,997
it's the least
you could do.

463
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,971
Oh, I know what
he's going to do.

464
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,406
All right,
we're walking along here,

465
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,108
all of a sudden,
the coffin opens up,

466
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,642
he reaches out
and grabs my hand.

467
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,645
Yeah, right.
Ooh-ooh, I'm scared, yeah.

468
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,647
Come on, Gare, I got you.
Come on, open up.

469
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,483
(knocks on coffin)
Hello? Come on out, Gary.

470
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,953
(owl hooting in distance)

471
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,335
Come on, Gary.
Enough's enough.

472
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,504
It's getting chilly out here.

473
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,506
CLIFF:
Sammy?
Hmm?

474
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,207
Come on, the funeral's
been over for hours.

475
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,276
No, no, you don't understand.
See, that's the whole thing

476
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,644
about practical jokes,
it's timing.

477
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,646
I know this; I've done this
a thousand times before.

478
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,448
Matter of fact,
if I don't miss my guess,

479
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,016
he'll be coming out...

480
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,619
right about... now.

481
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,121
Right about now.

482
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,657
Come on,
you're milking it, Gary!

483
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,092
Get out of there!

484
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,361
FRASIER:
I don't think he's
coming out, Sam.

485
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,630
Yeah? Well, then I'm...
I'm digging him out.

486
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,765
Come on, Gary.
Come on.

487
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,434
No, you don't understand.
This is a stunt.

488
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,835
No, come on, you can
hear him laughing.

489
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:30,803
He's laughing--
I hear you!

490
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,804
You're laughing,
I know that!

491
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,247
Okay, Gary, I'm back.

492
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,782
You can come out
and scare me now.

493
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,185
Shh-shh! Watch.

494
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,088
Oh, Sam, he's not here.

495
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,892
Oh, my God...

496
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,397
What if he's really dead?

497
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,266
The thought has
occurred to me, Sam.

498
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,272
He's gone.

499
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,907
He's really gone.

500
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,810
Gary had to go out
of his way to prove it to you,

501
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,279
but, yes, Sam,
he's gone.

502
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:18,150
I feel like I've lost
my best friend.

503
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,985
CARLA:
Having Gary around

504
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,121
was, like, the one
thing that always

505
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,923
seemed to pull us
together as a group.

506
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,327
Yeah. Gary really brought out
the best in us, huh?

507
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,996
No, Cliffie, he brought out
the worst in us.

508
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,464
He will be missed.

509
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,001
Boy, I'll tell you,
I've done a lot of things

510
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,204
that I regret, but I'll never
be able to make up for this one.

511
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,973
You know,
maybe it's time I

512
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,142
stopped acting
like an overgrown child.

513
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,645
I mean, a man is dead because
I did not have the maturity

514
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:47,846
to know when to stop.

515
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,015
Never thought
I'd say this, but...

516
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,116
I miss Gary.

517
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,118
He's a... he's a true friend.

518
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,988
That would have made
a better eulogy than

519
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,290
"Get out of there, Gary."

520
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,865
I feel so empty.

521
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,834
(crying)

522
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,504
WOODY:
Excuse me.

523
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,306
(continues crying)

524
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,974
SAM:
Woody, come,
come back here.

525
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,178
Oh, come on, Woody.

526
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,579
God, it's all my fault.

527
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,581
(Woody sobs loudly
in distance)

528
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,352
Hey, Woody, come on, man.

529
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,188
You, you don't want to cry
by yourself in there.

530
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,690
Come on, come on, man.

531
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,759
Come on, listen,
hey, hey, listen to me.

532
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:34,860
Listen to me.

533
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,362
We all feel bad.

534
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,396
(crying continues)

535
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,530
Do you, Malone?

536
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,432
Do you really?

537
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,467
(laughs)

538
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,406
Trick or treat!

539
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,013
You... you were
all in this together?

540
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,516
Hey, the whole city of Boston
was in on this one, Sam.

541
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:00,419
Come on, you're supposed
to be on my side.

542
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,022
It was really funny, Sam.

543
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:05,190
Yeah, but you're

544
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,759
my pal, man.
Come on!

545
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,561
It was really, really funny!

546
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,431
Sammy, I told you.
I told you we wanted to be

547
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,566
on the winning end
of a great scam.

548
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:15,701
That was a clue.

549
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,069
Yeah, but you never
really gave

550
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:20,072
that Chinese food thing
a chance.

551
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,710
Hey, too bad you can't
get back at me, Malone,

552
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,345
but you're a big boy now.

553
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:30,182
You don't want to play pretend
'cause people could get hurt.

554
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,351
Whoops!
This, I believe, is mine.

555
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,419
SAM:
Oh, no, wait!

556
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,421
Hey, the game
is not over, Gary!

557
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,955
Hey, listen, I'm going
to find something

558
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,457
to scare you.
I swear to God I am!

559
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,192
Here, use this, Sam.
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

560
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,594
Bloody thumb!
Bloody thumb!

561
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,064
Whoo! Whoo!
