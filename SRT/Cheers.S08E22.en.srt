     <i>a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:07,689
Good afternoon, everyone.      
 Have i missed anything?

3
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:11,325
Uh, well, we're just having 
    a little bit of spring      
    training debate over here.

4
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:12,861
Mmm.   
         Who do you, uh,

5
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:14,762
who do you pick        
         for the pennant        
         this year, huh?

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,298
Well, if that's not        
     the most loaded question   
     i've ever heard.

7
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:20,401
Uh, who are you            
     all going with,            
     uh, boston, perchance?

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,604
Uh, as coincidence     
         would have it, yeah.

9
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,773
You know, we go through     
    the same charade            
    every year.

10
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,975
Colored by your            
     hometown chauvinism,

11
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,344
you throw statistics           
 and feasibility to the wind

12
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:30,645
and predict boston,

13
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:32,080
and you're usually wrong.

14
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:34,282
Well, i'm going out        
     on a limb this year.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,036
I'm going to be            
     the only one to pick       
     the new york yankees.

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,838
You're not the only one        
 to pick the yankees, frase.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,058
I'm not?                    
 (Carla)                        
 no. Steve picked them, too.

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,310
Hey, woody,                
     is steve back there        
     with you?

19
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,460
(Woody)         
                you bet, carla.

20
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:50,231
[Steve exclaiming      
         in muffled voice]

21
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,202
(frasier)                      
 you didn't let me finish.

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,103
You see,                    
    i--i picked the yankees     
    to lose, you see?

23
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:57,272
I, uh,

24
00:00:58,006 --> 00:00:59,307
i love the red sox.

25
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,209
Don't hurt me, please.

hey, everybody.

34
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,026
Oh, sam,                       
 you're just the guy            
 i've been lookin' for.

35
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:53,011
Why is that, woody?

36
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,496
'Cause you weren't here.

37
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,401
Check this out, sam.

38
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,437
It's a promise ring            
 for kelly.

39
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:03,888
By givin' her                  
 this ring,

40
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,824
i'm makin' a deep              
 and solemn promise

41
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,726
that someday                   
 i'm gonna give her             
 an engagement ring.

42
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,446
That's beautiful, man. 
         That's beautiful.

43
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:13,431
I've given a lot of those  
     to women.

44
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,433
Of course,             
         uh, in my case,

45
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,118
it was a deep              
     and solemn promise

46
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:18,686
that their backs    
            will arch.

47
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,609
So, uh, woodworth,

48
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,446
why the, uh, sudden jump    
    on the old bullet train     
    to commitmentville, huh?

49
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,498
Well, um,                  
     kelly's leavin' tomorrow.

50
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,033
Her dad's sendin' her  
         to europe

51
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,735
to study for a year.

52
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:35,970
I wanna give her this ring 
     so she won't forget me.

53
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:38,906
God, a whole year.

54
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:41,309
I'm gonna be               
     one lost and lonely soul.

55
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:42,444
Mmm.

56
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,612
[Laughing]

57
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:46,748
"bullet train          
         to commitmentville."

58
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,383
You crack me up,       
         mr. Clavin.

59
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,503
Thank you, woody.

60
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,206
Woody, you can't believe       
 that your beloved kelly        
 would actually forget you.

61
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:57,842
Well, i love kelly  
            and all, dr. Crane,

62
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,378
but you gotta admit,           
 she's no rocket scientist.

63
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:05,150
Yeah. I sympathize, woody.

64
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:09,720
I once, uh, experienced        
 a painful separation myself.

65
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:12,790
A woman i cared                
 very, very deeply about        
 left me.

66
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:13,958
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,760
Your mom moved  
                to florida.

68
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,764
She's right.

69
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,836
I think i'm gonna go           
 and give that little cutie     
 a call right now.

70
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,341
Wow.

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,643
Kelly going to study   
         in europe.

72
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,144
Well, it'll be tough   
         on you, woody,

73
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,196
but, boy,              
         what an opportunity    
         for her.

74
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:36,714
Yeah.                          
 You're right,                  
 miss howe.

75
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,500
You know,                  
     and if i know her father,

76
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,251
she's not gonna 
                have to do it   
                like i did.

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,822
Backpacking,            
        hanging out             
        in seedy youth hostels,

78
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,323
hitching rides     
             with sleazy locals

79
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,560
who use            
             their inability    
             to speak english

80
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:51,328
as an excuse           
         to give you directions 
         on your sweater.

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,532
That sweet         
             little kelly girl

82
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,902
will get everything    
         handed to her          
         on a silver platter.

83
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,138
I hope she chokes  
             on europe.

84
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,309
Well, miss howe            
     shouldn't be mad           
     at kelly.

85
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,278
I mean,                 
        it's her dad's idea.

86
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:09,280
He's just          
             sendin' her away   
             to hurt me.

87
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:12,183
Oh, come on, woody.            
 Probably doesn't have anything 
 to do with you.

88
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,786
He probably just wants         
 to prove to his friends

89
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,322
that he's rich enough          
 to send his daughter           
 to a fancy school in europe.

90
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,908
Has it occurred 
                to anyone

91
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:22,761
that kelly might just want 
     the best education         
     money can buy?

92
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,312
Well, that could be,       
     dr. Crane,

93
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,947
but i think                    
 he's sendin' her               
 to europe

94
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,565
to get her away from me.

95
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,883
Why do you think that?

96
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,351
Because he told me so.

97
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,539
Afternoon, everybody.

98
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,091
(All)              
             norm!

99
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,093
Nice cold beer             
     coming up,                 
     mr. Peterson.

100
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,080
You mean, nice cold beer   
     going down mr. Peterson.

101
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,115
Wait a minute.                 
 Not so fast.

102
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:46,818
What?      
 It's time for us               
 to pick our designated driver

103
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,286
for the night.                 
                [Norm groaning]

104
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,354
ok, you all                    
 know the rules.

105
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,841
Write your names down          
 on a slip of paper.

106
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:56,778
Uh, you know, i understand 
     you can, uh, tell a lot    
     about a person

107
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,245
by analyzing           
         their signature.

108
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,031
You ever-- you ever,    
        uh, get into that, doc?

109
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,365
Oh, come on.

110
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,801
I'm a trained psychiatrist,

111
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,069
not some fortune-teller        
 in a cheap carnival tent.

112
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah, well,     
                that's too bad.

113
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:09,824
I always, uh, wondered 
         what my signature      
         said about me.

114
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,892
Mother of god!

115
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:13,928
What?

116
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,201
And the lucky loser is...

117
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,123
yeesh!

118
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,390
Cliff clavin.

119
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:29,677
You all get                 
    to ride shotgun

120
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,512
in a brand-new                 
 postal vehicle.

121
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:33,881
Oh, great.

122
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,250
We'll all have a ride,

123
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,118
but we'll all go           
     to the wrong address.

124
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,405
That better be                 
 the beer talking.

125
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:46,244
Well, cliffie,             
     i guess that's just        
     the luck of the draw, huh?

126
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:47,962
Speaking of draw,  
             sammy--            
                 wait a minute,

127
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:49,063
what's this?   
            What?

128
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,583
What? Give me that.        
             No! Wait a minute.

129
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,818
This says "norm peterson."

130
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,771
[All groaning]         
            hey, wait a minute!

131
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,939
You didn't put this 
            in the hat!

132
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,524
Oh, it's supposed to go        
 in the hat?

133
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,693
[All groaning]

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,261
come on.

135
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:04,562
Look, how many times   
         have you done this?

136
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,865
Well, i'm embarrassed to say   
 this is my very first time.

137
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,733
This is the first time 
         you cheated?

138
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,736
Oh, i thought you meant        
 getting caught.

139
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,406
All right.                 
     Thanks to your good buddy, 
     norm peterson,

140
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:18,142
the first drawing              
 is null and void.

141
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,293
Ok, everybody.

142
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,562
Once again,                
     names in the hat.

143
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,613

 come on.

144
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,699
I'm watching you, peterson.

145
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,184
Don't watch me, 
                carla.

146
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,801
What, you think            
     i like it?

147
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:34,709
All right.

148
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,845
And the lucky loser is...

149
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,315
norm peterson.

150

             well, well, well.

151
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:46,187
Great. Great.      
             First time i enter 
             this damn thing.

152
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,022
You couldn't pick  
             "norm peterson"

153
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,224
or "norm peterson"?

154
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,660
[Mumbling]

155
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,296
well, "frasier crane." 
         At least one person    
         here is honest.

156
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,014
I beg your pardon.             
 I wrote "norm peterson."

157
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,553
I guess you're right.  
         I wrote that.

158
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,292
Hi, woody.

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,179
Oh, hey, kelly.    
             I didn't expect    
             to see you here.

160
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:14,082
Oh, woody, i'm leaving         
 for europe first thing         
 in the morning,

161
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,385
and i wanted to spend          
 every single free minute       
 of the time i have left

162
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:18,686
with you.

163
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,287
That's a great idea.

164
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:22,673
But first,                     
 i have to get my hair done.

165
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,542
Oh, then i have to get         
 my shots,

166
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,877
and i have to buy              
 a new bathing suit.

167
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,413
Oh, and i haven't even         
 started packing.

168
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,015
So what are you saying, 
        kelly?

169
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,684
I guess, bye.

170
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,206
Well, at least we had  
         this time together.

171
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,125
Oh, listen, before you go, 
     there's somethin' i want   
     to give you.

172
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,811
This

173
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,014
is a promise ring.

174

By giving you  
                 this ring,

i'm makin' a promise   
         that someday

176

i'm gonna be giving you 
        an engagement ring.

177
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,807
Oh, woody,                     
 that's beautiful.

178
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,109
Yeah, well, it's been   
        in my family for years.

179
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,060
My dad gave it         
         to some chick on guam.

180
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,417
That--that was         
         before he met my mom.

181
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,836
Oh. Woody, i'll never          
 take it off.

182
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:10,171
Yeah.

183
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:12,940
But why are you                
 giving this to me right now?

184
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,825
Oh, well,                  
     i'm on a break right now.

185
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:18,996
Not since myrna loy 
            and william powell

186
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,998
have i heard           
         such a rich collection 
         of witticisms

187
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,767
exchanged               
        in such a pithy manner.

188
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,569
Was that, that, uh,            
 drunk couple

 in the pool room there?

190
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:28,806
No. Those were the lunts.

191

Well, i'm--i'm givin' this 
     to you

192
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,761
because you're gonna be 
        in europe,

193
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:36,731
and you're gonna be meetin' 
    all those rich dukes        
    and earls

194
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,133
and counts and basies  
         and stuff, you know.

195
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,303
Woody, you have nothing        
 to worry about.

196
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,471
I love you.

00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,192
and besides,                   
 i'll probably be so busy       
 with my studies

199
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,544
that i won't have time         
 for anything else.

Really?                    
     Wh-what are you studying?

         real busy.

Yo, peterson.

No, down to the corner      
    so i can buy a pack of gum.

207

00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:20,157
This is your duty.             
 Now finish your shirley temple 
 and drive him.

 I'll drive you                 
 to get some gum.

         after we get the gum,

why don't i take you           
 on a tour

Can we pick up      
            my kid?

 have to go all the way         
 to europe right now,

218
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,878

 so close and everything.

Nothing. I--i just know 
        how he is.

What do you mean               
 by "is"?

226
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,212
Well, he can be    
             sort of...

227
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,715
you know.

228

What do you mean               
 by "you know"?

Same thing as "is."

I'm not putting down   
         daddy.

233
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,762
Don't call him "daddy."

234
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,515
He's not your daddy,           
 he's my daddy.

235
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,216
Well, it's a good thing,

236
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,018
because my daddy   
             doesn't treat me   
             like a baby.

I'm sorry, kelly.  
             I take it back.

Well, you can                  
 take this back, too.

241
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,596
I can't take this back.

242
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,697
I don't even       
             have a receipt.

243
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,303
Well, then, i guess            
 you'll just have to find       
 the person who has it

244

and give it back to them,

245

so they can return it       
    and get credit.

246
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,159
What's that            
         supposed to mean?

247
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,511
You know what it means.

248
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,679
No, really.            
         What does it mean?

 You can't make up now.

        tell me what it means?

00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,094
I've really blown it           
 with kelly.

270
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,595
Now she's gonna go off

271
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,563
and marry one of those         
 worldly european guys          
 for sure.

272
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,849
Woody, nothing like that's     
 gonna happen.

273
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,067
Really, miss howe?

274
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:01,535
No, woody.

275
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,404
Those wealthy                  
 european royals                
 are not good enough

276
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,790
for princess button-nose       
 and her daddy.

277
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:10,361
So, becks,                 
     what's this thing you have 
     against rich people?

278
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,597
I mean, you're dating       
    a rich guy, and you want    
    to be rich yourself, right?

279
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,216
Yes.

280
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:18,269
And when i am rich,        
     i will stop hating         
     rich people,

281
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,736
and start hating           
     poor people.

282
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,872
It's the american way.

283
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,014
I can't believe it's over.

284
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,716
I can't believe            
     she's leavin' me.

285
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,818
Oh, come on.                   
 What are you                   
 talking like that for?

286
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,071
You gonna give up              
 after one little spat?

287
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,256
What else can i do?

288
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:42,126
Well, you--you can             
 run to her,                    
 hold her in your arms,

289
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,460
and tell her                   
 that you love her.

290
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,696
Come on, man.

291
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,748
That's a great idea.       
     Yeah.

292
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,500
Yeah, that's exactly       
     what i'm gonna do.

293
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,836
(Woody)                        
 see you guys later.            
     Where are you going, wood?

294
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,620
Sam wants me to elope.

295
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,706
No!

296
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,249
Woody, woody,          
         i didn't say anything  
         about eloping.

297
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,052
I didn't mean that.     
        I just meant you should 
        go over to her place

298
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,420
and maybe make out     
         a little bit.

299
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,990
Well, yeah.                    
 And to do that,                
 we gotta get married, right?

300
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,224
Kids today.

301
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,378
Woody--     
 excuse me.                     
 I'll handle this.

302
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,964
Woody, listen to me.

303
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:23,834
I once was deeply in love      
 with a boy that my parents     
 did not approve of,

304
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:27,037
and i thought                  
 about eloping.

305
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,907
But fortunately,               
 i came to my senses.

306
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,109
I mean, can you imagine        
 what would have                
 happened to me

307
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,661
if i had married him?

308
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:35,379
Yeah, maybe         
            you'd be happy now,

309
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,982
instead of whining  
            and being dumped on 
            your whole life.

310
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,886
Go get her, woody.

311
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,138
No, no, no, no, no!

312
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,540
Woody, woody, come on.     
     Stop, here, kid.

313
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,841
Think a little bit.

314
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,094
No, sam.                       
 That's all i've done           
 my whole life,

315
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,079
is think, think, think.

316
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,315
There comes a time             
 when you gotta                 
 stop thinking.

317
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,984
You taught me that, sam.

318
00:13:56,986 --> 00:14:00,004
Well, i--i just want you   
     to be sure, man.           
     That's all.

319
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:02,673
Sam, i am sure.         
        I love kelly.

320
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,025
I'm willing                 
    to risk everything

321
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,444
to make her                    
 mrs. Woodrow tiberius boyd.

322
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,114
Tiberius?

323
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,149
You never told us          
     that was your middle name.

324
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,269
Yeah, right.                   
 I never told kelly, either.

325
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,505
Maybe i'd better               
 just forget                    
 this whole thing.

326
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,689
(Sam)                          
 hey.

327
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,342
Hey, bro, come on. 
 No, no, no,                    
 wait a minute.

328
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:22,976
Now, i-i-i've accepted         
 the fact

329
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,145
that her middle name           
 is susan.

330
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,650
I'm gonna go for it.

331
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:33,203
Oh, hey, sam,                  
 would you come with me?

332
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:35,139
I mean, you're kind of         
 like a big brother to me,

333
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,274
and i don't think              
 i could take a big step        
 like this

334
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,909
without you there          
     to support me.

335
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,628
Ah. Well, thanks, woody.   
     I'm--i'm very touched.

336
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:42,929
Yeah.

337
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,898
I need someone strong       
    to hold the ladder.

338
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:47,567
Thanks, woody.         
         I'm very touched.

339
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,474
[Speaking quietly]             
 that's not her room,           
 either.

340
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,176
Well, what took you 
            so long up there?

341
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:58,145
<i>Ghostbusters</i>                  
<i> was on t.V.</i>

342
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,780
I love that movie.             
                 Oh, yeah.

343
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,882
It's criminal                  
 the way it got snubbed         
 by the oscars that year.

344
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,018
Yeah, it still         
         ticks me off.

345
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,352
Let's try  
                     over here.

346
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,078
Evening, everybody.

347
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:14,979
Norm!

348
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,301
Guess i drove                  
 everyone else home, huh?

349
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,703
That's right.

350
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:25,039
You know, norm,    
             i'm proud of you.

351
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:26,941
I rode you pretty hard     
     for cheating,

352
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,592
but you really came through.

353
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,910
[Sighing]          
             well, thank you.

354
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,345
Now can i have a beer?

355
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,796
Nope, we're closed.

356
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:40,687
All right.                 
     I guess i deserved that,   
     cheatin' the way i did.

357
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:43,790
Tonight actually turned out    
 to be a pretty                 
 rewarding experience.

358
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,225
What are you   
                 telling me,

359
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,061
you liked cartin' those guys   
 all over town?

360
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,695
No, i didn't cart 'em  
         all over town.

361
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,697
I just dropped them all off 
    at your place.

362
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:54,401
Great.

363
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:57,371
I finally get my kids          
 to stop rolling drunks,

364
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,240
and now you have to go         
 and put temptation             
 in their path.

365
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:01,608
I am telling you,

366
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,910
it is impossible           
     to raise a family          
     in the '90s.

367
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,467
Ok.

368
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,602
Something cold and german,     
 perhaps?

369
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,409
[Whispering]       
             good news, woody.

370
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,244
[Whispering]                   
 all right. You finally         
 found kelly's bedroom?

371
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,697
No, i just met     
             the cutest little  
             chambermaid.

372
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,949
She was makin' popcorn. 
        You want some?

373
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,417
Sam, how can you think         
 of popcorn

374
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,486
when my life and happiness     
 are at stake?

375
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,620
It's cheddar.

376
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,156
Ooh, gimme.

377
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,256
Thank you.

378
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,899
(Sam)                  
         ouch!                  
             Oh, sorry, sam.

379
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,037
Yeah. This is   
                kelly's room,   
                all right, sam.

380
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,972
[Gargling]             
         how can you tell?

381
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,240
That's her gargle.

382
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,484
Woody, sam,                
     what are you doing here?

383
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,254
Kelly, i wanna     
             marry you.

384
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,822
I wanna elope with you         
 right now.

385
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,439
You mean everything            
 in the world to me,

386
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:08,208
and nothin' is              
    gonna stop me--

387
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,162
hey, you do have               
 over 1,000 barbie dolls.

388
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,415
I thought you were             
 just braggin'.

389
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:19,987
Woody, i just can't    
         run off and marry you  
         at the drop of a hat.

390
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,656
Boy, this is                
    a great little comb.

391
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:25,926
Teeth aren't too wide,         
 nice flexibility,              
 good heft.

392
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:28,328
I've been looking          
     for one of these           
     for my eyebrows.

393
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,199
That one's for blondes.

394
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,617
For--

395
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,552
[chuckling]                    
 jeez, you are rich.

396
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:39,823
You know,           
            it--it's not right  
            for you to be here.

397
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,775
You shouldn't even be  
         seeing me like this.

398
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,043
I'm not decent.

399
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,678

 Kids, kids, calm down!

409

Why is everybody               
 making such a big fuss         
 about their middle name?

410
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:14,891
What's yours, sam? 
         Hey, shut up.

411
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,746
The point--                    
 sit down here.

412
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:22,216
The point is                   
 that you should be sharing     
 with each other how you feel.

413
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:23,683
Names don't matter.

414
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,019
I'm not saying that            
 you should get married, but--

415
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:30,157
no, no. Let's get married.  
    Oh, that'll be a blast.

416
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:32,226
Well, whether                  
 you get married or not,

417
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,561
what's important is            
 to share how you feel.

418
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,397
How you feel about him,        
 how he feels about you.

419
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,166
Woody, i know                  
 he's your friend and all--

420
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,451
beat it, sam.

421
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:48,775
Boy, g.I. Joe should           
 come here on leave someday.

422
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,619
Kelly, you mean everything 
     in the world to me.

423
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:01,321
And i want you to know  
        that someday            
        i'm gonna give you back

424
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,957
everything you've given up 
     by marrying me.

425
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,377
Oh, woody,                     
 i don't need                   
 all those things.

426
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:11,798
I'd live in a cold-water flat  
 in the seediest part of town   
 to be with you.

427
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,401
Then have i got            
     a surprise honeymoon suite 
     for you.

What are all these

437

Ah, honey.

So, my little kelly-belle  
     is leaving me.

Why do you say that, daddy?

444
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:53,974
I'm not going away.

445

Well, you're going off 
         to europe.

446

Oh, there.

447
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,529
Yeah, well,                    
 i don't think of that          
 as away.

448
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:04,518
Look at you now.

449
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:07,104
All grown-up       
             and beautiful.

450
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:10,107
I can't help but think 
         of a little,           
         towheaded butterball

451
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:11,909
taking her first steps.

452
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,677
Now i'm sending you off 
        to see the world.

453
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,916
And if,             
            when you come back,

454
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:20,383
you still want to be   
         with woody,

455
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,369
well, that'll be fine  
         with me,

456
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:25,122
'cause i'll know       
         you're making          
         a grown-up decision.

457
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,359
But no matter how  
             grown-up you get,

you'll always      
             be my only kelly,

 he's your only daddy!

I'm just some guy           
    with a ladder!

469

But, woody,                    
 what about us?

470
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,256
I can't take away          
     his little butter-headed   
     towball.

471
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,643
I think you should go  
         to europe.

Are you sure, woody?

473

As sure as corn chiggers   
     in august.

Well, if--if that's            
 what you want, woody,

 to europe.

476
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,724
But how will i know            
 you'll still be here for me    
 when i get back?

477
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,060
Well, how 'bout this?

478
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,865
We could get        
            secretly engaged.

479
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,035
Oh, yes, woody.                
 That's a wonderful idea.

480
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:46,853
I-it'll be our special secret.

481
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:49,322
I'll be in europe,          
    and you'll be here,

482
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,409
and we'll have             
     an unspoken bond           
     across the ocean.

483
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:54,778
Oh, that sounds swell.

484

while you're       
             in europe?

486
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,133
Well, woody,                
    if i don't date             
    any other guys,

487
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,836
then people might suspect      
 that i'm secretly engaged.

488
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,457
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

489
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,792

     the same thing             
     back here in the states.

490
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,561
Except, of course,      
        i'll date women.
