1
00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:04,119
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:05,820
Hey, Cliffie.
What you doing?

3
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:09,074
Uh, writing a letter
of application for the Eco pod.

4
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,542
What the heck's the Eco pod?

5
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,744
It's a totally
self-contained environment

6
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:15,881
located in a mile-wide bubble
underneath the desert floor.

7
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,716
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,134
It's gonna be inhabited
by the best and the brightest

9
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:24,372
of the, uh, human species,
so I-I thought I'd apply.

10
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:26,558
They're gonna have a zoo
in there, too?

11
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:28,760
Yeah. Yeah, very
funny, Carla.

12
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,679
You'll be laughing out of
the other side of your face

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,181
when they make me Postmaster
General of the Eco pod.

14
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:37,018
Actually, the Eco pod
does have some scientific merit.

15
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,187
It was designed
by a colleague of Lilith's,

16
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:40,455
Dr. Louis Pascal.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,940
It will serve as a prototype

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,775
for the colonization of space.

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,676
Plus which,
the grant money is incredible.

20
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:47,612
I hear
Pascal's driving a Lexus.

21
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,132
Boy, I sure hope I get a shot

22
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,034
at being sealed
up in that thing.

23
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,886
Say, would a petition help?

24
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,188
It might.

25
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,172
Hey, I'll sign that.

26
00:00:58,173 --> 00:00:59,307
No! I'm first!

27
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,159
Okay...
Boy.

28
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,178
(weepy): You guys are the best
friends a fellow ever had.

Sammy, when is Woody getting
back from his honeymoon?

37
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,946
I've been working
a double shift for two weeks,

38
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,582
and I'm exhausted.

39
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,467
Oh, thank you. Come again.

40
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,904
Oh, my God, who am I?

41
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:07,875
Uh-oh. Isn't that Henri,

42
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,511
that jerk who's always trying
to steal Kelly from Woody?

43
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,580
You know, I just
don't like that guy.

44
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:13,848
Con artist.

45
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,167
Yeah, Mister Frenchie
Two-Face.

46
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,002
Hello, fellows!

47
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,471
Hey, Henri!
How's it going?

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,889
Hey, Henri,
what can I do for you?

49
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,708
Uh, I need a favour, Sam.

50
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,994
I need you to tell
the Unemployment Office

51
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:29,463
that I applied for a job,
and you turned me down.

52
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,265
(laughs) Sammy, come here.

53
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,867
What?
Listen, why don't we hire the guy?

54
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:34,368
That would help me out a lot.

55
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,912
Oh, I-I don't know
about that.

56
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,589
Henri, did you ever tend bar?

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,890
Well, yes, but...
CARLA: You're hired.

58
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,825
No, no,
but you are missing the point.

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,527
You are to turn me down

60
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,512
and send me on my way so that

61
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:47,732
I might spend my afternoon
watching television.

62
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,917
I'm sorry, man,
but I need the help.

63
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,636
Thanks.
(speaks French)

64
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,488
Okay, give me an apron.

65
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:56,157
Oh, mon dieu.

66
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,026
I am filling Woody's shoes.

67
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,961
Oh, the pressure.

68
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:05,800
Well, Henri, let me be
your first customer, okay?

69
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:09,304
I would like a beer, please,
and put it on my tab.

70
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:12,107
Aren't you supposed
to pay when served?

71
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:13,441
Well, as long

72
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,978
as we're bringing up the matter
of debt, Frenchie,

73
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,279
let me bring up a
couple little things

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,198
called World War I
and World War II, okay?

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,484
Now, why don't we
subtract the cost of my puny little beer

76
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:25,987
from the enormous
debt that you owe us?

77
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,255
Okay, okay.

78
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,842
Hey, uh, you came down pretty
hard on him, didn't you, Norm?

79
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,060
Damn it, Cliffie.

80
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,330
My dad was almost in the army.

81
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,016
(whistling)

82
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,923
(indistinct crowd chatter)

83
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,924
Say, can I bum a cigarette?

84
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,358
Yeah, I got one right...

85
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,428
Oh, God! Sam,
I swear, I swear.

86
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:07,595
I can't believe you...

87
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,997
No, this is the only
one that I've had!

88
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,550
You promised me you would
not smoke in the office.

89
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,886
We had a little problem
with that, remember?

90
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,120
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

91
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,822
Whoo! Whoosh!

92
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,673
I know, I know, and
I've tried to quit,

93
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:21,109
but it's too hard-
I just can't!

94
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,111
Yeah, well, you need
some professional help.

95
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:24,445
Oh, wait a minute.

96
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,013
Yeah, here we go.

97
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:28,950
"Smokers Anonymous,"
"Smoke Beaters."

98
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:31,285
Oh, yeah, yeah.

99
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,188
"Doctor Kluger's
No-Mercy Clinic."

100
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,489
Wait a minute.
Let me see that.

101
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,924
Here we are.

102
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,692
Sam, he doesn't even have
an ad; it's just his name.

103
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:39,961
How about going with this one

104
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:42,329
with the cute
little smoking kitty?

105
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,698
Yeah, uh, is this,
uh, Dr. Kluger?

106
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,635
Well, my name's Sam Malone,
and I have an employee

107
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,238
that needs to stop smoking
right this very minute.

108
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,739
Can you help me out?

109
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:55,109
Yeah, tell me
about your program.

110
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,360
Oh! Ow!

111
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,262
Boy, I bet that hurts, huh?

112
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,183
Wow, I bet you really
have to be a doctor to do that, don't you?

113
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,086
Uh, no, no.
It sounds terrific.

114
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,821
Yes, I can.
All right, great!

115
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,289
Thank you very much.

116
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:09,624
Sounds good.
Oh, yeah.

117
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:11,726
I'll fit it in
in my spare time.

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,228
Maybe I'll stop by next week.

119
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,496
No, you don't understand, hon.

120
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,664
We got to get you up
to the sidewalk right now.

121
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,666
They're sending
the, uh, Kluger van.

122
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,834
Oh, yeah.
Van?

123
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,318
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Kluger van?

124
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,504
It'll be good for you.

125
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,904
You'll be all right.

126
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,077
(distant phones ringing)

127
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,081
So,

128
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,335
you're the girl
who likes to smoke.

129
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,620
You don't intimidate me.

130
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,855
I've been to a million
of these places,

131
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,056
and they don't work.

132
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,241
I'm out of here.

133
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:44,475
Oh, well, fine. Go.

134
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,876
You're free to leave.

135
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,211
No doorknob.

136
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,447
(laughs)

137
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,516
Yeah, that's right, Miss Howe.

138
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,269
Because you have the key,
and the key is discipline.

139
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:56,638
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,840
I'm scared.

141
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:02,110
Why don't you just save
yourself some time

142
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,344
and unlock the door?

143
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,313
Uh... all right,
Miss Howe.

144
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,982
Relax. Have a seat.

145
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,817
(chuckles)

146
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,652
Why don't you have a cigarette?

147
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:15,123
In fact...

148
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:19,994
why don't you have,
a thousand cigarettes?

149
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,335
Now...

150
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,521
you are going to smoke

151
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,690
until you can smoke no more.

152
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,559
But I predict you will
not get past 50.

153
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:38,496
No one has ever gotten past 50.

154
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:42,349
I had 50 in the van.

155
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,069
Oh, well,

156
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,357
I can see this is going
to be a challenge.

157
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:52,026
All right, hold my calls.

158
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,971
And so you can
imagine my embarrassment

159
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,241
when I made two dates
for the same night.

160
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:08,993
Uh, what happened when
your two lovelies arrived?

161
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,128
Was there a cat fight?

162
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,064
Oh please, tell me
there was a cat fight.

163
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,149
Of course.

164
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,750
There was a big cat fight.

165
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:18,386
They were very, very naughty.

166
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,789
I don't even know why I kept
letting them up on the bed.

167
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:26,177
Henri, where was the strangest
place that you ever...

168
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:29,263
Oh, that would have to be, uh,
ah, during a performance

169
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,466
in the balcony
at the Paris Opera.

170
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,401
And believe me,

171
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:36,737
it wasn't over
until the fat lady sang.

172
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,989
Very impressive.

173
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:40,308
(chuckles)

174
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,059
And what about you, Sam?

175
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,263
You're supposed to be
a great ladies' man?

176
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,564
All right, let's see,
the strangest place,

177
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,899
that'd have to be,
uh, the back of a car.

178
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,018
Well, that's not so strange.

179
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,688
The car's on an
assembly line, Henri.

180
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,625
You played with me, Sam.

181
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,126
Hey, I like you.

182
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,394
It's nothing personal.

183
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,029
As a matter of fact,
I think of you

184
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,431
as kind of a...
young Sam Malone.

185
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:08,102
Uh, don't you mean, you're
kind of, uh, an old Henri?

186
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,855
No, I don't.

187
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:14,225
Well, but why should
we argue the point

188
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,894
when we can settle it in battle?

189
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,645
(chuckling):
What do you mean?

190
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,831
I suggest a little competition.

191
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,466
All right, here's what we do.

192
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:26,220
We shall collect phone numbers
from beautiful women.

193
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,990
Whoever has the most phone
numbers at midnight

194
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:32,593
will be acknowledged as the
world's greatest ladies' man.

195
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,844
That's a great idea.

196
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,096
Hey, take him, Sammy!

197
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,381
Yeah, put him in his place.

198
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,582
Don't listen to this.
It's a stupid idea.

199
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,733
HENRI:
Oh...

200
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,319
Do I hear a scaredy-cat's tune?

201
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:45,072
Would you grow up, Henri?

202
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,959
Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat,
scaredy-cat.

203
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,193
Hey, hey, stop that.

204
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,828
Hey, please, will ya?

205
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:54,015
Maybe ten years ago I would
have taken this silly bet.

206
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,150
But I'm, I'm older,
and I'm a little wiser.

207
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,918
Oh, well, maybe
you're right, Sam.

208
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,187
Maybe we don't need to compete.

209
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:03,658
(sighs)
I'll simply be king of ladies' men

210
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,393
and you'd be the mayor
of Scaredy-Cat Town.

211
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,613
You'd better hurry.

212
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:12,250
I am about to get
my first number.

213
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,618
Yeah, well, he can get
all the numbers he wants.

214
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,369
I'm not going to
stoop to his level.

215
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,554
Bravo, Sam.

216
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,123
You handled that very well.

217
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:20,825
It's good to see that
you've evolved

218
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,261
beyond the playboy mentality
of bedding every woman you meet.

219
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,362
Times have changed and you've
wisely changed with them.

220
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:26,597
I applaud that.

221
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:29,281
Oh, well, I appreciate that.
Thanks. Thanks very much.

222
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:35,523
Well, the king
of babes is dead.

223
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:39,327
What the hell are
we supposed to do now?

224
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,287
Norm.
Yeah.

225
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,323
Tell the bartender
I need a vodka-rocks.

226
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,509
Sammy, Carla needs a
vodka-rocks and a beer.

227
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:02,049
Carla, will you cut it out with
this "tell the bartender" stuff?

228
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:03,451
It's me, Sam.

229
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,085
Sam is dead.

230
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,839
He died, when he wouldn't take
the challenge from Henri.

231
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,309
You know, that's just childish.

232
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,110
Can we please just talk
about anything

233
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,978
besides this damned bet?

234
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,197
Yeah. Okay, how about this?

235
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:21,034
What would, uh, Metropolis
be like if Superman retired?

236
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,406
Oops! One thing wrong
with that scenario.

237
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:28,242
Superman gives a damn.

238
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,446
I've got two more numbers, Sam.

239
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:34,649
Yeah, well, I'm not
playing, Henri.

240
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,851
You will, Sam, you will.

241
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,385
Yeah? What makes
you think so?

242
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,121
Because I know you, Sam.

243
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,658
Deep down you're a, uh-uh,
babe-hound just as I am.

244
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,392
Admit it.

245
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:50,230
With every phone
number I catch, you die a little inside.

246
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,971
You can deny what you are to
the others, but not to me.

247
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:01,942
Come, Sam, come over
to the dark side!

248
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,333
Just go fill
a pretzel bowl, will you?

249
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:10,768
Okay. Okay.

250
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:15,172
But after they're filled-
come to the dark side!

251
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:20,227
Normie, now that Sammy's dead,

252
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,596
you realize we're gonna
have to live vicariously

253
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,831
through Henri?

254
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,500
No, Cliffie.

255
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:29,970
Just say we stopped living
vicariously through others, huh?

256
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:33,424
What do you say we get
off our duffs for once,

257
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,893
and live ourselves, so
that some other poor slubs

258
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,662
can live vicariously
through us? Huh?

259
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,129
What do you say we...

260
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,131
(laughs) Oh, shoot!

261
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,467
Damn, I nearly got
through it, too!

262
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,169
You were good.
Yeah.

263
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,104
I thought you were gonna do it!

264
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,358
You are the most
beautiful woman

265
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,776
I have ever seen.

266
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,560
It would make
my life worth living

267
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,262
if only I could have
your phone number.

268
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,647
WOMAN:
Sorry.

269
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,998
Nothing personal.

270
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,543
I just don't like French guys.

271
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:02,636
Oh...
(coughs)

272
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:03,971
(with American accent):
Well, uh, that's, uh,

273
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,172
that's just an affectation.

274
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,406
I'm Chuck from Portland.

275
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,796
I-I just figured
you're so sophisticated

276
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,999
that you-you wouldn't
have anything to do

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,834
with plain old me.

278
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,637
You should have more
confidence, Chuck.

279
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:22,556
Maybe this will help
your self-esteem.

280
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:26,560
(with French accent):
I got another one.

281
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,395
Thank you.

282
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:31,498
Sammy!

283
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,100
I am thrashing you soundly.

284
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,168
You better hurry!

285
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,270
You'll never catch up!

286
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,105
Look at Sammy
just standing there.

287
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,158
Maybe Henri's right.

288
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,027
Maybe he is a...
(French accent): scaredy-cat.

289
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:46,446
You guys don't get it, do you?

290
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,281
You know, it's...

291
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:50,918
I've done all this
babe-chasing stuff.

292
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,453
All right, here-here's
what it is.

293
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,788
It's like- it's like watching
The Three Stooges.

294
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:55,922
You know?

295
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:57,625
You watch the early ones
with Curly,

296
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:58,946
and they-they were magic!

297
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,595
And then- then you watch
the later ones, you know,

298
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:04,131
where they're using the same
jokes with Curly Joe,

299
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,199
and it just breaks your heart!

300
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,937
See, what I'm saying is...

301
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,271
I guess, you know,

302
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,006
you-you've got to move
with the times.

303
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,392
That's all.

304
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,078
Well, listen to the scaredy-cat
knocking Curly Joe.

305
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,732
I got another one, Sam!

306
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,601
Hey! Hey! The whole issue
is closed, Henri.

307
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,036
I'm not taking the bet.

308
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,321
Oh, very well, I give up.

309
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,790
I won't bother you again.

310
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:33,327
After all, what can I expect
from an American?

311
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,913
You are all fat, lazy,

312
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,248
stupid.

313
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,501
All you want to do is watch TV,
eat fast food

314
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:42,587
while your easy women
are scooped up

315
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,139
by handsome foreigners
like myself.

316
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:48,009
That tears it!

317
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,844
You've just drawn blood
on the US of A, pal!

318
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:54,265
Cliff, calm down.
Calm down, nothing!

319
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,851
Sammy might be missing
in action,

320
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,819
but on behalf of
this great nation,

321
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:00,487
I'm gonna go out there

322
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:01,972
and collect more
telephone numbers

323
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:03,590
than that sleazy Frenchman!

324
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,745
What about it, men?
Are you with me?

325
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,330
You know,
I'm usually afraid of girls,

326
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:13,000
but it's for America!

327
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:15,703
Me, too!

328
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:16,637
Then let's go!!

329
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,873
Hey, fellows, fellows, fellows!

330
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:21,408
All right, please,
take your seats.

331
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,881
Okay, Henri, you're on.

332
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,817
Carla, get the babe kit.

333
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,085
(gasps)

334
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,806
Not the babe kit!
Sam, are you sure?!

335
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,108
Yeah.

336
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,310
Oh, but, Sammy,
he's just a kid!

337
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,844
He didn't know!

338
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,400
Maybe it's time
he grew up, Carla.

339
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:49,103
Oh, but Sammy,
you told me never to get the babe kit!

340
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:56,727
Henri, you shouldn't have
brought America into this.

341
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,480
Ooh! The babe kit!

342
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,832
I'm shaking!

343
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,584
(laughs)

344
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:07,004
What is this babe kit?

345
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:08,171
Tell me.

346
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,925
Tell me!

347
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,646
ALL: Scaredy-cat, scaredy-
cat, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat!

348
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,431
Okay, Carla, I'm ready.

349
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,633
Bring in the kit.

350
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,475
Before you open this thing,

351
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,610
I want you to know
this is a one-shot deal,

352
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:31,779
tonight only.

353
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:36,584
In this box
is the Sam Malone I used to be.

354
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:39,720
Sammy, if you've outgrown
all this stuff,

355
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:40,871
why do you keep it?

356
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:44,591
I thought maybe one day
I'd have a son.

357
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:56,820
(gasps)

358
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,441
Sam! Oh!

359
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,810
Sam!

360
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:05,578
The first edition of your
little black book.

361
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:08,081
Yeah.
Oh!

362
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,883
(gasps)

363
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:12,452
Your Members Only jacket!

364
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:20,327
Oh, Sammy, a picture
of you and Elvis!

365
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,496
Yeah, yeah.
The chicks really love that.

366
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,632
What kind of cologne is that?

367
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,634
It's a special blend;

368
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:31,538
Old Spice, Hai Karate
and something that takes spots out.

369
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,940
I'm not really sure.

370
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:36,477
Well, I'll leave
you to prepare.

371
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:37,561
Yeah.

372
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:46,720
Every time I think I'm out,
they pull me back in!

373
00:16:56,764 --> 00:17:00,033
So, I wanted to be an artist.

374
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,970
The old man wouldn't have it.

375
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,705
Off to medical school.

376
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:07,508
I could never please him.

377
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:11,011
Aw. Not you, with all
the important work you do?

378
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:16,316
Well, it was never enough.

379
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,354
You poor, poor man.

380
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,755
Mm.

381
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,724
Oh, watch it.
Don't get ashes on my diploma.

382
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:24,775
Oh.

383
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,033
Hey, guys!

384
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,819
Hey.
All right, Fras.

385
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,587
Say what's the, uh,
tote board for?

386
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,522
I thought Sam wasn't gonna take
that bet.

387
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:39,739
Well, he wasn't,

388
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,509
but then Henri turned it
into a big grudge match...

389
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,744
France versus the USA.

390
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,331
At the last hour,
Sam stepped in for our side.

391
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:48,582
Damn, and I missed it!

392
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,417
I was home teaching
my kid to read!

393
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,186
I could kick myself!

394
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,956
Thanks a lot, sweetheart.

395
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:57,558
I-I'll give you a
call next week.

396
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,593
You know, I think
the two of us could be

397
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:00,827
very special
together, Michelle!

398
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:03,197
Or should I say,
uh, number eight? Yeah!

399
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:04,281
(bell dings)

400
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,485
ALL (chanting):
USA! USA! USA! USA!

401
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,602
Wait-wait-wait.

402
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:11,005
Oh, my God!
Is it really you?

403
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,907
Uh, yeah.

404
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,341
Hi.
How long has it been?

405
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,643
Oh I love what you did
with your hair! It's great!

406
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:17,778
Thank you.

407
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,563
Are you still going
with, uh... Oh, shoot.

408
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:20,915
Steve?
Yeah. Steve, right.

409
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,249
No, no,

410
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,718
apparently, he wasn't ready
to make a commitment.

411
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,086
Is that Steve or what?

412
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,253
(both laugh)

413
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:28,488
That's right.

414
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,656
God, you look wonderful!

415
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,926
Hey, give me a hug.
It's great to see you.

416
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,544
Great to see you.

417
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,879
Wait, this is crazy!
This is crazy!

418
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,413
Here, look, give
me your number.

419
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,799
I don't want to lose
touch with you again.

420
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:43,137
You know, I really meant
to call you a couple of times.

421
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:44,171
Here.

422
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:45,472
Well, shame on you for not.

423
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:48,108
Give me another hug.

424
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,042
All right.

425
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:51,812
Bye.
Bye-bye. See you later.

426
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:53,030
Sammy, who was that?

427
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:56,817
How the hell should I know?

428
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:59,537
ALL:
USA! USA! USA!

429
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,972
So how many orphans
did you save?

430
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:07,477
Oh, 15, 16 if you include
their little puppy.

431
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,014
You went back in
to save a puppy?

432
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,815
Well, he was an orphan, too.

433
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,801
Oh!

434
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,553
My card.
HENRI: Oh, thank you.

435
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,120
Uh, could you push
that down for me?

436
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:18,455
Oh, sure.

437
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,931
How am I doing, Carla?

438
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,817
Well, it's all tied up
with, uh, two minutes left.

439
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:30,950
No sweat.

440
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,419
Oh, that's what I like to hear.

441
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,605
The old Sammy's back!

442
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,407
Oh!

443
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,407
I can't believe it!

444
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,245
Excuse me, miss, have you seen
a, an Olympic gold medal

445
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,081
from the decathlon?

446
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,265
I hate to lose it.

447
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,334
It was part of a set.

448
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:48,652
But I'll tell you something,

449
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,706
I would give them all up
for a shot at your phone number.

450
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,025
Look, I find you very amusing

451
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,628
and, uh, I appreciate
all this flattery,

452
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:00,547
but if this is just some bar
pick-up, I wish you wouldn't.

453
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:02,933
I'm just coming off
a bad relationship

454
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,552
and I'm very vulnerable
right now.

455
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:08,772
Oh, well, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

456
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:12,926
Uh, actually, I'm, I'm
not an Olympic athlete.

457
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,696
(softly):
Sam, hurry!

458
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,999
Uh, I'm a secret agent.

459
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,701
Uh... I'm sorry.

460
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,336
You were right the first time.

461
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:24,604
It's a sleazy bar pick-up.

462
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,073
Yeah.
Forgive me.

463
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,076
It was very childish.

464
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,410
Good luck to you.

465
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:31,879
Thanks.
Yeah. Sorry.

466
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:34,131
(clock rings)

467
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,916
Aw, shoot.

468
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,284
I guess Henri wins.

469
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:39,920
I win! I win!

470
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,673
France has won!
France has won!

471
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,608
There's something
you never hear.

472
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,431
Well, Henri, you won
fair and square.

473
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:52,683
Congratulations.

474
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:55,768
Yes, I did, Sam,
and on behalf of Frenchmen everywhere,

475
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:57,904
let me just say...
(blows raspberry)

476
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,106
(laughs)

477
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,209
Well, thank you.
How very gracious of you.

478
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:05,112
Shame on you, Sam.
Shame on you!

479
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:06,779
You threw back the tying babe

480
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:09,616
just because she
was vulnerable.

481
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:12,619
The old Sammy would have kept on
pushing till he got the number.

482
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,871
Well, maybe I'm just
not the old Sammy anymore.

483
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:16,173
No, I guess you're not.

484
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,591
Uh, excuse me.

485
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,758
Yeah?

486
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:21,011
Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that

487
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:22,712
I, uh, appreciate you being
such a gentleman back there.

488
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:23,747
Oh, well...

489
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,266
You know, I don't meet
many men who are like that.

490
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,967
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

491
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:30,770
Good luck to you.

492
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,839
Hey, what are you doing
later on tonight?

493
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,610
Uh, I thought you wanted
to be alone.

494
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:38,311
What about all that
vulnerable stuff?

495
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:40,147
Oh, that was just a line I use

496
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,516
to find out
what kind of man I'm dealing with.

497
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,153
(laughs) Good for you!

498
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:47,820
Hey, you guys, you
have to meet this guy.

499
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,222
He is such a gentleman.

500
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:50,657
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

501
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,225
Oh, yeah, and he's cute too.

502
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,494
Oh.

503
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:54,795
Listen, we're gonna go out.

504
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,246
Do you want to come along?

505
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,415
It's a lot more fun with four.

506
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,083
Yeah.

507
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,202
Look, there's one thing
that you should know.

508
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:06,223
We do everything together.

509
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:07,891
Everything?

510
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,178
Everything.

511
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,046
Yeah.
Well!

512
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,115
Ladies, ladies.

513
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:19,436
Uh, Carla, uh, would you close
the bar for me?

514
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,356
Uh, oh, Henri, uh,
congratulations on that, uh,

515
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,658
that, uh, phone number
thing we were doing.

516
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,360
Okay, ladies,

517
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:30,247
right foot!
(laughs)

518
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,201
ALL:
USA! USA!

519
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:35,935
USA!
