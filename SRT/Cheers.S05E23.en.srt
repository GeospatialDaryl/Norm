1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,271
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:09,943
You missing something, Woody?

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,446
Yeah, well, I had a $20 bill
in my pocket and now it's gone.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,782
Well, say good-bye
to that Andy Jackson.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,536
Oh, see you later, Andy.

6
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:21,421
CLIFF: Boy, oh, boy.

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,423
Talk about your lucky days, huh?

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,925
Just found 20 smackers
back there in the pool room.

9
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,427
Yeah, and to celebrate my good fortune,

10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,296
I'm gonna buy a round of
drinks for all my, uh, friends.

11
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,799
What are you gonna do
with the other 19 bucks?

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,302
Woody, that could be your $20 bill.

13
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,303
The one you lost.

14
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,306
Hey, yeah, you know, I was
in the pool room earlier.

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,307
Wait a second.

16
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,692
Now let's be fair about this.

17
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:44,310
Uh, give me the serial number.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,445
Oh, come on, man.

19
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,814
Nobody knows serial numbers.

20
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:52,318
L-2-1-8-8-6-1-1-9-B

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,241
That's amazing.

22
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:01,127
How'd you do that?

23
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,130
Oh, I memorize the serial
numbers on all my currency.

24
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,998
Why?

25
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,383
For just such an occasion.

26
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,721
Tell you, though, I pray
everyday I don't get rich.

27

Hmm?

44
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,168
Sweetheart, we're
going to have to decide

45
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,170
where we're going for our honeymoon.

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,672
Where do you want to go?

47
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:36,673
Boy, I don't know.

48
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:38,675
Where, where, where do you want to go?

49
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,678
I told you where I
want to go-- Tibet.

50
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:42,679
Well, it's our honeymoon.

51
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,564
Of course we're going to bed.

52
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,900
No, you whammo.

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,902
Tibet the country.

54
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,270
Thank you. Thank you very much.

55
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,490
Sam, imagine getting up in the morning

56
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,993
and looking out on
the roof of the world.

57
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,495
Look where we'd stay. Isn't it quaint?

58
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,865
Looks like where the dogs sleep. It is.

59
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,249
The dogs sleep with us.

60
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,252
You wouldn't want to
freeze to death, would you?

61
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,754
Diane,

62
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,756
I didn't sleep with
dogs when I was single.

63
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,757
I'm not about to start now.

64
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,678
For goodness sake,
don't you want to taste

65
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,681
the exciting and fascinating
things that life has to offer?

66
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,682
No.

67
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,684
I'd rather marry you.

68
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:25,688
Afternoon, everybody.

69
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,190
ALL: Norm!

70
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,442
Hey, Mr. Peterson, what
do you say to a cold one?

71
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,194
"See ya later, Vera, I'll be at Cheers."

72
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,697
You're looking unusually chipper today.

73
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,199
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of chipper, Fras.

74
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,700
Is there any particular reason,

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,702
other than the fact that
we live in a democracy

76
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:42,205
and sushi bars appear
to be on the decline?

77
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:42,956
Well, I was gonna

78
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,791
tell Vera first, but
why break tradition?

79
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,793
I just landed a great new job

80
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,161
at Masters and Holly and Dixon.

81
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,079
Oh, wonderful!

82
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,548
It's one of the top
C.P.A. firms in Boston.

83
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,050
Yes, I hear that's
quite a successful firm.

84
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,052
You know, over half of their executives

85
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,053
require therapy on a regular basis.

86
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:58,554
So, uh, here's my card.

87
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,056
Oh, great. Just in case.

88
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,057
Thank you.

89
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,558
It's a very impressive place.

90
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:04,060
Uh, they occupy the entire 25th floor

91
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,561
of the Boston Towers.

92
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,562
And they hired you?

93
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,064
It must have been the altitude.

94
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,066
No, no, no, no,
seriously, Norm, I'm sorry.

95
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:13,069
You know, I hope this
works out to be, you know,

96
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,570
sort of a long-term
arrangement for you.

97
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,572
Long enough anyway for them to see you

98
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,274
wear your other suit.

99
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,610
NORM: Very funny. Very funny, you guys.

100
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,611
But I'll have you know they

101
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,112
gave me the key to the executive

102
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:23,997
washroom this morning.

103
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,782
Did it come with a bucket and mop?

104
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,784
Laugh all you want, okay,

105
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,286
but I think this is
finally the job for me.

106
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,255
I've got a secretary.

107
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:33,122
I have an expense account,

108
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:34,841
a very ritzy office

109
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,125
all to myself, so...

110
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,627
Good for you, Norman.

111
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,129
How about a round of applause
for our new executive?

112
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,514
(middling applause)

113
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,969
Well, I started late.

114
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,470
I didn't want to be impolite.

115
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,725
I'm really excited for
you, Norman. Thanks.

116
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,527
I can tell by the way you're talking

117
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,030
that this is the job that's
going to fire your enthusiasm.

118
00:04:58,147 --> 00:04:59,449
When do you start?

119
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:00,950
About, uh, three hours ago.

120
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,872
What are you doing here?

121
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,874
I didn't want to appear
over-anxious, you know.

122
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,127
Yeah, no danger there, huh, Buddy?

123
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:12,962
No, no, I'm on my lunch hour.

124
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:13,963
DIANE: Oh.

125
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,466
But, you know, I could
be late if I wanted to.

126
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:18,468
I mean, I got free rein over there.

127
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:19,969
I happen to be my own boss.

128
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,471
So that's how you got the job.

129
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,474
Thanks for the send-off, guys.

130
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,930
Well, I hope you're
all proud of yourselves.

131
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,432
SAM: Why?

132
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:32,932
What'd we do?

133
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,934
Well, I think we could have been

134
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,937
a bit more thunderous in our applause.

135
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,439
(clears throat)

136
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,442
Uh, except for Woody.

137
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,445
Sam, didn't you see the
hurt in Norman's eyes?

138
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,448
He was seeking our support and approval.

139
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,949
It's his first day on the job

140
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,452
and all we did was give him jibes.

141
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,870
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

142
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,373
He's had hundreds of
first days on the job.

143
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:00,126
You know, Diane's right.

144
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,427
It's obvious how much we mean to him.

145
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,795
I think we may have let him down.

146
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,597
Oh... Gee, I hope not.

147
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,015
Yeah, me, too.

148
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,017
Oh, too late to do
anything about that now.

149
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,886
Refill, huh, Sam?

150
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:13,639
Hey, it's not too late.

151
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,392
We could march en masse

152
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:19,062
down to Norman's office and show
him that we're in his corner.

153
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,363
Oh, sure.

154
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,365
Perhaps buy the new hotshot
a little office warming gift.

155
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,366
Maybe a potted plant.

156
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,233
Good!

157
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,151
Okay, hurry up.

158
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,152
Let's get going here.

159
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,120
Wonderful, Carla.

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,621
That's the kind of enthusiasm

161
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,123
that's going to make Norman feel better.

162
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,574
The hell with that yutz.

163
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:32,575
I wanna go downtown and see

164
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,962
some Yuppie buns in tight Italian suits.

165
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,830
Well, then it's settled.

166
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,715
We'll go.

167
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,134
Wish I could join you,

168
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,136
but I've got an appointment at 1:00.

169
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,137
Oh, what the hell?

170
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,139
Mrs. Segal's rather
a compulsive cleaner.

171
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,641
If I'm a little late, maybe
she'll tidy up the office.

172
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,094
Give my best to Norm.

173
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,595
Well, aren't you coming?

174
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,597
Oh, I gotta take care of the bar here.

175
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:58,101
Oh, Sam, we've got to show Norman

176
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,603
our impressive phalanx.

177
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,604
Oh, that's all right, honey.

178
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:03,106
He saw mine at the gym.

179
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,781
CLIFF: And then there
was this 1938 accident

180
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,283
where the elevator plunged 86 floors.

181
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,285
Get me out of this thing!

182
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,287
Oh, my.

183
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,791
What an exquisite place
to come to work everyday.

184
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,794
Have you ever seen such
sumptuous surroundings?

185
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,296
Well, you obviously
haven't been to the, uh,

186
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:28,798
new downtown postal annex, Diane.

187
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:32,301
So, uh, where's Woody?

188
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,302
I hope he's not lost.

189
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,304
Gee, what are the odds?

190
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:38,307
2511. Here we are.

191
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,308
(gasps)

192
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:42,562
Damn. Got another one
of those carpet shocks.

193
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,397
Well, Carla, if you'd walk like a lady,

194
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,398
that wouldn't happen.

195
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,234
If I walked like a lady,
nothing would happen.

196
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,457
Sorry I'm late.

197
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,459
Ah, Woody, uh,

198
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,461
couldn't you find a bigger one?

199
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,962
No.

200
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,964
You know,

201
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,966
at the risk of sounding
self-congratulatory,

202
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,468
I think we're fabulous.

203
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,669
Just think

204
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,555
how Norman will appreciate this.

205
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,474
You know, I remember the first day

206
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,343
I worked at The Third Eye Bookstore.

207
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:17,180
Ramu was explaining to me
the difference between...

208
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,016
I think it was between
psychic and occult.

209
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,017
Ouch!

210
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,856
Think we could get
this carpet for the bar?

211
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,358
All right. Everyone ready?

212
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,862
ALL: Surprise!

213
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,868
Don't you guys ever think
about maybe calling first?

214
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,836
Yeah, well, we couldn't
find a phone booth.

215
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,838
Until now.

216
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,343
Say, did anybody ever see Das Boot?

217
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,680
What're you guys doing here?

218
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,598
Well, we wanted to come down

219
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,601
and celebrate your
first day on the new job.

220
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,470
WOODY: Yeah, we brought you a gift.

221
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,889
Uh, let me find the
perfect spot for this.

222
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:07,396
There.

223
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,398
Don't forget to water it.

224
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:14,403
Thanks, I'll write myself a note, Woody.

225
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:17,406
So, guys, I, uh...

226
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,910
guess I probably exaggerated
a little bit about the office.

227
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,378
(chuckling )

228
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,297
But, uh, you know, it's just 'cause

229
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,548
you were razzing me so much,

230
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,832
and it's actually quite

231
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,334
a big step to have an office at all.

232
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,720
I mean, many people in this
firm have to share an office.

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,587
(knocking)

234
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:34,090
Oh, just a sec. Sorry.

235
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,091
Yeah?

236
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,093
Just, uh, set it right
here, that's fine.

237
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,097
Let me guess.

238
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:41,981
Peterson.

239
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,898
Right.

240
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm Thompkins.

241
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,402
Looks like we're office partners.

242
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,961
So...

243
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,246
if you're lookin' for a
secretary, I'm available.

244
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,749
But I want you to know
I do not take shorthand,

245
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,751
I don't type and I don't make coffee.

246
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,253
Well, what do you do?

247
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,756
Hire me and find out.

248
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:10,259
Carla, I don't think he caught that.

249
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,262
Next time try to be more obvious.

250
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,265
Okay, let's let Norman get back to work.

251
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,767
Thanks.

252
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,652
Oh, Norman, keep up the spirits, huh?

253
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,022
Remember-- no small
offices, only small people.

254
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,939
That's right, right.

255
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,825
Okay... oh, my God, look at the time.

256
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,193
If I don't get back right now,

257
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,577
Mrs. Segal will be shampooing the rug.

258
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:29,528
Well, okay.

259
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,530
Thanks, thanks a lot for the plant.

260
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,532
Wait, wait, my supervisor.

261
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,533
Everybody hide.

262
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,536
Peterson.

263
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,537
Hi, sir.

264
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,539
What are all these people doing in here?

265
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,291
Well, they're new clients, sir, and, uh,

266
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,126
we were just holding a little impromptu

267
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:46,128
seminar on the tax laws, and, uh...

268
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,631
So in conclusion, folks,
I'd like you to, uh,

269
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,100
file early and, um... file out.

270
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,101
Right, fine.

271
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,602
Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

272
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,106
Thank you. New clients, sir, so...

273
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,607
You're, uh, you're
Thompkins, aren't you?

274
00:10:58,607 --> 00:10:59,608
Yes, sir.

275
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:00,609
Yes, well, welcome aboard.

276
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:01,610
Pay attention.

277
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,612
You can learn a lot from this man.

278
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,114
Thank you, sir. That's
very kind of you to say.

279
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,616
No, I was talking to you.

280
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:11,620
By the way, sir, I understand
you're a big Red Sox fan.

281
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,621
Yeah.

282
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,073
You know, my father has season tickets,

283
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,574
uh, right behind the dugout. No kidding?

284
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,876
Yeah, you know, I'm, I'm usually so busy

285
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,245
with work here, I, I
rarely get to use them.

286
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,247
Thompkins, let's have lunch.

287
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,215
THOMPKINS: Thank you.

288
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,216
Oh, that's a, wait.

289
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,218
That's a, uh, lovely tie
you've got there, sir.

290
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,720
What, this ugly thing?

291
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,471
Yeah.

292
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,755
Oh, my wife bought it.

293
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,639
Yeah, how is the missus?

294
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,974
We're divorcing.

295
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,476
Well, I hope you stick it to her, sir.

296
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,735
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

297
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,103
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm great.

298
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,488
Top of the world, ma!

299
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,527
Hey, the first day at a
new job is always traumatic.

300
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,828
Look at me.

301
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:55,197
I'm pushing 40, practically
starting over again.

302
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:56,866
Oh, Norman, that's not true.

303
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,250
Yes, it is.

304
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,502
Yeah?

305
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,287
Yeah, I'm delivering
supplies to the supply room.

306
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,671
This isn't the supply room. Sorry.

307
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,090
Well, it's 2511, right?

308
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,457
Right.

309
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,841
Then it's the supply room.

310
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,042
Well, it may have been

311
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,928
the supply room once, okay,
but now it's my office.

312
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,212
What does it say on this invoice?

313
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:11,046
2511.

314
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:11,764
Thank you.

315
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,051
See what I mean, Diane?

316
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,554
I just wasn't meant to be a success.

317
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,056
Norman, may I speak to you for a moment?

318
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,112
You make me sick.

319
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:28,864
You're a quitter, Norman.

320
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,366
No, you're worse than that.

321
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,867
You're a non-starter.

322
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,869
You don't even try.

323
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,287
You sit around the bar all day.

324
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,789
You sit around your house all day.

325
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,290
You sit around here all day.

326
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,291
You sit around life all day.

327
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,993
How are you gonna feel some day

328
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,462
at the end of your
life when you're lying,

329
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,966
no, make that sitting, on your deathbed

330
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,834
and you realize

331
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,670
that the only thing you've
done in your life is sit around

332
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,639
and watch people do things,

333
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,841
make things out of their lives.

334
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,676
Well, maybe you're right, Norman.

335
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,680
Maybe you're not meant for success.

336
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,183
Maybe you're meant for
exactly what you are.

337
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,185
Nothing.

338
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,737
Diane, you have no
right to say that to me.

339
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:18,447
Norman, I said those things
to you because I care.

340
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:22,418
You must care an awful lot about me.

341
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:26,672
Well, I do.

342
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,925
All of your friends care
about you an awful lot.

343
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,429
And we're tired of seeing
you give up so easily.

344
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,936
Maybe I won't give up
so easily this time.

345
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,556
Maybe those harsh, stinging,

346
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,557
offensive words of yours,

347
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,026
words that I'll take to
my grave, by the way...

348
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,529
maybe they finally struck
a cord with me, Diane.

349
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,231
Oh, Norman, do you mean it?

350
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,066
Oh, yes, I do, Diane.

351
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,568
You know, every place I've worked,

352
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,070
my name has been synonymous with patsy.

353
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,789
Well, I think it's high time
my name stood for ruthless.

354
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,491
Now people may not like the new me,

355
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,159
but they're gonna respect the new me.

356
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,046
Diane, I want you to mark
this date on your calendar,

357
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,047
for today is the day

358
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,798
the new me is born.

359
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:10,966
Happy birthday.

360
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,801
Sign here. Uh-uh.

361
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,503
I'm gonna tell the boss.

362
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,474
No, no, Norman, Norman, Norman...

363
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,427
Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.

364
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,901
Well, it's a start.

365
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,902
Yeah.

366
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,608
You know, I was thinking
while you were gone,

367
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,992
it's not really fair to have you

368
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,944
make all the honeymoon plans,

369
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,946
so I went ahead and I did them myself.

370
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,448
All you have to do

371
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,201
is pack your bags and
set your dial for fun.

372
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:49,455
Oh, God, it's Niagara Falls, isn't it?

373
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,590
No, it's not Niagara Falls.

374
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,292
That place is a tourist trap.

375
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,211
You ready for this?

376
00:14:56,211 --> 00:15:00,215
Disneyworld.

377
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:03,719
You want to go to
Disneyworld for our honeymoon?

378
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,720
Oh, yeah.

379
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,721
But, Sam, I always thought

380
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:08,724
that would be someplace
we'd go when we have kids.

381
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:09,725
Well, hey, no,

382
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:10,726
this is not just for kids.

383
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:14,730
This, this is for
"children of all ages."

384
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,733
I mean, can you say the
same thing about Tibet?

385
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:21,236
Well, how can you compare
Disneyworld and Tibet...

386
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,738
where we might possibly

387
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,240
unravel the mysteries of life?

388
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,242
Well, there, there are lots of mysteries

389
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,244
you can unravel at Disneyworld.

390
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:31,747
For example?

391
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:34,249
Um, all right, all right,

392
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,251
uh, why is it that, uh, Donald Duck

393
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,754
wears a top and no
bottom, whereas Mickey

394
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,756
wears a bottom and no top?

395
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,594
Oh, Sammy, it-it's
because, you know, uh,

396
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,596
a duck's private's are
hidden by their feathers

397
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:52,351
and mouse's is, uh,
well, need I say more?

398
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,687
While you're at it, I mean, why is it

399
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,488
we've never seen Donald fly?

400
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,491
I mean, I've seen that
damn duck do The Carioca.

401
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,493
Yeah, and if Mickey's dating Minnie,

402
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,495
how come he has such a high voice?

403
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,863
Oh, now, whoa, wait, are you trying

404
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,332
to tell me that Mickey...

405
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,834
All right, all right, all
right, we'll go! We'll go!

406
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,336
Evening, everybody.

407
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,337
ALL: Norm!

408
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,338
DIANE: Norman.

409
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,839
SAM: Well, look at you.

410
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,841
You look like the cat
that swallowed the canary.

411
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,843
Give me a beer to wash him down.

412
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,346
Hey, you're, uh, you're in
kinda late there, me bucko.

413
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,347
So how was your first day?

414
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,849
Well, I tell you, I
feel a lot better now

415
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,850
than I did this morning.

416
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,719
Diane, I took your advice

417
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,722
and I spent the afternoon
jotting down some ideas

418
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,224
I think'll save the
company a lot of money.

419
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,609
Oh, Norman!

420
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:35,110
That's wonderful!

421
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,612
I'm gonna pitch it to
my supervisor tomorrow.

422
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:38,614
But, I tell you, I'm a little nervous

423
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:40,115
about putting my butt on the line.

424
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,117
How do you think the line feels?

425
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,121
Norman...

426
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:48,574
why waste time with the supervisor?

427
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,076
He'll only take credit
for the idea himself.

428
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,078
Why don't you go right to the top?

429
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,330
Present your idea to
the Board of Directors.

430
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,166
I don't know, the
thought of standing there

431
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,169
in a room full of bigwigs
just gives me the cold sweats.

432
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,171
Boy, yeah, I can sympathize
with you there, Normie.

433
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,672
Yeah?

434
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:05,057
Yeah, I'll never forget
my first oral report.

435
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,476
Sixth grade. Yeah?

436
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:08,977
Yeah, boy, was I nervous. I tell you.

437
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:12,481
I went to my father and
he said, "Hey, just relax.

438
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,483
"You'll be fine as long as you can

439
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,485
imagine the other kids
in their underwear."

440
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:17,986
Which was no big deal for me

441
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,856
because I'd gotten that far with
half the girls in class already.

442
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:22,858
Even then, huh?

443
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,861
Yeah, anyway, I was, uh, just describing

444
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:28,864
how they make maple syrup by
draining the sap from trees

445
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,366
when I happened to look
down and notice how nicely

446
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,368
Cindy Van Rippen had filled out.

447
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,369
Ooh. Oh, yes. Ha-ha.

448
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,371
Well, what happened next?

449
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:39,374
Oh, well, I, uh, I smiled
at her and she smiled at me

450
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:41,376
and then after my little speech

451
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:44,263
we stole a few moments in the cloakroom.

452
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:48,100
No, I mean after they drain
the sap from the trees.

453
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,473
I don't remember, Woody.

454
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,474
Oh, great, Sam.

455
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,977
Get us all revved up and
then leave out the best part.

456
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,982
Norman, nothing takes the
place of personal support.

457
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,985
Therefore, when you're
ready to make your proposal,

458
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,488
I will be at your side.

459
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,956
Tell them that you've hired a personal

460
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,825
secretary to assist
you, at your expense.

461
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,326
Diane, please, I mean,

462
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,828
you've been more than
helpful already, okay?

463
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,830
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

464
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,331
I just need a little practice.

465
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,332
CLIFF: Well, uh, Normie,

466
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,835
well, why don't you, uh,
try it out on us, huh?

467
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,836
That's a good idea actually.

468
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,337
Oh, yes, it is good. Good, good.

469
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,339
Stand up here so we can all see you.

470
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,340
All right.

471
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,341
Uh, now remember, guys,

472
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,843
uh, this room'll be a pressure cooker,

473
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,345
so just, uh, you know,
stay on top of me, okay?

474
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,596
Really heckle me.

475
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,398
It'll help.

476
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,400
(clears throat)

477
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,269
Good morning, gentlemen.

478
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,688
Uh, what's good about it?

479
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,161
What time can you be there?

480
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,785
...enjoy a 58% growth.

481
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:57,786
Cash flow.

482
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,288
And we'll achieve it no later...

483
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,289
Thank God.

484
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,790
Thank God you're here.

485
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,292
Norman, don't worry, please.

486
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,793
Everything is going to be perfect.

487
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:06,295
I hope so.

488
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,297
I'm, uh, having a very tough time

489
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,799
picturing the chairman of
the board in his underpants.

490
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,800
Oh, no.

491
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,302
What? Now what? What?

492
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,305
Oh, Pierre forgot the
chocolate croissant I ordered.

493
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,806
Don't worry about it.
It wasn't that good.

494
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,311
That's a nice suit, Peterson.

495
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:23,812
They make it in your size?

496
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,317
Pay no attention to him.

497
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:33,205
Norman is making a proposal
today at the board meeting.

498
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,706
Well, he's wasting his time.

499
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,959
Those stuffed shirts don't
care about anybody's ideas.

500
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,795
Why don't you just have the
courage to wish him well?

501
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,463
Why don't you take a flying leap?

502
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,132
Touche.

503
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:49,087
Now listen, I don't
like to make predictions,

504
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,089
but you're going to be

505
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,091
in the top echelon of
this company someday.

506
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,593
Your idea is so good

507
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,511
they can't help but applaud it.

508
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:57,512
I hope you're right, Diane,

509
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,514
but, uh, we have a few minutes now

510
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,767
and I just, I wanna splash
some water on my face.

511
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,602
Fine, fine, I'll go prepare the coffee.

512
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,486
Okay.

513
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,355
It's a special Viennese blend.

514
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,856
They're bound to be impressed.

515
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:08,857
Oh, great, great.

516
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,859
For my part I think I'd like to get

517
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,861
a second opinion on this pastry,

518
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:14,363
you know what I mean?

519
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:29,127
(whistling)

520
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,529
Diane!

521
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,314
It's-It's gone!

522
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,816
What's gone?

523
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,818
Well, my proposal and my career.

524
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,819
The pastry!

525
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh, no.

526
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,822
THOMPKINS: If my plan is
implemented immediately,

527
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,323
we'll enjoy a 58%

528
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,708
growth in cash flow.

529
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,493
And we'll achieve it no later than

530
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,995
the third quarter of
the next fiscal year.

531
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:03,996
Thompkins. The thief.

532
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,497
Get in there and defend yourself.

533
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,999
Damn right I will.

534
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,000
MAN: Thompkins, you idiot!

535
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,885
You've completely ignored the obvious.

536
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,804
Our resulting tax liability
would cost us a fortune.

537
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,806
THOMPKINS: Uh, actually,
sir, it's not my plan.

538
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,308
It's the new guy, Peterson's, you see...

539
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,810
MAN: Don't try blaming
another man for this garbage.

540
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,313
Now stop wasting our
time and get back to work.

541
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,319
Just my luck.

542
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,322
I had to share the office with a moron.

543
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,491
Hey, sorry.

544
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,326
MAN: I'll give him this, though.

545
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,328
The man knows his pastry.

546
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,836
Oh, geez.

547
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,838
Now, Norman. Please.

548
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,840
Now don't let this faze you.

549
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,292
You have to keep pushing.

550
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:53,462
I know that this idea didn't succeed,

551
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:54,463
but others will.

552
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,464
No, no, Diane.

553
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:56,965
A few moments ago I almost made

554
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:58,967
the biggest mistake of my
professional life, okay?

555
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,852
And it was because I was doing something

556
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,604
that just wasn't me.

557
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,555
I am not a go-getter.

558
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,057
I've never been a go-getter.

559
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,059
And what's more, I don't
even want to be a go-getter.

560
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,895
I'm very happy right where I am.

561
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,863
And I'm tired of all
these people saying,

562
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,115
"Peterson, you've gotta push.

563
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:13,899
"You gotta get ahead.

564
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,400
You gotta make that goal."

565
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,902
I don't even wanna make the goal, Diane.

566
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,403
I wanna be a bench warmer, okay?

567
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,405
The world needs bench warmers.

568
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:23,408
I mean, if there were no bench
warmers, what would we have?

569
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,912
We'd have cold benches.
A lot of cold benches.

570
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,164
And the world does not need that, Diane.

571
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,999
In this great pageantry of life,

572
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:34,002
Norm Peterson may be
a, a motionless lump,

573
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:35,387
but he's a very damn good one.

574
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,557
Norman, I've never
seen you so impassioned.

575
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,675
That's 'cause I believe in this, Diane.

576
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:41,843
Look, Norm Peterson

577
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:44,262
is totally happy being an anonymous cog

578
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,149
in the gigantic machinery of this firm.

579
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,433
Oh, I forgot.

580
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,435
Didn't you wanna say
something at the meeting?

581
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,322
Just how delighted I was
to be part of the firm, sir.

582
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,775
Well, we're glad to have
you aboard, Springsteen.

583
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,165
I'm home.
