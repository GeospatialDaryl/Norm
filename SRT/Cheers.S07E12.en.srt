2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:07,505
Excuse me, can I have           
your attention please?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,442
It is my pleasure,              
once again,

4
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:13,311
to present the Cheers Employee  
of the Month Award.

5
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:16,414
And I am delighted to present it
  to our very own, Sam Malone.

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:17,349
Congratulations.    
Bravo!

7
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

8
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,219
I told you before   
        I don't want that thing.

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,721
And don't put my picture    
    on the wall, either.

10
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:23,755
I hate that stuff.

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,057
Oh, great speech, Sammy.

12
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,108
Fine.

13
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:29,310
Carla, you haven't been
          offensive this month,

14
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:29,978
why don't you take it?

15
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:32,013
Get that thing                  
away from me.

16
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:34,215
Woody?

17
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,417
Congratulations, you're     
the Employee of the Month.

18
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:41,673
Wow, four months in a row!

19
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:44,476
I wasn't really expecting       
    this great honor.

20
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,910
I'm deeply moved.

21
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:49,097
You know, it takes more than one
person to win this award.

22
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,966
It takes teamwork.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,533
I would like to thank my...

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,315
¶ Sure would help a lot

¶ Wouldn't you like       
         to get away? ¶

30
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,640
¶ Sometimes you want to go

¶ Where everybody knows     
          your name ¶

32
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,617
¶ And they're always

00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,224
Hey, you know, same to ya!

41
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,143
That's it, I've had it.

42
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,646
I'm finished.

43
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,398
I've been embarrassed   
            for the last time.  
                        What?

44
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,365
I just came on                  
to Rebecca

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,384
for the I-don't-know-           
how-manyth time.

46
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,920
4,659.

47
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,722
Thank you, Carla.

48
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,974
And she shot me down once again.

49
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:24,742
Well, you know, that's it.

50
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,143
That's the last time            
I'm gonna do that.

51
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:29,714
I'm gonna get my self respect  
    back starting right now.

52
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:33,367
Whoo!              
Feels damn good, I'll tell you.

53
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,037
You know, Sam, 
                 there's one way

54
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,538
to get Rebecca that
             you've overlooked.

55
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:39,574
Hold that self-respect thought.

56
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,742
What do you got?

57
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,710
You see, it's been
      psychologically documented

58
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:47,515
that all human animals have
a neurotic hair-trigger response

59
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,852
to at least one
    of the five sensory stimuli.

60
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,954
It could be
             anything, actually.

61
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:56,190
Oh, it's the sound of   
            the surf pounding   
              against the shore,

62
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:59,961
the smell of honeysuckle
        on a warm summer night,

63
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:02,797
the taste of a vintage
        Chateauneuf du Pape,

64
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:08,586
fire-red fingernails dancing
     through your chest hair...

65
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:16,927
a black lace teddy straining
     against its fleshy cargo.

66
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:19,613
Frasier, man,                   
snap out of it.

67
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,115
In a minute, Sam.

68
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:28,789
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

69
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:29,958
Some mornings

70
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,676
you get up, you look at yourself
in the mirror

71
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,577
and you've got to ask, "Why me?"

72
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:34,879
Cliffie, it's just a haircut.

73
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,181
It'll grow back.

74
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,317
Nah, I'm over that, Normie.

75
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,985
I got saddled with a job

76
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,721
of breaking in         
     a new postal employee.

77
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,122
Yeah, so I told the supervisor

78
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:47,925
to send the greenhorn down here 
    and I could size him up.

79
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,760
Boy, they made you              
a trainer, huh?

80
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:52,730
Well, that sounds like a
        compliment to me, Cliff.

81
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:56,117
You really are a civilian,      
aren't you, Sammy?

82
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,785
It's a nightmare.

83
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,620
Those rookies, yeah,            
they just get in your way,

84
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,956
ask you stupid questions,       
  throw off your whole rhythm.

85
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,542
Oh, God, this won't slow down  
    the mail, will it?

86
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,331
Uh-oh, Cliff, greenhorn alert.

87
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,233
Excuse me, Cliff Clavin?

88
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:13,468
I am.

89
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,870
I'm your trainee,               
Margaret O'Keefe.

90
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,939
Straighten up, O'Keefe.
              You're in uniform.

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,949
I wasn't informed               
you were a woman.

92
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,818
Sorry, sir.

93
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,519
Well, no offense, sister,

94
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,822
but I just don't believe        
that women belong               
in the trenches.

95
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,957
I mean, they're fine            
for sorting mail                
or selling stamps,

96
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:38,460
but when you're lugging         
a 40-pound sack

97
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,694
up a hill with a Nor'easter

98
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,429
hitting you right smack         
in the kisser,

99
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,364
you don't have time             
to fret about going home

100
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:45,567
and soaking your delicates.

101
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,036
I wear cotton   
                briefs, sir.

102
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,705
That'll be enough of that,      
O'Keefe.

103
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:55,109
Permission                      
to speak freely, sir?

104
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:58,446
Permission granted.

105
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,981
I requested you                 
as my trainer

106
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,649
because I want                  
to learn hard

107
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,317
and I want to learn right.

108
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:04,802
I want to be            
        the best carrier

109
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,571
in the department,              
next to you, of course.

110
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:08,839
Because I love                  
the post office

111
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:11,042
more than my life itself.

112
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:14,762
Good grief, there's another one.

113
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,914
The post office                 
is in my blood;

114
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:20,451
my father was a carrier,        
and his father before him.

115
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,719
It's been                       
a life-long dream of mine

116
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,053
to wear the eagle               
on my sleeve

117
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:26,023
and to be a part                
of the few, the proud...

118
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,192
The undateable.

119
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:32,196
Oh, your attitude

120
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,598
is commendable 
                 there, O'Keefe.

121
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:37,067
Look, I think   
                you better mosey
                     on home now

122
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,802
and grab                        
some shuteye.

123
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:41,939
You're going          
    to need plenty of sleep.

124
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:44,775
Tomorrow is <i>TV Guide</i> day.

125
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,679
I'll do you proud, sir.

126
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,748
Yeah, we'll see about that.

127
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,388
Is it my imagination, or was  
  that woman coming on to me?

128
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,093
Cliffie, Walt Disney    
        should have had your    
            imagination.

129
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,363
Say, hi, honey.

130
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:07,164
Um, Fras and I                  
were just talking

131
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,667
about how sorry                 
we feel about you.

132
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,168
Why is that, Sam?

133
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,705
Well, it's just that            
you're always stuck             
in your office,

134
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,407
you know, worrying about losses 
and profits and career moves,

135
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,542
while we're out here

136
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,210
having fascinating,

137
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,394
fun-filled conversations

138
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:26,500
about things like, well,        
like sexual stimuluses.

139
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:31,205
By the way, do you have,        
do you have one of those?

140
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,311
Well, I am driven 
              to a sexual frenzy

141
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,512
by people who mind 
             their own business.

142
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,416
No, no, really, listen.

143
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,850
You know,   
         it's not like I'm going

144
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,552
to do anything with it
                    or anything.

145
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:45,853
Okay, I'll be honest            
with you.

146
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:49,090
I do have one                   
and I'll give you a hint.

147
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:50,491
A hint?
                     Great, why?

148
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,126
Because                         
you'll never get it.

149
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,762
And I mean that                 
in every sense                  
of the word.

150
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,464
It's a song.

151
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,699
That's it?                      
It's a song?

152
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,967
Mm-hmm.

153
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,004
One little tiny song
            that turned my knees
                    to butter

154
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,306
when I was a teenager   
                 and still does.

155
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,007
Good luck, Sam.

156

158
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:11,345
This is great; a song.

159
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,146
Man, you were right, Frasier.

160
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,331
Thank you.

161
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:14,898
Wow, what luck, huh?

162
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,034
I mean, how many songs     
         can there be?

163
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,931
I've been going                 
over the books, Norm,

164
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,466
and I think it's time           
to pay your tab.

165
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,852
Oh, gee, thanks, Rebecca.

166
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,355
I mean, it's time for <i>you</i>       
<i>to pay your tab.</i>

167

Right, Sam, 
                I was insane.

175
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,109
I'll find it.

176
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,978
Sam, why don't you try     
      "Che Gelida Manina"

177
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:02,763
from <i>La Boheme?</i>

178
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:06,284
It can be almost achingly       
poignant when executed correctly

179
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:09,853
and it does turn Lilith     
      into a cheap tramp.

180
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,223
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,

181
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:14,958
aren't you overlooking          
the obvious here?

182
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,327
Yeah? What's that?

183
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,195
"Ballad of The Green Berets."

184
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,634
Oh, that's a great song.

185
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,036
¶ Fighting soldiers       
        from the sky. ¶

186
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,740
Anybody who isn't totally moved 
          by that song

187
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,508
is somebody           
     I don't want to know.

188
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,677
Cliff, in honor
                  of that song,

189
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,779
why don't you put on    
        a little green beret,

190
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:38,315
go outside and sit
            on a land mine?

191
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,454
Oh, there you are, Cliff.

192
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:45,273
Ooh, it's Cliff now, eh?

193
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,574
Training must be going          
very well.

She's a natural.

195
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,010
I'm really sorry                
about today.

196
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:52,413
I can't believe I missed that   
entire apartment building.

197

Ah, the tradition               
continues.

198
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,970
Listen, Margaret,   
            why don't we sit    
                down over here

199
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,540
away from those who
    merely wait for the mail?

200
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,609
There you go.

201
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,877
Park it right there.

202
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,311
I just want to tell you, Cliff,

203
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:09,714
that I couldn't have made it   
 through training without you.

204
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,415
You'll be graduating      
          with honors.

205
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,384
Really?

206
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:15,386
Well, how could you not, with  
 the recommendation I gave you?

207
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,723
Oh, Cliff, thank you, thank you.

208
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:19,440
Thank you.

209
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,066
In honor of your achievement,  
             I, uh,

210
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,468
went out and got you
                  a little gift.

211
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:32,670
Thank you.

212
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,405
You really shouldn't have.

Yeah, yeah.

00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:41,079
I got you the large size, too.

216
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,648
I noticed you've got a pretty  
 hefty pair of dogs down there.

217
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,019
Cliff, you are so considerate.

218
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:53,190
What we've been through together
      has been so special.

219
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,041
Yeah.

220
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,877
I wish there was a way     
I could be closer to you.

221
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,397
Ah, scootch on over.

222
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,833
No, I didn't...                 
Oh, never mind.

223
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,134
This is so embarrassing.

224
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:05,469
I'm not good at this.           
I mean,

225
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,303
why would a man                 
like you

226
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:08,272
even consider                   
someone like me?

227
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,975
What? What in God's name are you
      trying to say here?

228
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,010
Cliff, do you find me           
attractive?

229
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,612
I mean, physically?

230
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:17,848
Cliff, do you want              
to be with me?

231
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:18,882
I want to be with you.

232
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,103
So it's a date.

233
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:24,889
I'll come over to your place    
tomorrow night.

234

My place?

235

No. hey, Margaret, Margaret,  
      whoa, hold on there.

236
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:31,796
Listen, uh, last month
              my mother came out
             and stayed a while,

237
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,430
and she got to know
        the neighbors real well,

238
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,598
and I don't want word   
            getting back to her

239
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,533
that her son            
        does bad things.

240
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,389
Then, uh, why don't we meet     
at that little motel

241

just outside Zone 27?

Tomorrow night                  
after work?

243
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,380
Yeah, I guess  
                I could make it.

Oh, no, Sam,                    
I'm just a little tired.

307
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,175
No, Woody, no.

308
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,409
That's Rebecca's song.

309
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:24,745
Hold the bar down here     
     for a minute, will ya?

310
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,947
I got to get something     
         out of my car.

311
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,882
Hey, Sammy.

312
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:32,870
Woody, a bottle of bubbly,
                  <i>tout de suite.</i>

313
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,572
All right, Cliffie's in
             a celebrating mood.

314
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,406
That hearing must have gone
            pretty well, huh?

315
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,041
Perfect, Norm.

316
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,844
Margaret was completely
                     exonerated.

317
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,011
You really snowed 'em, huh?

318
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,380
Like a blizzard in Buffalo,
                      my friend.

319
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,549
Yeah, I told the supervisor
        that we were set upon

320
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,018
by some armed thugs who then
    commandeered the vehicle

321
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,520
and took it for a joyride.

322
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,489
A joyride in a mail truck?

323
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,391
Cliffie, I've beaten those      
        things on foot.

324
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,294
Clavin, what's come over you?

325
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,646
I mean you're lying
             to your superiors,

326
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,649
you're breaking rules,
        you're covering up.

327
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:05,035
It's almost like you're     
developing a personality.

328
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:08,305
Well, Carla, the King of England
      abdicated his throne

329
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,073
for the love of a good woman.

330
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,243
The least I could do       
     is tell a little fib.

331
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,779
Well, as we say
        down at the post office,

332
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,414
here's looking up   
                your address.

333
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,887
Come on, Maggie,
                     bottoms up.

334
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:26,423
I can't, Cliff.

335
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,958
Why?

336
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:29,627
How can we celebrate?

337
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,128
We dishonored the uniform.

338
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,763
I don't feel worthy to wear it.

339
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,032
Yeah, I understand.

340
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,133
Look, uh...

341
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,335
why don't we go         
      back to that motel,

342
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,970
lie down and talk about it, huh?

343
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,873
No, Cliff.

344
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,708
Do you think I fell for you

345
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,278
because you're a handsome,      
sexy man?

346
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,782
I fell for you because          
you're handsome inside.

347
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:57,288
But now, even though I'm the one
that corrupted you,

348
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,006
you are corrupt.

349
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:04,161
We're both dirty inside.

350
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,597
Well, let's go back
                to the motel,

351
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:08,999
they cater to people like us.

352
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,404
No, I can't be
            with you anymore.

353
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,972
I don't feel what I
         felt before. I'm sorry.

354
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:20,077
Well, uh, is there any way      
we could, you know,

355
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:22,246
get that feeling back?

356
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,880
We can tell
                 them the truth.

357
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:25,115
Oh, no, Margaret.

358
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,185
See, if you tell them the truth,
they're gonna know that I lied.

359
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,553
Yes, but with your record,

360
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,155
the worst that will
                happen to us,

361
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:33,123
is that we'll get  
            a slap on the wrist,

362
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,025
and then we can get on
                 with our lives.

363
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,627
You know what's going           
to happen, don't ya?

364
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,364
What we did back at that motel

365
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,666
is going to become part         
of the postal record.

366
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,169
I can live with that.

367
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:47,971
Me, too.

368
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,308
Do you think they'd give us
                 a copy of that?

369
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:59,633
You think they really rode      
     the carnal carrousel?

370
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,569
I think it's possible.

371
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,037
What a thought.

372
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,405
I know.

373
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,074
If you don't mind, I'd kind
        of like to forget it.

374
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,776
Hey, everybody.

375
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,678
This is Station WSAM.

376
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:14,681
50,000 watts of power-packed  
     love coming your way.

377
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,550
I'll be spinning        
 the platters that matter here,

378
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,987
and this next moldy oldie is  
  dedicated to the one I lust.

379
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:21,187
( <i>knocking</i> )

380
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:22,339
REBECCA:    
                      Who is it?

381
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,257
The Righteous Brothers.     
                    Uh-oh.

382
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:27,928
Hello there, butter knees.

383
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:37,271
¶ Whoa, my love

384
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,573
¶ My darling

385
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:47,047
¶ I've hungered for your touch

386
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:54,588
¶ A long lonely time

387
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,627
¶ And time...

388
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:01,828
( <i>keyboard keys clattering</i> )

389
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:08,935
¶ Goes by so slowly

390
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:16,627
¶ And time can do so much

391
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:28,822
¶ Are you still mine?

392
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:31,391
¶ I need your love...

393
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,625
Rebecca, this tab, look...

394
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:40,567
¶ I need your love...

395
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,035
( <i>music stops</i> )

396
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:51,011
So, uh, I can pay this     
    anytime you want.

397
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,447
I don't know what got into me.

398
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,215
Please, apologize to Vera.

399
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:56,216
Are you kidding?

400
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,185
After that, Vera should     
        apologize to me.

401
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,842
Hey, Mr. Peterson, how'd        
it go with Miss Howe?

402
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,444
Much better than    
              I expected, Woody.

403
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,636
A slap on the wrist
                    she says.

404
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,805
With your record, all we'll get 
is a severe reprimand, she says.

405
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,173
So what happens?

406
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:26,396
She gets fired and I get six  
 weeks walking dreaded Zone 19.

407
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,714
Zone 19?

408
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,018
Rottweiler Ridge, Norm.

409
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,455
Oh, what the heck.

410
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:39,893
At least I won back the respect 
of the woman I love, huh?

411
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:43,530
Maggie,             
    what are you doing here?

412
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,232
Cliff, I've got to talk to you.

413
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,316
What's up?

414
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,235
After I was fired, I wandered  
    around aimlessly,

415
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,938
nowhere to go and didn't know  
          what to do.

416
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,141
And as I was crossing           
the bridge,

417
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,909
I actually thought I'd do       
something desperate.

418
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:57,210
Oh, no, you don't mean...

419
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:59,546
Yes, UPS.

420
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,269
Then I thought, why             
should I do that?

421
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,905
There are alternatives.

422
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,940
And I came up with              
a wonderful idea.

423
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,275
The Canadian Postal Service.

424
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,777
Canada?

425
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,779
Geez, why would you want
                 to go up there?

426
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,314
The mail's the mail, Cliff.

427
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,249
It knows no national boundaries.

428
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,851
Come with me.

429
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,086
What?

430
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,386
I've got two tickets, Cliff.

431
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,255
We could start a new life       
there together.

432
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,257
Geez, Maggie, I don't know.

433
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,843
Go, marry her, be happy.

434
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,712
Just don't have any children.

435
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,203
What the heck, I mean,
        we've come this far.

436
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,305
We might as well go the whole   
                nine yards, huh?

437
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,240
Let's go!

438
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:43,907
Hold on a second.

439
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,525
I'll be right with you.

440
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,760
Normie, pal of mine,

441
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:49,796
I'll be seeing ya.

442
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,365
It's for the best.

443
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,800
Cliff, did you just kiss
                 me on the neck?

444
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,034
I don't know what it is.

445
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:57,137
Nobody can keep their   
              lips off me today.

446
00:20:58,572 --> 00:20:59,823
Fras, take care of yourself.

447
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,074
Carla, I forgive you.

448
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,709
Sammy.      
Cliff, wait a minute.

449
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,427
Hey, man, just think about this 
for a minute.

450
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:05,662
You've only known the girl      
for about a week.

451
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:09,966
I mean, all you've shared is one
night in a motel and a huge lie.

452
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,785
That's enough for me, Sammy.

453
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,455
Cliff, why don't you consider

454
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:17,291
what you'd be giving up.

455
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:20,527
Your job, your seniority,       
your pension.

456
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,297
Hey, Doc, have a gander

457
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:24,965
at what I'm going   
                  to be gaining.

458
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,534
All right, Maggie, hitch up   
         those huskies.

459
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:29,136
Canada, here we come.

460
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,605
Uh, Cliff, Cliff...             
Wait a minute, man.

461
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:32,473
Give this some thought.

462
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:33,974
Think about what                
you're doing here.

463
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:36,843
I know what you guys are doing,
            and I appreciate it,

464
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:39,313
but there's nothing you
                 could do or say

465
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:41,581
that would make me
            change my mind.

466
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:46,153
¶ Fearless men who jump     
        and die ¶

467
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:50,774
¶ Men who mean         
      just what they say ¶

468
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:55,395
¶ The brave men         
     of the Green Beret. ¶

469
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,831
( <i>all humming "Ballad</i>      
      <i>of The Green Beret"</i> )

470
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:05,205
( <i>humming continues</i> )

471
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:12,112
Margaret, you're
                 a fine woman,

472
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:16,383
but I can't leave   
                     my country.

473
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,252
( <i>humming continues</i> )

474
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:22,573
My place is here,   
                     in America.

475
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:26,410
I can't leave my home.

476
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:30,147
Can't you, can't you
             stay here with me?

477
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,015
I'm a mail carrier, Cliff.

478
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,984
I have to deliver               
the mail.

479
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:38,922
I understand.

480
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,657
( <i>humming continues</i> )

481
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,892
But Cliff, it'll be             
so terrible.

482
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,295
I'll... I'll be so cold         
and all alone.

483
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,332
Who will keep me warm?

484
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,768
You'll do fine, Margaret.

485
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,804
Women have that
             extra layer of fat.

486
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:04,014
Carry on, O'Keefe.

487
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,750
I'll never forget               
you, Cliff Clavin.

488
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:09,686
Good-bye.

489
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:16,476
¶ 100 men will test one day

490
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,980
¶ But only three wear      
    the Green Beret. ¶
