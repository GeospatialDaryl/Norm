00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:07,597
CLIFF'S ROCKY MOMENT

2
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:12,018
Someone just ordered
one of your famous Kon Tiki Tikis.

3
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:17,190
No kidding. I haven't made one of those
in a Iong time. This wiII be great.

4
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:24,406
I Iove watching you make this.

5
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:28,535
It's Iike watching
Beethoven pIay a tune.

6
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,787
Thank you, CarIa.

7
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:56,229
There you go.

8
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,526
- You forgot to bIend it.
- I haven't made one since Iast summer.

9
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,737
I know.

10
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:06,614
Here we go.

11
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:28,905
With the recent strides
in genetic engineering,

12
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:34,077
we'II soon produce enormous farm
animaIs to feed the hungry miIIions.

13
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:40,875
Imagine one cow to feed a city, one egg
making an omeIette for a whoIe famiIy.

14
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:45,964
With the advances we're making,
the future is IimitIess.

15
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,634
So is his mouth.
Doesn't he ever shut up?

16
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:53,429
- Who?
- Gabby, the wonder boob.

17
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:57,392
Is that humorous appeIIation
supposed to refer to me?

18
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:02,897
Yeah. You reaIise your Iips have been
fIapping for over an hour?

19
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:05,733
Give it a rest, paI, and give us a break.

20
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,196
- Doesn't seem fair, does it?
- What?

21
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:15,410
That I have so much knowIedge and
some go to bed stupid every night.

22
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,457
Watch your step, paI.

23
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,171
I guess I did carve the guy up a bit
with my rapier wit.

24
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:30,967
Better go and scrape him up off the mat.

25
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:38,391
Listen, friend. We got off on the wrong
foot. Let me buy you a beer.

26
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,769
- TaIk it over Iike decent human beings.
- No, thanks.

27
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:43,771
I don't Iike you.

28
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,991
How did it go?

29
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,954
The guy's taken
an inexpIicabIe disIike to me.

30
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,373
Must be deranged.

31
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,753
Have you fiIIed in your footbaII pooI yet?

32
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:09,255
I gotta pick up the sIips in haIf an hour.

33
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:11,507
I'm working on it.

34
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,968
- I'm aImost done with mine.
- Good girI.

35
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:16,220
Yours?

36
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:21,893
Why do you even bother to fiII one out?
You don't even Iike footbaII.

37
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:29,067
I don't disIike it. BeIieve it or not,
I was on the pep squad in high schooI.

38
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:36,532
Some of my most stirring memories
are of cheering for whomever it was

39
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,453
to do
whatever they were supposed to do

40
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,039
to whomever
they were supposed to do it.

41
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:48,169
Spirit Iike that can reaIIy fire a team up.

42
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:51,172
- In the first contest...
- Wait.

43
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,926
You don't know the first thing
about footbaII.

44
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:59,263
- Who won the pooI Iast week?
- You've never been to a game before.

45
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,350
- Who won?
- You don't watch it on teIevision.

46
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:05,561
- Who won?
- You won, you won!

47
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:09,482
OK? You won.

48
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,319
Anybody can win every once in a whiIe.

49
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:17,406
Everybody gets Iucky.
It's the Iaw of averages.

50
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,120
Just out of curiosity,
when was the Iast time you won?

51
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:27,959
1 97 4, but I've come cIose
a Iot of times since then.

52
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,211
It was a decade of upsets.

53
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,471
AII right. Are you interested
in winning consistentIy? Sit down.

54
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:43,724
Watch and Iearn.

55
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:47,228
Sammy's putting on his thinking cap.

56
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:50,773
It's a wee, pointy IittIe thing
with ear fIaps.

57
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,735
But on you, it Iooks roomy.

58
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:02,493
Top of the page.
Bears against the DoIphins.

59
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:09,000
Now. We have a home fieId advantage
which means you've got to be...

60
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,252
Bears.

61
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:17,508
- Bears, just Iike that?
- Of course. A bear against a doIphin?

62
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:25,057
I mean, that's not even a fair fight. What
about the DaIIas guys against AtIanta?

63
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:29,478
AII right. AtIanta.

64
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,815
- What coIour uniforms do they wear?
- CoIour?

65
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:36,193
The coIour wiII teII you the winner.

66
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:40,072
Red beats bIue, bIue beats yeIIow,
yeIIow beats mauve.

67
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:45,786
Wait. Are you teIIing me you're going to
pick AtIanta over DaIIas

68
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,331
because of the coIour of the uniforms?

69
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,709
DaIIas untiI Iast week
had won six games in a row.

70
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,545
- Who beat them Iast week?
- Washington.

71
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:57,298
What coIour was Washington wearing?

72
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,717
None of your business.

73
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,889
- The Iaws of probabiIity are compIex.
- Indeed.

74
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:13,022
Professors at HeideIberg have done
studies to predict reocurrence of...

75
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,900
Oh, God.
Time for the Mickey Mouth CIub again.

76
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:23,157
Buddy, you don't know anything, so why
don't you shut up before you prove it?

77
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,459
I'm ashamed to know you
if you don't stand up to that guy.

78
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,711
Let it ride, wiII you?

79
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,922
What, are you scared?

80
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,134
I don't want to start a fight
over a few hasty words.

81
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:44,387
Come here.

82
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:51,352
Look. You won't have to fight him. You
just have to back him down a notch.

83
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,855
Trust me. I've been in a Iot of fights
and seen a Iot of fights.

84
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:58,359
BeIieve me,
fighting is the Iast thing on his mind.

85
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:05,032
You just caII him out, stare at him eyebaII
to eyebaII, and watch him crumbIe.

86
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,868
Like two fighters stare each other down
before a bout.

87
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:11,705
You got it.
The name of the game is intimidation.

88
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:14,625
ReaI men have been doing it
for centuries

89
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:18,045
and it can work for guys Iike you, too.

90
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,176
- You think it'II work?
- I'm positive.

91
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,847
That guy is a bIowhard.
Want me to do it for you?

92
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:30,766
Look, I can do it myseIf, aII right?

93
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:36,272
- WiII you do something about this?
- About what?

94
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,696
CarIa is provoking CIiff into a physicaI
confrontation with that Iout.

95
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:47,241
I toId you I don't want anything
more vioIent in my bar

96
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,869
than an occasionaI Iove nibbIe.

97
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:53,414
That'II never work with this guy.

98
00:08:55,791 --> 00:09:00,671
Look, it's aII right.
There won't be any fisticuffs.

99
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:05,134
I'm just going to go over, stare him down,
and he'II be the first to bIink.

100
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:09,388
- Wait, man.
- No. It's something I've got to do.

101
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,640
The gauntIet has been thrown down.

102
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,313
Hey. BeagIe breath.

103
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,985
You'd better not be taIking to me, paI.

104
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,571
If you don't Iike the way I taIk,

105
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,366
maybe there's something
you'd Iike to do about it.

106
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:35,706
I'd be gIad to. Let's go outside.

107
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,881
You got it.

108
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,258
I'II pay and be right behind you.

109
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,763
Did he bIink and I missed it?

110
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:56,268
Don't worry. He knows you're not
afraid of him and he's worried.

111
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:59,063
I wouIdn't be surprised
if he's run by now.

112
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:03,025
No, he's out there right now
taking off his shirt.

113
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:05,944
Nice upper body deveIopment.

114
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:11,742
There comes a time
when you've gotta draw the oId Iine.

115
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:20,459
- Where are you going?
- Home.

116
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:23,921
You're going through MeIviIIe's?

117
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:29,593
It's the duty of every citizen
to Iearn the exits of pubIic pIaces

118
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,804
in case of an emergency.

119
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,014
FIood, atomic hoIocaust...

120
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:39,311
- What a chicken.
- Yeah, but what a citizen.

121
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,754
WeII, how did my Sammykins do
in the footbaII pooI?

122
00:10:57,963 --> 00:11:00,590
Not so great. But I wasn't the onIy one.

123
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:05,637
Oddsmakers took a reaI beating.
Nothing went according to form.

124
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,848
How many did you get?

125
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,058
I don't know. Let's see.

126
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:15,772
Five, six... Six out of thirteen.
That's not so bad.

127
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:20,110
- This. This.
- Yeah, OK. AII right. Five.

128
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,115
Four. AII right, four.

129
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,120
- Poor Sam.
- You kidding me? Poor everybody.

130
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:33,081
No win day.
Upsets right across the board.

131
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,836
I defy anybody to predict
how those games turned out.

132
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:41,047
How did you do?

133
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:45,677
WeII, I'm afraid
I didn't do very weII either.

134
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:51,475
I went with cities whose symphonies
are Ied by foreign-born conductors.

135
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:57,481
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- No.

136
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,733
Bet you did great with that system.

137
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,236
Not reaIIy. I onIy got eIeven.

138
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,242
WeII, the heck you did.

139
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:11,536
You got tweIve.

140
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:17,000
- TweIve out of thirteen.
- You're right, I miscounted.

141
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,629
And the one you missed,
you missed by a miIe.

142
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:24,716
There's a new ruIe.
AII bIonde waitresses out of the pooI.

143
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:27,344
You don't get to bet on footbaII
any more.

144
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:31,473
You are destroying the sport of footbaII.

145
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,978
OK, fine.

146
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:39,231
If it's so important to you.

147
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:45,070
But this makes it impossibIe
to test my theory on state fIowers.

148
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,669
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, CIiff.

149
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:04,130
Meet my post office paI here, Lewis.

150
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,636
- The whoIe gang.
- PIeasure to meet you.

151
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,888
Can I have a coupIe of beers here?

152
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:15,892
So what have you got
the muscIe for, huh?

153
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,896
What are you taIking about?
Lewis and I go way back.

154
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:25,151
Enjoy, Lewis.

155
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:29,114
- Thanks, Chris.
- It's CIiff.

156
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,116
My pIeasure.

157
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,412
You Iook Iike an athIete.
You pIay footbaII?

158
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,623
A IittIe bit. MostIy, I'm a fighter.

159
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,544
You're... You're a fighter?

160
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:46,589
You think you know a guy and
he can stiII surprise you Iike that.

161
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:48,842
I didn't know you were a fighter.

162
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,761
That's what you asked for
on the buIIetin board.

163
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,855
''Lewis the kidder'' -
that's what they caII him.

164
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:05,108
It's Sam. I want to put $200
on tonight's game.

165
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:09,320
Maybe you can heIp me out.
Which is the more dominant fIower,

166
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,949
the mountain IiIy or bIack-eyed Susan?

167
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:16,619
How am I supposed to know
LesIie Uggams?

168
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,874
Don't...

169
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:26,004
Don't get me wrong. It's not Iike I think
aII bIack peopIe know each other.

170
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:32,385
It's just aII good-Iooking peopIe
with Iots of warmth...

171
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:35,096
Can I have another beer, Coach?

172
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,690
Round one.

173
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:52,864
Come on. I'm a man of peace.
I'm wiIIing to Iet bygones be bygones.

174
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:58,161
If, on the other hand, my Ioud-mouthed
brothers were to start troubIe,

175
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,413
that's their business.

176
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,373
Scotch.

177
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:06,878
Did you hear about the studies
done at Johns Hopkins

178
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:11,591
about the Y chromosome
of persistent bar troubIemakers?

179
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:18,139
They found a striking simiIarity between
that and chronic drooIers and idiots.

180
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,350
OK, that's it.

181
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:22,560
Shut up, friend, and step outside.

182
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:26,564
This time you go first
so you can't give me the sIip.

183
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:33,863
I'd Iike to, but I think that'd be rude
to my enormous friend Lewis.

184
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:45,792
What's the probIem?

185
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,172
Wait. I got no quarreI with you, paI.
This guy here's getting on my nerves.

186
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,550
What exactIy is it about him
that bothers you?

187
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:59,847
I don't know. The fact that he comes on
as such an authority on everything.

188
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:04,310
- Hey. It's a free country.
- I know. I know it's a free country.

189
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:08,690
But it bugs me. He's got an opinion
on every subject.

190
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,900
He never shuts up.

191
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:17,490
You know, he does the same thing
down at the post office.

192
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,038
Nobody beats him up over it.

193
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:28,876
You know, his whoIe attitude
rubs me the wrong way.

194
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:32,839
I know what you mean.
Those kind of guys just do it to you.

195
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:38,970
- Who knows why?
- WeII, actuaIIy, socioIogy...

196
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:40,763
Shut up, CIint.

197
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:44,308
It's CIiff. Like another beer?

198
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,811
No. I don't think so.

199
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,565
I think I'm going home.

200
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,235
Let me give you a ride.

201
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:58,239
No. I don't want my neighbours
seeing me in a Studebaker.

202
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:09,000
Now, then.

203
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:14,964
I beIieve we were gonna step outside.

204
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:22,930
AII right.

205
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,146
AII right, Iook. I'm a bIack beIt in karate,
my hands are IethaI weapons.

206
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:35,651
Karate. Can you beIieve this guy?

207
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:39,822
TeII you what. I'II give you a chance
to get out of here.

208
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:42,825
I'm gonna go in the back
and pIay pooI.

209
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:46,120
You can say goodbye to your friends.

210
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,999
But Iisten.
If you're stiII here when I get back,

211
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,628
we're going outside
if I have to drag you there.

212
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,258
Karate, CIiff?

213
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:03,346
For crying out Ioud! God!

214
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:05,598
What is wrong with that?

215
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:10,061
- CIifford showed exceIIent judgment.
- Give me a break.

216
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:12,271
It's the oIdest cop-out in the worId.

217
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:17,151
Every sweetheart who wants to duck out
of a fight says, ''I know karate.''

218
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:21,906
WeII, that's where you're wrong, CarIa.

219
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:25,660
I've been studying secretIy now
for severaI years.

220
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:29,622
Very secretIy.
None of us heard a word about it.

221
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,793
Yeah, and we've heard a word
out of you about everything.

222
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,003
It's something we don't Iike to taIk about.

223
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,967
We don't brag about it
because it's spirituaI attainment.

224
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,513
What? What's funny?

225
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:51,018
CIiff, very prudentIy, in my judgment,

226
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:56,065
has refrained from taking advantage
of that combative mesomorph

227
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:59,527
with his superior knowIedge of karate.

228
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,738
- Right.
- Karate? CIiff?

229
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,119
<i>Et tu, Sammy?</i>

230
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:12,540
I'm sorry. Were you serious?

231
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:18,254
I hate to ask, but if you do know karate,
why did you have to bring Lewis in?

232
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:22,675
There's a very good reason for that.
It's to scare off the other guy.

233
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:25,720
It's one of our major precepts.

234
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:29,140
AIways stay out of a fight
if humanIy possibIe.

235
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,935
- AII right.
- WeII, I for one beIieve you.

236
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:36,314
- And I do too.
- And I beIieve you.

237
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:40,318
I beIieve you are a big dink.

238
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,289
Hey, Kung Fu.

239
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,084
I thought I toId you to get Iost.

240
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:00,588
What are you gonna do?
Throw my customers out?

241
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,965
I'm not Iooking for troubIe.

242
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:06,886
But this guy knows I don't Iike him
and he's been pushing me.

243
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:15,061
If he'II admit
that he's a coward and a Iiar,

244
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:18,189
I'II waIk away
and never bother him any more.

245
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,859
Come on. What's the point?

246
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:26,697
Admit it, coward. Or get out of here.

247
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,903
Happy, paI? You proved your point.

248
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,740
Why don't you get out of here?

249
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:12,284
Look, I'm sorry.

250
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:15,788
That guy brings out the worst in me.

251
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,669
Poor CIiff.

252
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:27,925
- I wonder if he'II ever come back.
- I wouIdn't if I was him.

253
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:30,135
I don't beIieve it.

254
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:33,556
- Can I knock off?
- I'II catch up with you Iater.

255
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:42,523
- Hey, CIiff.
- If you pIan to hit him with those,

256
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,109
you're too Iate, he Ieft.

257
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,319
These aren't for him.

258
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:50,823
These are for you, my so-caIIed friends.

259
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,576
Thanks. I need a brick.

260
00:21:57,788 --> 00:22:01,917
- Where did you get that stuff?
- Construction site next door.

261
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:05,588
Here's a demonstration of what wouId
have happened to that guy

262
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:08,215
if I hadn't kept a hood on my anger.

263
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:10,467
What's he doing with the shoe off?

264
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:15,514
You don't have to do this. Listen, this is
not something to fooI around with.

265
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:19,643
He is not fooIing around.
He's a bIack beIt.

266
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:25,482
- HoId it right there.
- I won't get a spIinter, wiII I?

267
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,570
Just keep a good grip on that.

268
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:32,990
You're reaIIy crazy. This thing is soIid.

269
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,200
It's just the way I Iike them.

270
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,077
SoIid.

271
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,501
Bravo!

272
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,342
Get that sucker back in here!

273
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:10,402
Now that I've proved my point,
goodbye to you aII forever.

274
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:16,200
Come on back in here
and Iet us set you up.

275
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,452
AII right.

276
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:21,080
But I'd Iike to have a IittIe word
with Diane.

277
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:23,290
AII right.

278
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:30,172
I've never taken a karate Iesson
in my Iife.

279
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,133
CouId you get me to a hospitaI quick?

280
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,643
Goodnight, everyone.

281
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,439
CIiff is...going to waIk me to my car
for my protection.

282
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:49,650
Anybody got a probIem with that?

283
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:03,831
Look at this.

284
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,543
