1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,955
Excuse me. I've got to powder
my nose in the men's salon.

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,389
You look a little like Tip O'Neill.

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,832
Yeah?
You know, a lot of people say that.

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,030
But I'm better-looking than he is.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,754
My God, you are Tip O'Neill!
How do you do?

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,075
I'm Sam Malone.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,156
You used to throw for the Sox.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,475
That's right.
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,309
I'm walking down the street
and a lady stopped me.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,710
Started to tell me her
philosophy of life and government.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,637
So I ducked in for a quick one.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,952
What can I get you?

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,752
There you are!

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,436
Mr Speaker, forgive me for being
relentless, but I want...

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,869
Diane, step into the office
for a minute.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,117
- What? I'll be right back.
- No, she won't.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,990
One more quick one,
then I've really gotta run.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,716
Norm, what were you saying about
that do-nothing Congress in DC?

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,673
- They're a bunch of clowns.
- You think so?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,075
Any average guy could do better.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,758
- Nah.
- Sure.

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,350
This bozo could probably be
a better Congressman.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,957
I may run for office someday.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,071
Yeah? You do that.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,199
You're out of work, too?

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,599
No, I'm Speaker
of the House of Representatives.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,633
Don't be ridiculous!

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,159
That'd make you Tip O'Neill,
and me... a horse's butt.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,838
You said it, not me.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,717
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,637
What can I do for you?

32
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,957
I need something to kill time
before my second beer.

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,470
- How about a first one?
- You got it.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,955
Glad you came in today. Big day.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,992
- What's going on?
- The Miss Boston Barmaids contest.

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,190
- They pick the finalist.
- What is it?

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,231
What is it?

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,433
It's only the biggest event of
the year. Words can't describe it.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,270
Waitresses serve drinks
and one wins.

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,879
Yeah, that's about it.

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Coach is particularly excited today.

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,356
This year, the contest
is being held right here at Cheers.

43
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,879
Alright! Is that right?

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,231
I hate to burst your bubble,
but the contest's a phoney.

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,954
You gotta fool around with the judge
to get in.

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,356
- That's disgusting!
- Yeah, and he won't return my calls.

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,751
Everybody, I want your attention.

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,348
They picked the finalists
for the contest.

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
And this year, Cheers is gonna win.

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,551
Finally, they're letting in preggos!

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,433
No, Carla, it's not you. It's Diane.

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,757
- Diane's pregnant?
- No, no.

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,118
She's a finalist, Coach.

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,875
Give me a copy!

55
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,673
That proves it. There is no God.

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,671
She didn't say a word about it.

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,031
She doesn't know about it.
I entered her without telling her.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,833
Why, Sam? Just to cause me anguish?

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,878
Alright, she's not the best waitress
in the world.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,913
But she makes the other categories.
"Perky, pert, congenial and fun."

61
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,429
And I don't?

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,789
Sweetheart, you cannot join
the contest. You're pregnant.

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,070
So? Proves I'm congenial.

64
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,673
- Good point.
- Sammy, here she comes.

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,349
I want this to be a surprise.
Pretend you don't know anything.

66
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,790
Coach, grab her apron. Put it
next to the paper so she sees it.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,590
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,915
You all look chipper today.
What's up?

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,597
Come on! I hate this.

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,393
- Tell me.
- Really, it's nothing at all.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,319
Something in the paper?

72
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
"The Miss Boston Barmaid compet..."

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,912
I hate female contests
with every fibre of my being.

74
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,598
Why did you want me to see this?

75
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,874
To make sure you felt
the same way we did.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,355
- Disgusting.
- Terrible.

77
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,712
What ninny would let herself
be entered in a contest like that?

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,114
This kind.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,471
- That's me!
- Takes guts to admit it.

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,309
Who did this? Who is responsible
for this? I'll kill him!

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,913
- You did this.
- That's it. Wong Song You.

82
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,358
He got killed in the Orient
trying to rescue a nun.

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,595
That's him.

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,191
You entered me much as one
would enter a heifer in a fair.

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,675
No. Come on, Diane.

86
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,279
I mean, no.

87
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,198
The judges come in,
secretly watch your work,

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,117
and then pick the finalists.

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,232
In a county fair,
you take the cow to the judges.

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,548
- Thanks a lot, Coach.
- Any time.

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,238
Come on, Diane.
I thought you'd be happy about this.

92
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,998
Of course.

93
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,510
I love being entered
in degrading female contests.

94
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,949
Me, too, but I'm always pregnant.

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,597
Come on. This is not degrading.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,554
- In Boston, it's a very big honour.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,470
Di, it's really big, you know.

98
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,750
Not as big as Mail Carrier
of the Year, but it's up there.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,393
Mail Carrier of the Year?

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,751
Who do they give that to?
A postman or a pigeon?

101
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,596
- Watch your mouth.
- It was a joke.

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,757
Yeah?
Don't you ever, repeat, ever,

103
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,350
joke about the US postal service
in front of any mail carrier.

104
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,313
- Alright?
- He didn't mean anything by it.

105
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,796
I'd like to see how fat and sassy
he'd be without his mail.

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,957
- I don't know what came over me.
- That's OK. You had every right.

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,350
The Post Office
is everybody's target.

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,711
But when they want a letter fast,
who do they come to?

109
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,832
- Federal Express.
- He's mine!

110
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,194
Sit down!

111
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,788
These contests perpetuate
the attitude

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,115
that women are mere objects,

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,199
to be judged and ranked in respect of
how well they serve man.

114
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,108
Come on! Lighten up, will you?
Relax a little bit.

115
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,913
This is not the UN. Have some fun.

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,036
Do you think being scrutinised,

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,958
poked and prodded
like a side of beef is fun?

118
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,231
Not every day,
but on your odd Saturday night...

119
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,949
What do you think I am?

120
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,278
Are you kidding? I thought you
were cute. Is that such a big deal?

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,879
Cheers has never won this.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,073
I thought might be nice if we did,
if you won it for us.

123
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,237
I didn't think. I picked up
the picture and sent it in.

124
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,712
Where did you get it?

125
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,110
I... Well, you know, I found it.

126
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,875
Found it where?

127
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,348
You were pretty careless. I found it
lying around in your wallet.

128
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,037
Don't go through my wallet again.

129
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,958
Don't worry. It was boring.

130
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,470
Sorry. If I'd known, I'd have
added something interesting!

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,672
I never saw anyone
with so many pictures of themselves.

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,358
With your cat, on your pony.

133
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,392
You by your car
with your cat on your pony.

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,428
I'm going to call them,

135
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,552
tell them what I think of this
and that I won't do it.

136
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,716
Come on. Damn.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,432
Paul.

138
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,634
No hard feelings.

139
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,792
No.

140
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,798
The Sears catalogue
came out this week.

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,876
It puts a strain on me.

142
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,599
I would like to speak to the person
in charge of female dehumanisation.

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,154
What do you mean, "Speaking"?

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,959
This is in regard to the
Miss Boston Barmaid competition.

145
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,675
I am Diane Chambers. I have
something to say about this contest.

146
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,472
And all contests like it.

147
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,956
I only wish the whole world
could hear what I have to say.

148
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,756
There will be reporters there?

149
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,950
From all the major papers?

150
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,149
Well,... I guess if a contestant
had a few things to say,

151
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,158
this would be
an excellent forum for 'em.

152
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,872
Yes, I am every bit
as cute as my picture.

153
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,153
Thank you.
I'll see you at the contest.

154
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,631
Diane. I have one thing
to say to you, and I mean this.

155
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,354
Stay in this contest,
or we're no longer friends.

156
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,869
- I'm staying in the contest.
- Really?

157
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,078
- Yes.
- Diane!

158
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,749
You go to bed with me tonight,
or we're no longer friends.

159
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,472
Well, I guess you can
just push friendship so far.

160
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,756
Norm, hold this for me.

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,592
What smells great, Coach?

162
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,236
I just came from the barbershop.
They put on that zingy aftershave.

163
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,796
That explains
why these flies are dying here.

164
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,951
Diane. Listen, I've been to these
things before. I know what they want.

165
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,753
It's personality
and customer service,

166
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,997
but a nice appearance can't hurt,
know what I mean?

167
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,156
- Sex?
- No, not sex, a nice appearance.

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,276
If you lowered your blouse
off the shoulders...

169
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,072
Absolutely not!

170
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,239
Come on, just to check it out.
Come on.

171
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,355
That's very nice.

172
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,755
Maybe mess your hair up just a bit.

173
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,354
That's nice. Lean against the bar.
Elbow up here, like that.

174
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,154
Wet your lips a little. Pout.

175
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,678
That's good.

176
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,710
You said the judges
weren't looking for sex.

177
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,956
They're not. I am.

178
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,036
Just checked out the competition.
They look even better up close.

179
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,357
None of those girls have got
what I'm looking for.

180
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,153
- What's that?
- Low standards.

181
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,753
Come clean. One minute
you're against this contest,

182
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,713
the next you're all for it.
What's up?

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,350
You don't like this contest, do you?

184
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,399
It's a sham.

185
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,954
Carla, you'll be happy to hear

186
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,231
that I am going to
bring this contest to its knees.

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,956
I like it so far.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,072
When they introduce me,
I'm going to make a statement

189
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,875
denouncing those
responsible for this outrage.

190
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,236
I love it!

191
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,557
You know, there aren't many things
about you that I like.

192
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,672
In fact, there is nothing
about you that I like.

193
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,031
But I always say
all great friendships

194
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,357
start with
one small act of vengeance.

195
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,870
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,391
<i>Welcome to the 45th annual</i>
<i>Miss Boston Barmaid competition.</i>

197
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,559
First, each contestant will tell us
a little bit about herself.

198
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,472
Yvonne?

199
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,394
Hi, I'm Yvonne. I go to modelling
school. I'd like to be an artist.

200
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,872
Hi, I'm Jocelyn.
I like being a waitress.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,959
I'm saving my money to travel
around the world next summer.

202
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,157
Hi, I'm Bonnie. I have to say,
I really like being just what I am,

203
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,955
a cocktail waitress
in the best city in the world.

204
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,518
Boston.

205
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,949
Go!

206
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,956
My name is Diane Chambers

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,755
and I would like one day to be known
as the voice of my generation.

208
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,276
You see, I'm a humanist...

209
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,713
Aren't we all? Good luck. lf you win,
we'll be seeing you on <i>AM Boston.</i>

210
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,353
Just let...

211
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,394
<i>AM Boston?</i>

212
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,752
Right. They'll be here later to tape
the announcement of the winner.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,155
Let the games begin!

214
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,630
Diane Chambers, humanist.

215
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,753
Now, Yvonne will wait on the judges,
who'll ask will ask questions

216
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,553
designed to help us
get to know her better.

217
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,676
Hello, there. I'm Yvonne.
I'll be serving you.

218
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,836
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?

219
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,397
Can you recommend something warm,
sweet and perfect for the evening?

220
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,436
Irish coffee... or me.

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,150
And one gin and tonic.

222
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,553
I am moved, Cliff.
I'm visibly moved.

223
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,756
- Gonna be tough to beat.
- Now for our last contestant.

224
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,713
From here at Cheers,
Miss Diane Chambers.

225
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,149
Hello. I'm Diane,
I'm delighted to be your waitress.

226
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,748
- What can I get you?
- Screwdriver, please.

227
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,916
- What kind of vodka?
- Absolut.

228
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,951
Absolute-ly

229
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,633
- Chivas rocks.
- I'll have a beer.

230
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,069
- Imported or domestic?
- What do you recommend?

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,557
I'll find something nice for you.
Back in a jiff, with pretzels.

232
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,036
You were terrific!

233
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,948
- Wait, you dropped some cards here.
- Never mind.

234
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,958
"Women pitted against each other
in a display of servitude."

235
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,753
I don't know what it means,
but it's making me hot.

236
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,592
- I'll take my speech, thank you.
- What do you mean, speech?

237
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,633
I'm going to win this contest so
I can make a speech denouncing it.

238
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,548
Oh, my God! Is that what
you've been planning the whole time?

239
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,352
Sam, I have to do this.

240
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,270
I don't believe I could be so stupid.

241
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,472
I thought you might be
a regular person for once.

242
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,354
- I am not a regular person.
- You're telling me!

243
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,759
Sam, someday, you will realise
that I am doing the right thing.

244
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,716
Why do you always
have to do the right thing?

245
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,673
Do you see the rest of us doing it?
We're happy.

246
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,558
- May I go now?
- Yeah, go on. Help yourself.

247
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,239
By the way, just want to say, I'm
glad that under all this pressure,

248
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,954
we haven't seen
that facial tic of yours.

249
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,558
And you won't. Mind over matter.

250
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,352
St Pauli Girl.

251
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,870
Absolut screwdriver,

252
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,157
Chivas rocks and pretzels.

253
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,553
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

254
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,796
Is there something wrong, miss?

255
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,798
- What do you mean?
- Are you alright?

256
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,910
Well, I have this... facial tic.

257
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,150
But I... I believe that all of us
have obstacles to overcome in life.

258
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,068
And in the final analysis,
the true measure of greatness

259
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,159
is the severity of obstacles
one has had to overcome

260
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,271
in order to achieve one's goals.

261
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,758
I...

262
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,232
I may not be the most attractive
waitress here, or the most talented,

263
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,751
but I am a survivor.
I didn't come here to lose.

264
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,029
I came here to win.

265
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,550
I will beat them all.
I will beat any who come against me.

266
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,958
As God as my witness,
I will never be hungry again!

267
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,879
Ladies and gentlemen,
this year's Miss Boston Barmaid,

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,150
Miss Diane Chambers!

269
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,350
Congratulations, Diane!

270
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,675
- Is that <i>AM Boston?</i>
- Yes, it is.

271
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,276
I really didn't expect
to win this contest. It has...

272
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,870
Thank you. It has been quite...

273
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,156
It has been quite an experience.

274
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,875
Now, I would like to tell you
my feelings about this contest.

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,468
But first, let me tell you
what you've won.

276
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,149
- That's not necessary.
- Something every waitress needs.

277
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,637
Six months' worth of free
dry cleaning at Ritz Cleaners!

278
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,159
Thank you.

279
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,948
Contests such as these do nothing...

280
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,551
And for entertaining at home,
a Kitchen Helper food processor.

281
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,348
That's nice. I've always wanted one.

282
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,752
Ladies and gentlemen...

283
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,156
A $200 gift certificate
from Filene's Department Store,

284
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,114
where you can buy some new outfits
for that week-long vacation

285
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,949
you and a friend
will be taking to Bermuda!

286
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,150
Bermuda!

287
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,998
Oh, my God!

288
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,556
I sold out womankind

289
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,353
for a trip to Bermuda.

290
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,358
Don't feel so bad. Most people
would do it for the dry cleaning.

291
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,153
Come on.

292
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,155
I don't even think you did sell out.

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,476
- Of course I did.
- No, you let your feelings out.

294
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,388
For the first time in your life,
you were spontaneous. It was great!

295
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,510
It's not the first time I've been
spontaneous. May I have my purse?

296
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,629
I enjoy being spontaneous,
every now and then.

297
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,189
Whenever I think it's appropriate.

298
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,153
You're a maniac.

299
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,558
OK.

300
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,154
Maybe I do tend to be
a little uptight at times.

301
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,396
Maybe this bar is changing me.

302
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,353
Maybe the atmosphere
is rubbing off a little.

303
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,708
Maybe.

304
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,949
And maybe, in some small way,
I'm the better for it.

305
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,159
Maybe you are.

306
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,392
Maybe I should thank you.

307
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,636
Maybe you should.

308
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,275
Like how?

309
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,878
Forget it.

310
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,278
Come on, you really want
to make it up to me?

311
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,358
Let's go to Bermuda.
You got two tickets.

312
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,071
Don't be coy.

313
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,158
Alright, I know I've made
a lot of passes at you.

314
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,317
But take me to Bermuda,
I'll be the perfect gentleman.

315
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,397
- You will?
- Cross my heart.

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,479
Then forget it.
