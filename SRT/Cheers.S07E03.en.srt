in a managerial position.       

246
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm here for a meeting          

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,300
with the new Executive          
Vice President, Mr. Teal.       

248
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,500
                    Ooh.        

249
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
                He's tough.     

250
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,100
                You nervous?    

251
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,400
        Hardly.                 

252
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,000
I've seen so many suits         
come and go,                    

253
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
that now I just take them       
in stride.                      

254
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,700
                  I admire that.

255
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
                 Of course, I   
                 admire anything

256
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,500
                with those dark 
                smoldering eyes.

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Excuse me.                      

259
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
            If you would like...

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,100
        It's getting a little   
        crowded in here.        

261
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,000
                  Maybe we could
                  continue this 
                  conversation  

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,300
            over dinner tonight.

You're asking <i>me</i> to dinner?     

265
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,200
        Dinner and who knows?   

266
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,800
        Oh.                     

267
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, that sounds fine.         

268
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,300
Should we take my car,          

269
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,100
or will your mommy              
be driving us?                  

270
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,800
                        What?   

271
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Oh, and I have                  
one other strict rule.          

272
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
I like all my guys              
to eat all their nice vegetables

and not spill anything

Mr. Teal, your secretary must   
have stepped out for a moment.  

277

I'm Rebecca Howe.               

278
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,900
What an honor                   
to meet you, sir.               

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
                No, no, no, I'm

280
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
             I am.

my administrative aide.         

283
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm so sorry, Mr. Teal.         

284
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,200
    I didn't realize that...    

285
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,000
      My age probably threw you.

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
As it often does.               

287
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,500
                      After all,

288
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
how many corporate executives   

289
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,300
have graduated                  
from Harvard at 18,

291
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,200
and assumed                     
a major leadership role         

292
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
while still practically         
in the flower of their youth?   

293
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,900
                    He's fair   

294
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,300
but firm,                       
and hates yes men.              

295
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,100
    Thank you, Dennis.          

296
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,400
Yes, sir.

                Get the door.   
     Right.                     

298
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,500
        I called this meeting   

299
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,100
          so that we could      
          get better acquainted,

300
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,400
    but now I don't suppose     
    that's necessary.           

301
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
     Believe me, Mr. Teal,      
        I would...              

302
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,600
     May I call you Mister?     

303
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,400
          I would never have    
          been so harsh with you

304
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,900
          in that elevator if...

305
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,200
             I hadn't been so...

306
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,700
 powerfully tempted to say yes. 

307
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,900
and I couldn't, because         

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
    I make it a policy          
         to never date          

309
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
    anyone in the company.      
            Mistake.            

310
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,900
 I think that's a good policy.  

311
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
     Oh, as a policy, yes.      

312
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
  I missed the "policy" part.   

313
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,400
                    TEAL:       
                    Yes, I think

314
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,900
that's a very good policy.      

315
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,300
    That's why I've decided     
    to have you terminated.

319
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,600
      Oh, thank you, sir,       
     for easing the tension     

320
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,800
    of what could have been     
    a very difficult moment.    

321
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,500
Yes, I think it's               
a very good policy              

322
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
not to date                     
fellow employees.               

323
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,500
        But, of course,         
I'm not an employee, Miss Howe. 

324
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,700
        I'm an employer.        

325
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,900
    That's true, sir.           

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
    In light of that,           
  would you like to reconsider  

327
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,800
  my earlier offer of dinner?   

328
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, well, now you're forcing me 

329
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,300
  to tell you the <i>real</i> reason   

330
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,700
     why I couldn't accept      
          your poetic           

331
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,100

    very touching proposal.     

332
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,000
  And that reason is that I...  

333
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,300
  You're seeing someone else?   

334
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,100
        That's it!

You're a wonderful man.         

352
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,000
    And I want to assure you    

353
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,700
        that our earlier        
        misunderstanding        

354
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
        will have absolutely    
        no bearing on our       
        working relationship.   

355
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
         Good.

              I hope you'll     
              forgive me, though

                      if I do...

Nothing would make              
my eyes happier, sir.           

361
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
                Well, then,     
                there's hope.

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,500
        May I ask               
    why you're calling him?     

367
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,200
    Oh, I just thought          
      I'd introduce myself      

368
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
      have a little chat.       

369
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,500
 I didn't get where I am today  

370

    without sizing up           
    the competition.            

371
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
         And I suppose          
      you'll be mentioning

my relationship with Sam.       

373
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,200
         Might come up.         

374
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,000
  Then I'd better come clean.   

375
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,000
         He's at lunch.         

376
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,800
Call him back in an hour.       

377
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
It's a bit late for lunch.      

378
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,100
    He had a big breakfast.     

379
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,000
  I have to run, sir. Bye-bye.  

380
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Okay, little bee buddies!       

381
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,600
Here comes dinner!              

382
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
  Equal parts sugar and water.  

383
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,400
Can you blame 'em for loving it?

384
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
Sure nobody wants to help?      

385
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
 No, they're all yours, Woody.  

386
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,500
  Okay, but you haven't lived,  

387
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,900
  till you've heard the soft,   
      warm, contented hum       

388
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,600
      of a well-fed hive.

390
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,300
         That's not it.         

391
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
Those bees loose in there?      

392
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,600
  It's nothing to worry about.  

393
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,900
        I'll just go in         
    and round them up.          

394
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,800
      My Uncle Fergy sent       
      his beekeeping gear       

395
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,900
     in one of these boxes.     

396
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
CLIFF:                          
I, uh, don't                    
mean to be                      

397
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,500
an alarmist, or anything,       

398
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,900
    but I think I saw           
one of those bees fly out       

399
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
when you closed the door.       

400
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
          I, uh, well,          
I sort of have this thing       

401
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,700
      about, uh, insects.       

402
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
        Relax, Frasier.         

403
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
    The last thing that bee     
wants to do is sting you.       

404
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,700
      Stings you, he dies.      

405
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
             True.              

406
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,700
  Unless, of course, it's one   
  of those rare, rogue bees.

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
CARLA:                          
Oh, Frasier, there he is!       

408
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,900
He just flew                    
down your shirt!                

409
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,600
                    I was wrong.

410
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
                  It was just a 
                  piece of lint.

411
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,800
Well, thank goodness you told me

412
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,500
before I made a fool of myself. 

413
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,000
        I'm ready, guys.        

414
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,300
             The smoke will calm
             them right down    

415
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,800
    so I can get them           
         all rounded up         

416
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,500
     before Miss Howe even      
    knows about this.           

417
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
    Oh, hi, Miss Howe.          

418
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
                     Uh, listen,

419
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,100
 I was wondering if I could use 
    your phone for a second,    

420
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,500
          in private,           
    with you not in there--     

421
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
not that there's anything wrong,
          or anything.          

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,900
         Why would I think that?

                your meeting go?

426
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
It was very nice.               

427
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
I met the new boss Mr. Teal.    

428
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,500
We exchanged pleasantries.      

429
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,000
        You're no longer        
         the co-manager         

430
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,300

431
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,100
                        Demoted?

432
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
                 Just like that?

433
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,500

            didn't even         

434
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
        have the courtesy to    
        give me a phone call?   

435
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,500
By the way, Sam,                

436
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100

this afternoon.

You've been demoted.

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,800
    Why didn't you tell me?

some really good news, though.
