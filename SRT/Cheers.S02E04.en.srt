00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,324
HOMICIDAL HAM

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,952
- Hiya, Sam.
- Hey, CarIa.

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,665
- Did you just get pregnant?
- No. I couId, but this is just stuffing.

4
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:18,294
- Why?
- I'm a IittIe short and my rent is due.

5
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:21,088
And pregnant women get better tips.

6
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:27,303
It's dishonest, Sam.
You shouId teII her to get rid of it.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,847
I can't do that. She's CathoIic.

8
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:36,771
Watch it. I'm in a famiIy way here.

9
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,991
The kid's going to be a swimmer.

10
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,446
WouId you Iook at that?
Some idiot carved his initiaIs on my bar.

11
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:15,411
It's his initiaIs and his girIfriend's.
It's sweet.

12
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:21,542
No, it's not sweet. It's destructive.
I mean, who did that?

13
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,420
SM pIus DC.

14
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:35,306
- I think it's romantic.
- No, it's not romantic. It's stupid.

15
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:40,102
If you want romantic,
we couId have our buns tattooed.

16
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,275
Worth a shot.

17
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:48,861
I'm just going to run a tab for you.

18
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,282
Excuse me.

19
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:00,497
May I speak with you for a moment,
pIease?

20
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:08,923
Don't you recognise that man?
The ex-convict you paid to date me.

21
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:14,470
He murdered a waitress
and fantasises his hands are cIaws.

22
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:18,057
Oh, yeah.
How do you happen to remember him?

23
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:21,894
Of course I recognise him.
His name is Andy. So what?

24
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,146
So what is he doing here?

25
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:27,566
I don't know.
He probabIy came in for a drink.

26
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:32,571
As soon as you hang a sign out
that says ''bar'', you start getting that.

27
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:38,869
Sam, you have to get rid of that kiIIer.
He's dangerous.

28
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,914
Look at him.
Does he Iook dangerous to you?

29
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,629
- Not at the moment...
- He's a customer. That's aII.

30
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,049
He has every right to be here.
Now, don't worry.

31
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,386
If he starts anything,
I know how to handIe him.

32
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,430
- Hey, Andy, isn't it?
- That's right.

33
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:02,601
- And you're Sam.
- Correct. What'II you have, Andy?

34
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:06,105
Everything in the cash register, Sam.
Freeze!

35
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:10,526
Everybody just take it easy here. I'II...

36
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:16,448
- No. Let the other guy get it.
- Ernie Pantusso. CaII me Coach.

37
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,871
- We've gotta heIp Sammy.
- What can we do?

38
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:26,333
Maybe we can jump the guy.
He's not that big.

39
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,753
The gun is big. The gun's definiteIy big.

40
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,175
Maybe Diane couId run in circIes,
fIapping her arms, and draw his fire.

41
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:42,266
Stay out of this.
Me and Norm wiII handIe it.

42
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:46,478
- What do you want me to do?
- We gotta do something. Trust me.

43
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:51,483
Statistics show 33% of the time
a guy wiII not use a gun if chaIIenged.

44
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,070
- So?
- If he's shot two peopIe, you're in Iuck.

45
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:02,161
Hey, foIks. I hope no one's
going to try anything siIIy here.

46
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:06,790
Take it easy. No one's going
to overpower you. It's not worth it.

47
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:13,922
Not even if I was a IittIe careIess and
Iet the gun drop onto the bar Iike that.

48
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,304
Maybe Iet my attention
wander round the room a IittIe bit.

49
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,477
Now!

50
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:36,320
- It's OK. CarIa's got him.
- Lucky for him.

51
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,532
OK, Sam. You got me.

52
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,911
- Watch where you point it.
- It isn't Ioaded.

53
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,121
It isn't?

54
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,249
It isn't!

55
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,837
CIiffy, suppose
this IittIe trickIe here's noticeabIe?

56
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:59,384
WouId you come here and watch him?
I'II see if the poIice answer their phone.

57
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,970
Good. I want to go back to prison.

58
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:05,974
- I can't make it on the outside.
- Have you reaIIy tried?

59
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,395
I've been beating my brains out.
No one wiII give me a break.

60
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:15,859
- No one wiII hire me. No one trusts me.
- What are your skiIIs?

61
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:19,947
I have no skiIIs. I'm worthIess.

62
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:24,785
Don't you have any ambitions,
any dreams?

63
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:29,331
- You'd Iaugh if I toId you.
- No, we won't.

64
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,794
I'd Iove to be an actor.

65
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,841
God bIess you, CIiff.

66
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:44,262
I did a IittIe acting in high schooI.
I think I was pretty good.

67
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,808
At Ieast it was an escape
from so many things.

68
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,395
So go and be an actor.
Why beIIyache to us?

69
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,189
Fat chance.
Nobody wiII even give me a Iook.

70
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:59,611
I'm going back where I beIong, out
of everybody's way. Prison is my home.

71
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:03,865
- The cops are on their way.
- TeII them not to come.

72
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,993
Go it. What? Why?

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,205
Why am I doing that?

74
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:15,544
When Andy shoved that gun
in your face, he was asking for heIp.

75
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,797
SiIIy me.
I thought he was asking for money.

76
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:23,927
He stands here as an embodiment
of the faiIure of our penaI system.

77
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:30,976
This man doesn't beIong in prison.
We, mostIy I, can save this man's Iife.

78
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,856
WeII, how are we, mostIy you,
going to do that?

79
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:41,611
Never mind that now.
CaII off <i>les gendarmes.</i> Trust me.

80
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,406
What are you going to do now, Diane?

81
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:49,286
WeII, I happen to know
Professor Sebastian DeWitt,

82
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:55,167
America's foremost drama coach.
He can spot an actor a miIe away.

83
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,628
That couId come in handy at a drive-in.

84
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,637
- OK, I caIIed the cops off.
- ExceIIent.

85
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:12,350
Andrew, Iisten to me.
Now, you want to be an actor.

86
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:17,397
I have experience as a director
in schooI. We're going to do a scene...

87
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:23,028
Later, Sam. Now, if I think
you're good enough, a very big if,

88
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:28,200
but if you are, I wiII arrange for
Professor DeWitt to see you perform.

89
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:31,620
He has contacts at every theatre
on the Cape.

90
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:38,084
I never expected this when I came
in here to stick up your bar.

91
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,589
You know the oId saying.
Use a gun, go to Cape Cod.

92
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:52,015
Why are you doing this for me
after our Iast experience?

93
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:58,104
WeII, I understand what peopIe
in the acting worId go through.

94
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,024
I did a bit of acting myseIf in coIIege.

95
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:04,694
ReaIIy? You couId be in my scene.
Were you good?

96
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:10,450
WeII, I don't Iike to brag,
but a Iot of peopIe Iove my work.

97
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:14,371
At Bennington,
they stiII taIk about my Tiny AIice.

98
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:17,624
Who wants a girI with a big AIice?

99
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:25,006
I know a book store that speciaIises
in theatricaI books.

100
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:29,260
Let's pick up some pIays.
Sam, may I have haIf an hour off?

101
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,723
You're right. I need an hour.

102
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,394
Diane, can I taIk to you here
for a second, pIease?

103
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,522
Excuse me.

104
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:48,071
You thought he was Jack the Ripper.
Now you're going browsing with him?

105
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:55,203
Now I know him. Sam, Iook at him.
Does he Iook Iike a dangerous person?

106
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,292
- He has done time.
- He made one smaII mistake.

107
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,796
He made a big one.
He's a murderer, Diane.

108
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:08,216
One murder does not
a murderer make.

109
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,347
OK, what I mean is,
he's not a murderer at heart.

110
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,767
Anyone who Ioves the theatre
Ioves mankind.

111
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:22,188
I don't think somebody
shouId go out with a crazy person.

112
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,692
- I can take care of myseIf.
- I was taIking about me.

113
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:33,199
Hie, thee, Andrew. Let us away.

114
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:44,878
I sense you are uneasy about your
empIoyee being in danger with me.

115
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:52,343
My crime occurred a Iong time ago.
I was a different person then.

116
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,681
I had one terribIe moment
of temporary insanity.

117
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:59,809
I'm much better now.
I'm much heaIthier.

118
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:03,688
I can't remember the Iast time
I heard those voices.

119
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:07,233
WeII, I'm gIad. What voices?

120
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,113
Those shriII voices
that used to sound Iike my...

121
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,158
...mummy.

122
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,953
I'm gIad you got it Iicked.

123
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:27,378
- Sam, pIease. ReIax. I'm better now.
- Come aIong, Andrew.

124
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:32,675
You thought...

125
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,887
But it wasn't...

126
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:47,397
A hard Ieft covered by two quick jabs.
Another Ieft. He stepped into that one.

127
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:49,691
A Ieft jab. A Ieft upper cut.

128
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:54,487
An overhead right across the forehead,
as they go into the corner.

129
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:59,242
- And that's the end of round six.
- It's beer time, Sammy.

130
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:03,872
Step right up, Iadies and gentIemen.
Good hands.

131
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:06,958
Keep moving. Here we go.

132
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,212
SIow it down. We onIy got
20 seconds, next commerciaI.

133
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,257
That's it. Good hands. Here we go.

134
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,347
There we go. AII right. Come on.
Move aIong there.

135
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:24,726
Come on. We got three Ieft.
We got two Ieft.

136
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:32,192
Sammy, what does a guy have to do
to get a beer round here?

137
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:36,571
This is the best middIeweight contest
we've seen in a Iong time.

138
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,865
Who wouId want to miss this?

139
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:45,288
AII right, boys, off, off. Andy and I can't
hear ourseIves rehearsing back there.

140
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:48,708
Professor DeWitt
wiII be here any minute.

141
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:57,342
I hope she's showing you
one heII of a good time.

142
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,888
Don't be nervous. You'II be wonderfuI.

143
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:06,643
I'm not nervous. It's just this week
has gone by so quickIy.

144
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,813
It's been the best week of my Iife.

145
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:15,735
- Miss Chambers.
- Professor, how good of you to come.

146
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:20,365
This is Andrew Schroeder, a young
man who is going to surprise you.

147
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,951
I hope so.

148
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:28,456
When the theatre Ioses
its power to surprise, it Ioses vitaIity.

149
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:31,417
- What first?
- A scene from ''OtheIIo''.

150
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:34,629
ChaIIenging.

151
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:42,345
It's certainIy nice to see you again.
I couId never picture you as a waitress.

152
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:47,308
You forget I pIayed a waitress
in your production of ''Bus Stop''.

153
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,519
Yes, I know.

154
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,481
Have fun. Break a Ieg.

155
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:03,157
- I can't beIieve you did this for me.
- You deserve it.

156
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:08,162
You're taIented and sensitive.
You have a Iot of depth.

157
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:13,293
- You know me so weII.
- I'm a pretty good judge of peopIe.

158
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,129
You are. You're wonderfuI.

159
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,301
- I Iove you, Diane.
- I Iove you, too.

160
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:25,430
You guys about ready?
Crowd's getting restIess.

161
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:31,019
If they don't hear some EIizabethan
coupIets soon, they'II turn ugIy.

162
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:35,398
I'd better get into costume. Excuse me.

163
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,280
AII right. Listen up. You were right
about Andy. I was wrong.

164
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:47,702
He's been a compIete angeI aII week.
My objections were stupid.

165
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,788
- Are you satisfied?
- Of course.

166
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,458
Put it in writing and we'II be fine.

167
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,668
Fat chance.

168
00:14:55,835 --> 00:15:01,632
Sorry I haven't been around much this
week, but it was important to heIp Andy.

169
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,926
It's been kind of tough.

170
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:09,974
WeII, Iater, when we're aIone,

171
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:14,896
- I'II make it up to you at my apartment.
- What time tonight?

172
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:26,115
Let's get the show on the road.
Good Iuck.

173
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,876
- Andy, what's the matter?
- You kissed him. I saw you.

174
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:40,296
That's aII right.
I guess it's no secret here.

175
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:43,257
Sam and I have sort of a thing going.

176
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:50,640
But I Iove you...and you said
you Iove me.

177
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,393
Oh, dear.

178
00:15:56,145 --> 00:16:01,400
No, I was speaking as a friend, Andy.

179
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:07,823
If I gave you any other impression,
I'm sorry. ReaIIy sorry.

180
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:12,995
I do Iove you, as a friend. OK?

181
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,831
Sure.

182
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,045
- You're not upset?
- No.

183
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:24,048
- You're not angry with me?
- That's OK.

184
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,385
I'II use it in my performance.

185
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,893
''Yet she must die...

186
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:41,023
''...eIse she betray more men.''

187
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,817
WonderfuI.

188
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:48,948
That was perfect.

189
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,912
''Put out the Iight

190
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,251
''and then put out the Iight.''

191
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,878
Andy, it's time. Are you ready?

192
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,427
Show foIk.

193
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,646
Good evening, everyone,
and weIcome to taIent night at Cheers.

194
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,406
This evening we begin with a scene
from WiIIiam Shakespeare's ''OtheIIo''.

195
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:34,201
I don't have to expIain the pIay
to Professor DeWitt.

196
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:41,500
But it might be heIpfuI to some of you
if I expIain what you are about to see.

197
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:45,171
I wonder who she's taIking about,
Norm.

198
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:57,308
In this pIay, Andrew Schroeder, my
discovery, wiII enact the roIe of OtheIIo.

199
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,518
Go, Andy!

200
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:07,943
This is the story of a man,
driven by insane jeaIousy,

201
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,366
to murder the woman he Ioves because
he beIieves she Ioves another man.

202
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,626
The scene we are about to do

203
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:29,048
is the scene in which OtheIIo
actuaIIy kiIIs said woman,

204
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:32,301
who wiII be portrayed by myseIf.

205
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:41,560
Did I mention
that I'm pIaying Desdemona?

206
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:46,941
OK, so without further ado, the strang...

207
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:52,696
...the stranguIation scene.

208
00:18:55,366 --> 00:19:00,371
But before we do, Iet's have
a IittIe background on the 1 6th Century.

209
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,581
Come on, Diane.

210
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:07,086
No more background.
Let's have the scene.

211
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:12,508
- Don't worry. Let me give you a kiss.
- Don't touch me. I bareIy know you!

212
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:18,889
AII right. On with the pIay.

213
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:23,269
In this scene, Desdemona is in bed,

214
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:28,440
when OtheIIo comes in, thinking,
very mistakenIy, I can assure you...

215
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:33,654
He's compIeteIy off-base on this one.
He'II be sick about it in the morning.

216
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:39,994
Thinking that she has been
unfaithfuI to him.

217
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,665
Which, of course, she hasn't.

218
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:10,024
It is the cause.

219
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,861
It is the cause, my souI.

220
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,658
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars.

221
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:22,786
It is the cause.

222
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:28,959
Yet I'II not shed her bIood,

223
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:33,422
nor scar that whiter skin
of hers than snow.

224
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,632
There. Good.

225
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:42,556
WeII, it's agreed. No bIood, no scarring,
the gist of our scene.

226
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:44,433
Oh, come on, Diane!

227
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:51,023
- What's wrong with Diane tonight?
- She got stage fright.

228
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,277
Diane, the sooner you start,
the sooner you'II be finished.

229
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:17,716
Who's there? OtheIIo?

230
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:22,638
Aye, Desdemona.

231
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,227
WiII you come to bed, my Iord?

232
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:36,568
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?

233
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:41,990
I wouId not kiII thy unprepared spirit.

234
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:49,790
TaIk... TaIk you of kiIIing?

235
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,168
Aye. I do.

236
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:58,090
He's convincing. There's
a reaI murderous intensity about him.

237
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:01,844
Then heaven have mercy on me.

238
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,180
Think on thy sins.

239
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:09,017
- Are you sure she's OK?
- Sure. She's just acting.

240
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:15,941
- ShouIdn't you make sure?
- Imagine what she'd say if I butted in.

241
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:20,863
Take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed!

242
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:25,826
I Iove it! A Desdemona that fights back!

243
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:32,207
HeIp! This psycho's trying to kiII me!

244
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:36,378
That's the onIy Iine of Shakespeare
I ever understood.

245
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:40,632
I saw you kissing Sam!

246
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,843
Kissing Sam?

247
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:47,598
- Someone heIp me, wiII you?
- Mummy!

248
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:50,392
I'II cIean up my room, Mummy!

249
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:04,364
What time's the second show?

250
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:12,664
I hope you fry for this.

251
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,752
Are you going to be OK?

252
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,259
- I'm having a IittIe troubIe breathing.
- No, I meant for tonight.

253
