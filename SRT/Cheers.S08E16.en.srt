hey, hey, guys, take a look.   
 Isn't that one                 
 of the righteous brothers?

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,427
Yeah. You see, robin colcord   
 flew him in to sing            
 to rebecca earlier.

00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:15,447
Wow! Which one is he?

6
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,248
I think                        
 that's righteous brother #2.

It's "top of the world."       
 "Top of the world."

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,029
The expression is              
 "top of the world."

 at little wally's,

she went into the ladies' room 
 to get some burger grease

68
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,066
off her blouse or something 
    and guess who pulls up.

            with another woman.

put an end                     
 to rebecca's celebrated        
 4 years of celibacy

73
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,029
than he's off baling hay       
 with some other wench          
 the very next night.

74
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,464
The man is absolutely          
 nothing more

75
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,700
than a rich, spoiled,          
 narcissistic philanderer.

76
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:42,103
I hate myself                  
 for envying him so.

77
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,945
Well, if rebecca's             
 still riding high,

78
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,247
i guess she doesn't know       
 about robin's other babe.

79
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,400
How'd she miss spotting him    
 at little wally's?

 off of wally himself.

84
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,594

             handle it, sammy?

85
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,512
Well, you know me,     
         daddy cool.

86
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,083
I figured if she came       
    out of the bathroom,        
    she'd see him, so...

87
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,718
well, i jumped in.         
     I think i handled it       
     pretty smoothly.

 but the more i think about it,

122

you know, the more i wonder    
 if i did do the right thing.

123
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:40,521
I mean, she should know        
 what that guy's up to          
 before she gets in too deep.

124
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,757
Maybe i should tell her.       
     Don't, sammy.

125
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:46,143
Take it from a mailman.        
 People want to kill            
 the messenger.

126
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,895
Or at least overturn his cart

127
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,314
and kick the mail              
 around the hallway.

00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,284
You know,                      
 i agree with cliff.

129
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,620
There's a great deal           
 to be said for discretion.

130
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,088
You know,                      
 it's entirely possible

131
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,424
that rebecca                   
 may grow tired of robin        
 all on her own.

132
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,593
Thus avoid the heartache.

133
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,196
And on the other hand,         
 as one who was cuckolded       
 by a lover deeply trusted,

134
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:09,433
the longer led on,             
 the--the harder the fall.

135
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,468
I'm just not sure              
 that rebecca can--

136
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,638
can be as strong

137
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,706
and forgiving                  
 as i was when...

138
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,343
that bitch diane dumped me.

139
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,605
Ah, you know, sam,             
 i had this cousin, skeeter,

140
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,907
who was in the army            
 a bunch of years ago.

141
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,676
Well, he never saw any action.

142
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:37,178
Although he did                
 blow off his thumb             
 in a mortar accident.

143
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,713
Big show-off.

144
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,316
Anyway, um, he was going out   
 with this girl,

145
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,318
and she went                   
 to the kiwanis dance

146
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,521
with this other guy,           
 laird danielson.

147
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,757
I saw them                     
 kissing and hugging            
 behind the propane tanks.

148
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:53,060
I was pretty much              
 in the same spot               
 as you are now.

149
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:54,395
What did you do?

150
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,798
Nothing. I'm waitin'           
 to hear what you do.

151
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,289
I'm gonna tell her.

152
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,025
There he is, my hero.

153
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,295
He was probably too modest     
 to tell you all,

154
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,447
but this man rushed me         
 through a burning building

155
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,349
with his coat over my face

156
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,118
and then led me                
 out of the fire.

157
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:20,988
And i am telling you           
 the fire was so close

158
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:24,258
that i could feel the flames   
 licking my ears.

159
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,662
It was hot, all right.

160
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,017
Anyway, sam, i just            
 want to thank you again        
 for saving my life.

161
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,335
Listen, there's, uh...

162
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,838
i probably should have     
     told you this last night.

163
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,773
[Clears throat]            
     sit down here, will you?

164
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,876
This is, uh, not going to be   
 very easy to tell you, here.

165
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:44,078
Um... come on,                 
 how do i start?

166
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:45,980
Ixnay, ammy-say,

167
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,147
The what?

168
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,482
[Gasps]

169

         My sweet baby.

170
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,589
A budding rose.

171
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,258
I brought it myself            
 because i didn't want you      
 to miss even a moment

172
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:58,459
of its bloom.

173
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,678
Oh, my god.        
             This is so cool.

174
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:07,802
Oh, robin, i can hardly wait   
 till we're alone together      
 again tonight.

175
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,987
Oh, yes, about tonight,        
 i'm terribly sorry.

176
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,657
An emergency board meeting     
 has been called.

177
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,208
How about a late supper 
        afterwards?

178
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,611
Yeah, well,                    
 the meeting could last         
 through the night, you know.

179
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,412
I could last       
             till the morning.

180
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,899
What say we put that           
 to the test tomorrow night,    
 huh?

181
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,166
All right. I'll rest up.

182
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,401
<i>Ole.</i>

183
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,470
Ow!        
         Are you ok?

184
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:27,938
No.

185
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,892
I'm fine. I'm fine. 
            I'm just gonna go   
            put this in water.

186
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:37,231
Sam, i want to thank you       
 for your discretion            
 last night,

187
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,633
that is, if running            
 alongside a screaming woman

188
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,703
with a sack over her head      
 can be called discretion.

189
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,955
That wasn't a sack,    
         that was my jacket.

190
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,374
Really? Please buy          
    one for me, huh?

191
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:51,012
Well, at any rate,          
    i want to thank you.

192
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,048
And as a man of the world,     
 i'm sure you've been           
 in similar circumstances

193
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,700
and know how embarrassing      
 it can be.

194
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,353
It was nice to find            
 an ally in a sticky situation  
 like that.

195
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,322
Ally nothing.              
     I just didn't want to see  
     rebecca get hurt.

196
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,773
Nor do i.

197
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,059
So i hope you'll keep up       
 your continued silence,

198
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,362
i mean, if the event           
 should ever repeat itself.

"Emergency board meeting."

200
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,917
You got another date tonight,  
 don't you?

201
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,819
Sadly, um, yes.

202
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,672
I don't think              
     i want to help you, pal.

203
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,074
Sam, you surprise me.

204
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,243
You and i have                 
 the same weakness.             
 Beautiful women.

205
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,578
I hoped,                       
 perhaps, men like us           
 shared a common bond.

206
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,680
Oh, no, we don't               
 share anything together here.

207
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,716
You know,              
         rebecca's my friend.

208
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,352
You got a lot of nerve         
 to think i'm gonna             
 help you cheat on her.

209
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,503
I see, you're taking           
 an ethical stand.

210
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,072
Well, let me counter           
 with this.

211
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,608
One phone call from me,        
 and you can                    
 have your bar back.

212
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,361
Why do you think        
        that you can always     
        buy anything--

213
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,530
the whole bar?

214
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:44,431
Uh-huh.

215
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,251

217
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,908
Ok.

218
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:57,895
I don't feel very good 
         about this, though.

219
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:01,049
Yes, well,                     
 you can, um, print that        
 on your cocktail napkins.

220
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,003
Well, i'm off for          
     a strenuous board meeting.

221

 all that thorn out,

222
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:16,397

 there's something in there.

Oh, sam, you said you had  
     something real important   
     you wanted to tell me?

226
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:22,836
Yeah.

00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:27,408
I think i just made a deal     
 to buy back the bar.

That's wonderful!

 that the, uh, harp here

 were much larger people.

Never mind.         
            I'll lug it myself.

263
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,556
Huh? Well, suit yourself.

264
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,842
I hear, they, uh, had hands    
 the size of small dogs.

265
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,570
Sammy, you got                 
 to stop rebecca.

266
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,339
You just got to tell her       
 before this goes any farther.

267
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:58,059
Yeah, come on, sammy,          
 put us out of our misery,      
 will you?

268
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:59,510
Yeah, sammy, come on.

269
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,279
She's thinkin' of replacing 
    the beer nuts with these    
    little candy hearts

270
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,314
that say, "hold me."

271
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,916
"I'm yours."           
         "Lovey-dovey."

272
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,185
Hey. "Free beer."

273
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,657
Oh, no, mr. Peterson.   
        Fool me once.

274
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,866
It's gotta be told now, 
        sam.

275
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,769
"If it were done   
             when 'tis done,

276
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,871
then t'were well       
         it were done quickly."

277
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,572
I'm sorry?                 
                Move it, pal!

278
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,977
No, i, uh,                     
 no, i've thought about it,

279
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,213
and, uh, i'm not               
 going to say anything.

280
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,815
I just, you know,              
 i think i'm doing              
 the right thing here.

281
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,853
I mean, come on, you guys,     
 what she doesn't know          
 won't hurt her.

282
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,122
Well, sam, you've proven to be 
 a big disappointment to me.

283
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,657
Aw, come on, man,  
             don't--

284
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,359
no, no, no. You know,          
 i always modeled myself        
 after you.

285
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,496
Well, i mean,                  
 not the way you're always      
 hung up on your looks,

286
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,098
that's kind of shallow,        
 really.

287
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,969
And not the chasing            
 after women part,              
 because that's kind of silly,

288
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,322
but the other part.

289
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,991
There is no other part.

290
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,692
Yeah, there is, sam.

291
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,062
There's a part of you          
 that's always lookin' out      
 for your friends.

292
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,382
I mean, that's the thing       
 about you that's made you      
 my hero,

293
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,552
but now, leaving miss howe     
 on the hook like that,

294
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:18,255
i may have to go back          
 to my old hero,                
 st. Thomas aquinas.

295
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,125
Guess what?

296
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:24,829
I found somebody        
        to sublet my apartment.

297
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:27,130
Why? You're moving?

298
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,050
Well, i can't expect robin  
    to live in my little hovel.

299
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,519
Um, you two are gonna          
 move in together?

300
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:34,789
Well, you know, i think     
    it's the logical next step.

301
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:36,824
You know, everything's been 
    going so well for me.

302
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,426
Man, i love the '90s.

303
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:39,977
 You've lost that--

304
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,979
hey, you start 
                 singin' again,

305
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,147
it's gonna be          
         a very short decade.

306
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,770
Uh, sweetheart,    
             wait. Listen.

307
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,322
Don't-- don't move out     
     of your apartment, honey.

308
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,593
Uh, i got something         
    i got to tell you.          
    Sit down here for a second.

309
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,960
What is it?

310
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:02,149
I know                         
 this is the last thing         
 that you want to hear,

311
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:05,519
and i sure as hell wish        
 i didn't have to be            
 the one to tell you.

312
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:07,304
Well, just go ahead 
            and tell me.

313
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:12,443
Robin is seein' other women    
 behind your back.

314
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:14,678
What?

315
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,697
There--there was no fire       
 last night, sweetheart,

316
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:20,067
just robin and some tall,      
 auburn-haired babe

317
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,569
with legs up to her eyes.

318
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:25,572
How can you do this to me? 
     What?

319
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,475
I mean, just because       
     you're jealous,            
     the first chance you get,

320
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:30,711
you have to try        
         and submarine robin.

321
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,348
You need help.          
        Real help, not frasier.

322
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:38,185
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

323
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,189
Listen to me a second here.    
 I'm telling you the truth.

324
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,841
I thought                  
     that you were my friend.   
 I am your friend, damn it.

325
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:47,178
I'll tell you                  
 how good a friend i am.

326
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:50,214
Robin was gonna buy            
 this bar back for me           
 if i kept my mouth shut.

327
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:54,235
Oh, brother!           
         How low can you sink?

328
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:58,572
Do you really expect me        
 to believe a stupid story      
 like that about my sweet baby?

329
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,124
Honey...

330
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,325
the guy doesn't have           
 a board meeting.

331
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,594
He-he's with that woman        
 right now.

332
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,697
I-- fine, fine.

333
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,498
I'm just gonna     
             prove you wrong.

334
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:11,218
I'm gonna go over there,       
 i'm gonna wait outside         
 that board meeting.

335
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,870
No. 
 Yes, i am.                     
 And then he's gonna come out,

336
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,839
and i'm gonna see him,         
 we'll smooch a little bit,

337
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:18,175
and then we will laugh         
 about you and your stupid      
 pitiful lies.

338
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,530
[Door closing]

339
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:26,600
well, i don't care         
     if she doesn't believe me, 
     i'll tell you...

340
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:29,637
you know, i--i feel good   
     about myself

341
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:33,840
because i told the truth    
    and you know, when it comes 
    right down to it,

342
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,576
i'll be able           
         to live with myself.

343
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,411
Sammy, come here.

344
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,346
Yeah? What?

345
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,483
You could have had             
 the bar back, you jackass!

346
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,557
Surprise, darling!

347
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,759
[Both screaming]

348
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:53,160
what's going on? Oh!

349
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:54,762
Robin, who is this?

350
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,664
Who am i?      
                 Who are you?

351
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:59,966
Well, i see introductions      
 are in order.

352
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,636
Christine davi,            
     new york city ballet,

353
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,606
rebecca howe,              
     proprietor of cheers.

354
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:08,141
Sam was right.

355
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:11,562
Oh, god, why does this 
         always happen to me?

356
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,865
How can somebody       
         as beautiful as i am   
         be such a loser?

357
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,454
Robin, i thought       
         we had something.

358
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:23,640
You're seeing her, too?

359
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,560
Well, this evening is off      
 to a rollicking start.

360
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,947
Robin, i am not    
             the kind of person

361
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,982
who fools around    
            with just anybody.

362
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,168
Are you saying i am?

363
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,670
Ballerina, why don't you   
     make like a swan and die?

364
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,910
Robin, i need      
             a one-woman man.

365
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,179
And i am               
         a one-woman man.

366
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:48,115
It's just that         
         i'm still looking      
         for the one woman.

367
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:51,735
But you can both take heart.   
 I've got it                    
 narrowed down to 3.

368
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:55,088
You two and a little           
  <i>chargee d'affaires</i>            
<i> in the french consulate.</i>

369
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,995
Well, i don't care             
 who you are.

370
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,730
I have my self-respect.

371
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:05,533
No one treats christine davi   
 like this.

372
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,601
Oh, uh--uh...          
         christine, uh...

373
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,441
so...

374
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,209
now i guess        
             it's down to 2.

375
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,246
Rebecca, you don't know        
 how lucky i am

376
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:22,015
to find                        
 someone so understanding       
 and compassionate as you are.

377
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,534
Not so fast, robin.

378
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,336
I have a little        
         self-respect myself.

379
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:30,074
You're gonna have to choose,   
 robin, right now.

380
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,842
Is it gonna be me

381
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,910
or your                
          <i>chargee d'affaires?</i>

382
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:38,282
Well, honestly,                
 i don't know.

383
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,484
Fine.

384
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,488
Then promise me you'll  
        think about it a while.

385
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,464
Hi, sam.               
                    Hello.

386
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:56,049
Well, i guess              
     i owe you an apology.

387
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,618
Ah, i'm sorry.

388
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,520
Feeling all right?

389
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:00,854
Me? Fine.

390
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,227
Well? Did you tell him 
         to take off?

391
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:10,581
No, sam. That would be         
 the easy thing for me to do.

392
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:11,999
Why, did you let him   
         off the hook?

393
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,351
Did he promise that he wasn't  
 going to see any more women?

394
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,738
No, sam. That would be         
 the easy thing for him to do.

395
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,574
Well, what are we      
         left with here?

396
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,761
A deeper understanding      
    of our relationship         
    and, uh,

397
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:28,081
what we, as mature adults,     
 are gonna do                   
 to make it work out.

398
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,385
You bought that?

399
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:35,205
For your information,          
 robin wants very much          
 to get married.

400
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,392
He does?   
 Yes, he does. To me.           
 Or one other woman.

401
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:42,712
He narrowed it down.       
     That's a nice touch.

402
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,048
Sam.                        
             Oh, come on.

403
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,750
Something worth having         
 is worth fighting for.

404
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,418
No. You sold out.

405
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,271
I absolutely               
     did not sell out.

406
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:53,140
I merely entered           
     a fair contest

407
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:57,228
where the payoff               
 would satisfy any woman's      
 wildest dreams.

408
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,562
You really believe that?

409
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,398
[Choking up]                   
 i believe                      
 every single word.

410
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,737
[Sobbing]              
         oh, boy.

411
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,990
What am i gonna do?

412
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:15,195
I feel so cheap                
 and so used, i think.

413
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:18,365
Oh, god, sam.                  
 I can't do this to myself.

414
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,951
I'm gonna have to break it off 
 with robin.

415
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,253
Well, it's the right thing 
     to do.

416
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,856
Oh, god, why do i feel         
 so miserable?

417
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,025
It's never the right thing     
 unless you do feel miserable.

418
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,077
I know.

419
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:34,164
I'm just gonna--               
 i'm just gonna tell him        
 it's over.

420
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:37,333
I'll just say to him, um...

421
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,104
that's it, sweet baby.

422
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,050
I mean, you know,              
 robin colcord is not worth     
 me losing my dignity.

423
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,586
Oh, yeah.

424
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,388
Dignity...

425
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,656
why not?

426
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:02,960
I've tried everything else     
 in my life.

427
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,794
Rebecca, i knew                
 i'd find you here.

428
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,730
That's fascinating.

429
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,316
Everyone else in the world     
 at the end of the evening      
 goes to their homes.

430
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,202
You people come to this bar.

431
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,188
This is your chance.   
         You give him hell.

432
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:18,442
I'm going to make him wish     
 he'd never been born.

433
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,280
Robin...

434
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,449
mr. Colcord--

435
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,551
rebecca, i'll be brief.        
 You were very understanding

436
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,170
about that little incident     
 back in my limo,

437
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,522
and i think that kind          
 of understanding               
 should be rewarded.

438
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,158
So i'd like you to have this.

439
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:36,826
It's a diamond bracelet.

440
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:40,247
It's not much, really,         
 though it does come            
 with a security guard.

441
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,153
[Scoffs]

442
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,606
[whispering intensely] 
         it's gorgeous!

443
00:21:58,449 --> 00:21:59,450
No.

444
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:03,320
Robin, you know,   
             i don't love you

445
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,290
for your money     
             or your diamonds

446
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:10,444
or the fact that you can buy   
 my friends bars.

447
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,847
I love you because i think     
 you're a very interesting man

448
00:22:15,383 --> 00:22:18,485
and i thought       
            you cared about me. 
     Oh, i'm sorry.

449
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:21,338
I'm ashamed of myself          
 for trying                     
 to buy your feelings.

450
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:23,389
I want to tell you             
 that i'm still the same man

451
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:26,243
and i still care for you       
 the same as i did before.

452
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,647
Well, by that,          
        do you mean that you

453
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:34,918
care for me, but you still 
     want to see other women?   
     Exactly.

454
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:37,521
But i should like to point out 
 that if i'd offered            
 this bracelet

455
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:41,091
to my  <i>chargee d'affaires,</i>     
<i> she would've snapped it up</i>     
<i> in a blur.</i>

456
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:43,977
I admire your standards.

457
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:47,064
You know, this definitely      
 puts you in the lead.

458
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,849
I must go.

459
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,619
Would you care to join me?

460
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,239
Did you hear that?

461
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,209
I am winning.

462
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:02,412
I'm winning.

463
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:05,214
You've got to... listen... 
     listen to me               
     for a second here.

464
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,835
Come on, you're giving up  
     something very valuable    
     and very important.

465
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:11,038
You're gonna regret this   
     the rest of your life.

466
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,205
[Gasps]

467
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,740
you're right.

468
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,010
I will take that bracelet.

469
