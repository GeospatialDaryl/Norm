1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,071
Hey, Woody,
come here a second, man.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,740
Something's really
bugging me.

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,308
Whatever it is,
I don't know

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,477
what you're talking about.

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,145
'Cause I've never
lied about anything.

7
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,714
This is Woody,
remember?

8
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,717
Company man, team player,
true blue.

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,019
You know, maybe
if you turn

10
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,420
that microscope
on yourself,

11
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,622
you might find some things
that aren't so pretty.

12
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,292
I can't work
in this atmosphere,

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,061
all this suspicion

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,396
and this constant
interrogation.

15
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,097
What do you people
want from me?

16
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,666
I didn't do anything,
all right?

17
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,634
I'm telling you,
I am innocent!

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,338
Okay, okay.

19
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,774
You remember
three months ago,

20
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,676
that day I called
in sick?
Woody...

21
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,878
Sam, shut up, it's
my turn to talk!

22
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,680
I... I was sick,

23
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,782
but a couple hours later,
I started feeling better,

24
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,284
and I could've come in
for half a day, but...

25
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,520
(crying):
instead, I stayed
home and did laundry

26
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,756
and watched Oprah 'cause
she had circus freaks on.

27
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,792
I'm so ashamed!

28
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,530
Oh, good, that
feels better.

29
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,333
I've been carrying that
around for three months.

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,767
(deep breath)

31
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,969
I was just gonna say
your tag's sticking up

32
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,172
on your sweater here.

33
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,541
Oh.

34
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,776
Well, then forget
I said anything.

35
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,880
I was just
kidding you, Sam.

36
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,349
Just kidding you.

37
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,418
I think I covered pretty well.

38
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:33,158

Well, if it isn't John
Cougar Mellonhead.

55
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,102
Thank you for last night,
Miss Tortelli.

56
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,237
I wasn't with
you last night.
I know,

57
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,139
and don't think
I don't appreciate it.

58
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,810
Oh, Sam!

59
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,112
Yes, John, what
can I do for you?

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,414
Sam, I have a
small request.

61
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,950
For the next three hours,
I need you and the rest

62
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,586
of the Cheers chimps
to hold down the noise.

63
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,521
Right now, I'm
entertaining

64
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,123
200 elderly women

65
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,791
from the Daughters of
the American Revolution.

66
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,060
Giving them a firsthand
account, John?

67
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,096
Very amusing.

68
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,332
Sam, this vent connects
directly to my dining room

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,302
and often, we can hear
everything you say down here,

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,338
<i>so tell your mailman to go
to that side of the bar</i>

71
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,308
if he wants to describe
his fungal infections.

72
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,144
You know, I have
to second that.

73
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,179
Well, sure, John.

74
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,148
Heck, you should've come down
and told us sooner.

75
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,483
We'll be happy to oblige you.

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,018
Well, thank you, Sam.

77
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,587
That's uncharacteristically
civil of you.

78
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,055
Oh!

79
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,091
If you all behave yourselves
for the next three hours,

80
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,160
maybe I'll take you out
for ice cream.

81
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,462
Would you like that?

82
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,934
Why don't you just
get lost, you sweathog.

83
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,002
Sewer rat.

84
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,537
Bag of bones.
Maggot.

85
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,476
Am I the only one
who finds him really attractive?

86
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,479
You believe that guy?
So damned condescending.

87
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,947
Ah, Sammy, not so loud.

88
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,183
He'll get angry--
we won't get the ice cream.

89
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,986
I think I'm on to something.

90
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,020
(chuckles)

91
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,855
SAM:
Yeah, yeah,
here you go.

92
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,590
(high-pitched voice):
Eek, eek!

93
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,892
Oh, there's a rat!

94
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,062
Oh, my God,
there's another big rat!

95
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,197
(numerous
running footsteps)

96
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,068
(rumbling)

97
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,402
(Sam laughing)

98
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,205
I think that
was very successful!

99
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,375
Except you got a bunch
of dust in my beer here, Sam.

100
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,911
Um, sorry, I'll get
you another one.

101
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,882
HILL:
Sam!

102
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,984
Before I spend the remainder
of the afternoon

103
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,620
trying to sort out
whose walker is whose,

104
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,789
I want to say
one thing.

105
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,525
I live for the day
when I can close this bar down

106
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,894
and put you
out on the street.

107
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,763
Eh, he doesn't
scare me.

108
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,099
You ought to see him
with just the night light on.

109
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,236
Hey, everybody.

110
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,804
Got everything
we need

111
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,206
for our marathon poker fest.

112
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,874
Yeah? Did you
bring the chips?

113
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,275
Oh, yeah, I've got, uh,

114
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,077
red ones, blue ones,
white ones...

115
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,445
No, no, no--
the chips!

116
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,781
Ranch, mesquite,
sour cream.

117
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,550
Don't you have any idea
how to play this game?

118
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,818
Yeah, I think so.

119
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,653
So, you guys having a
big poker game, huh?

120
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,921
NORM:
Yep.

121
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,790
You know, uh,
I always wanted

122
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,325
to learn how to play that game.

123
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,727
You, uh, you never
played poker there, Woody?

124
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,928
No.

125
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,964
Played all kinds
of card games in Hanover,

126
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,298
but never poker.

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,267
I was pretty good, too.

128
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,835
I'd win all the time.
Yeah?

129
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,272
Yeah, chicken in a box,
one-eyed rooster,

130
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,907
possum on a pole.

131
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,842
What kind of
games are that?

132
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,445
No, no, no, that's
what the winner got.

133
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,216
You know, guys, I
think it's time

134
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,918
Woody learned how to
play a little poker.

135
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:53,852
Yeah?
Really?

136
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Thanks a lot.

137
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,388
How can I ever
thank you guys?

138
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,025
Oh, I don't know, we'll
think of a way, Woody.

139
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,827
Say, you guys got, uh,
room for one more?

140
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,229
Uh, well, yeah, okay,
it's all right with us,

141
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,231
but I've got to warn you,
we're gonna be playing

142
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,466
into the wee smalls.

143
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,101
Uh, you might want
to check

144
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,103
with the old
"ball and Crane."

145
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,574
I don't have to ask
Lilith if I can play.

146
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,575
I'm an independent
person.

147
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,843
I can make my
own decisions.

148
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,279
It's all right
with me, Frasier.

149
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,780
I wasn't asking.

150
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,082
Regardless,
I still approve.

151
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,783
Well, approve all you
want to-- I don't care.

152
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,785
I'm gonna play poker,
stay out late.

153
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,921
Stay out all night
if you like.

154
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,988
You have
my permission.

155
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,990
Stop it.

156
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,360
Very well, Frasier.

157
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,228
Please stay home
with your wife and child.

158
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,262
We need you.

159
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,564
Forget it, woman--
gotta be me!

160
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,632
Let's party, boys.

161
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,900
NORM:
Sammy, are you in?

162
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,570
No, I gotta make sure things run
out here, you know?

163
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,338
I can't concentrate
on the game

164
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,740
and the bar
at the same time.

165
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,708
What about me?
What am I here for?

166
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,343
Oh, right--
and I have to worry

167
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,478
about Rebecca, too.

168
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,082
You know, Sam,
that really ticks me off.

169
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,951
If you don't appreciate
what I do,

170
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,152
why don't I just quit?

171
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,787
Oh, come on,
sweetheart, I...

172
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,589
I appreciate everything
you do around here.

173
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,957
Really?
Yeah.

174
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,492
What do I do?

175
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,294
Well...

176
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,498
now, come on, don't back
me in a corner like this.

177
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,235
So, it's not worth it
to have me around.

178
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,269
I'm useless,
is that it?

179
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,538
No, come on, honey,
you are real valuable

180
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,041
around here doing...

181
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,343
all the things
that you do, all right?

182
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,047
All right, fine, listen,
all right, all right.

183
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,248
If it'll make
you feel better,

184
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,683
I'll go play a little
poker, all right?

185
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,284
You can take care
of things out here.

186
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,585
Okay, don't think
that I can't.

187
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,188
I mean, I am competent.
I am damn competent.

188
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,690
You know, I mean,
I'm not just some lackey

189
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,926
who carries receipts around
in a cigar box all day long.

190
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,594
I mean, I know
what I'm doing.

191
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,896
I have a business degree.

192
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,564
And I have a lot
of experience.

193
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,535
And I am very, very,
very good at doing...

194
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,072
all the things
that I do.

195
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,340
Like what?

196
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,076
Hey, come on, don't back
me in the corner here.

197
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,787
You know, there is nothing
like a good cigar.

198
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,295
And this is nothing
like a good cigar.

199
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,131
Yeah, this blanket ought
to keep the smoke

200
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,232
away from the customers.

201
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,168
Good idea, Sammy--
more for us.

202
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,570
Guys, I've gotta be honest
with you.

203
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,338
I was just trying
to hustle you out there.

204
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,240
I do know how
to play poker.

205
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,608
And to tell you
the truth,

206
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,777
I was the best poker player
in Hanover.

207
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,012
Uh-huh.
WOODY:
Actually,

208
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,947
I was the best poker player

209
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,316
in the entire
metro Hanover area.

210
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,518
Well, uh,

211
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,420
you're in the city
now, Woody.

212
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,188
Well, I guess you
do play different

213
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,590
than a bunch of farm boys.

214
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,892
Oh, yeah.
Yes, we do.

215
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,527
Why don't you
sit down, Woodrow.

216
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,762
Oh, thanks.

217
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,163
WOODY:
Take it easy on me.

218
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,265
Okay, okay.

219
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,968
So, what sort of game would
you like to play, huh?

220
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,604
Well, how about, uh,...

221
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,373
"Five blind piglets
and one full teat?"

222
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,442
What the heck kind
of game is that?

223
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,078
That's where five city boys
lose all their money.

224
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,390
Oh, Lilith, being
in charge again

225
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,858
is so invigorating.

226
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,627
I feel great!

227
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,295
This will
really show Sam.

228
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,363
Bravo.

229
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,131
Some men still need to learn

230
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,068
that women can take on roles
traditionally held by men

231
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,969
and perform them as well
or better.

232
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,939
We live in an era of
female brain surgeons,

233
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,308
astronauts,
Supreme Court Justices.

234
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,710
And bar managers.

235
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,745
Yes.

236
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,283
Do you see the nifty way
I always keep this down?

237
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,820
It creates much more
surface area for new drinks.

238
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,054
Coming through!

239
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,826
Of course, I still
have to iron out

240
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,094
a few of the kinks.

241
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,830
Oh, hey, Rebecca,
this letter came back.

242
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,867
Oh, dear, I must have put
the wrong postage on it.

243
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,936
Uh-oh.

244
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,404
What?

245
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,708
It's a renewal for our
liquor license, and...

246
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,544
I was supposed to have
sent it in two weeks ago.

247
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,613
What are you saying?

248
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,048
We have no
liquor license?

249
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,817
Yeah.

250
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,188
Do you realize we're
serving alcohol in here?

251
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,024
I mean, they could
shut us down forever.

252
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,258
I know.

253
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,361
I'm okay, I'm okay,
I'm in charge.

254
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,562
This is a crisis,
that's right,

255
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,563
but I can handle this.

256
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,198
I will
simply call

257
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,100
the state liquor board
and I... I will tell them

258
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,969
I screwed up and I am sure
they will understand.

259
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,871
And what are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

260
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,140
Well, no one will know
if we don't say anything,

261
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,508
so you just keep
your mouth shut.

262
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,476
You are to tell no one,
do you understand? No one!

263
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,145
Gotcha.

264
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,913
Where are you going?
To tell Sam.

265
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,548
No!

266
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,916
If you tell Sam,

267
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,318
he won't even let me carry
the cigar box around!

268
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,453
I know.

269
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,722
That's why I'm
gonna tell him.

270
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,824
All right,
you evil thing.

271
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,092
What do you want?

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,794
(chortling)

273
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,129
Let's see, what do you
think would be fair?

274
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,433
Say, uh, Carla, we're supposed
to be Rebecca's friends.

275
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,734
Now, I could just
as easily say,

276
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,070
"Rebecca, I'm gonna tell Sam
unless you sleep with me."

277
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,738
Exactly!

278
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,040
So, will you?

279
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,408
LILITH:
Paul.

280
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,911
She forgot to renew
a liquor license.

281
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,480
She didn't burn down
an orphanage.

282
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,984
How's it going
out here?

283
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,019
Fine, fine!

284
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,287
I'm in charge!

285
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,321
Good, good.
Uh, you don't
even need

286
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,723
to come out here,
not even for a second.

287
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,324
I just want to get the
fellas some more beer.

288
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,326
Sam, if you need beer,
I'll bring you the beer.

289
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,761
Sam, this is your day
to relax.

290
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,162
Hey, Sammy.
REBECCA:
Paul!

291
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,465
Do you want to go
out with me tonight?

292
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,035
Just the two of us?

293
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,605
I suppose so.

294
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,707
Paul, is there something
you want to say?

295
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,943
Forget it,
I just got lucky.

296
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,946
Rebecca, come here.

297
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,881
Y-You're going out
to dinner with Paul?

298
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,816
Yes, I am.

299
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,619
You know, y-you might want to
think about computer dating.

300
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,788
Ads in the
personals.

301
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:06,392
I underst--
I'll bring you the beer.

302
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,493
CARLA:
Okay, Becks.

303
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,694
They said you just have to go

304
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,529
down to the liquor license
board in the morning

305
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,064
and they'll rubber-stamp
the renewal.

306
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,465
Oh, good.
In the meantime,

307
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,533
we just can't serve
any alcohol.
Okay,

308
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,534
we can't serve
any alcohol.

309
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,136
Fine, I can
deal with that.

310
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,638
Miss, I'd like a Scotch
and soda, please.

311
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,541
We're all out of Scotch.

312
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,842
How about a bourbon?

313
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,110
We're out
of bourbon.

314
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,478
What's that behind you?

315
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,813
I don't see
anything.

316
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,181
Right there, behind you--
all those bottles.

317
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,316
I said I don't
see anything!

318
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,751
Carla, Carla, it's all right.

319
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,422
Sir, here is
your Scotch and soda.

320
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,556
Rebecca.
It's all right.

321
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,991
I have a plan,
just watch this.

322
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,992
Here you go.

323
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,026
N-N-N-N-No.

324
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,594
I don't need
any money.

325
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,862
I want you to take this

326
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,664
and just think of it
as a gift from me--

327
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,966
Rebecca Howe,
private citizen

328
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,537
and in no way affiliated
with this bar.

329
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,506
Thanks.

330
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,742
You see that?

331
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,544
That's all we have to do,
that's the answer.

332
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,813
All we have to do is give
everybody free alcohol

333
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,348
and not take any money
for it,

334
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,850
and this bar can stay
in business forever.

335
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,753
Ow!

336
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,189
Rebecca,
let me get that for you.

337
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,523
Ow!

338
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,791
LILITH:
I'm sorry, are you all right?

339
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:13,959
Yes, just put it down.

340
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,128
Ow!
Oh!

341
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,072
Rebecca?
Yes?

342
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,174
You're taking
money for a drink?

343
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,577
I thought the plan was to
give them away for free.

344
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,711
No, see, I realized

345
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,146
we couldn't really afford
to do that

346
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,615
about $1,200 ago,

347
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,018
so now what we're doing
is tricking them.

348
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,719
You see, Carla and I
have taken all the bottles

349
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,854
and put colored water
in them,

350
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,489
and we're serving
non-alcoholic beer

351
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,691
Aha.
and soft drinks.

352
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,826
Can I have a strawberry
daiquiri, miss?

353
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,261
Oh, yes, coming
right up.

354
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,031
Kool-Aid on
crushed ice.

355
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,099
Hey, Rebecca.

356
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,634
Hi, Sam.

357
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,969
I came for some more
beers for the guys.

358
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,203
They're going through
it like it's water.

359
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,571
Well, it's not.

360
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,476
You, you sure everything
is going all right?

361
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:05,511
Yes, you'll get your beer.

362
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,413
Just get back in there,
go on.

363
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,414
All right.

364
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,718
This is very interesting,
Rebecca.

365
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,020
Allow me to help
in your little charade.

366
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,589
(loudly):
I'd like a Scotch, please.

367
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,359
(in normal voice):
I've done some acting
in my time.

368
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,564
Thank you.

369
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:33,138
Whoa!

370
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,940
(coughs)

371
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,742
Smooth!

372
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,446
That was very good,
Lilith.

373
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,749
You really have
a mischievous side to you.

374
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,751
<i>I was The Bad Seed
in high school.</i>

375
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,519
Whoa, scary play.

376
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,255
<i>Oh, that's right, it was a play.</i>

377
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,826
Excuse me, miss.

378
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,594
My rum and Coke here tastes

379
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,896
an awful lot
like Coke and coffee.

380
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,667
Oh, let me
smell that.

381
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,304
Oh... that rum smells
pretty strong to me.

382
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,039
Hey, you know...

383
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,843
when you can't smell
or taste the alcohol,

384
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,511
that's a sign that
you might be having

385
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,113
a little
drinking problem.

386
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,280
Excuse me?

387
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,949
I think you ought
to get some help.

388
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,785
In the meantime, how about
another rum and Coke?

389
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,854
We just put up
a fresh pot.

390
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,089
Forget it.

391
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,024
Look, everybody
is leaving.

392
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,725
So?

393
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,961
So, if Sam finds out, th-then
he'll know something's wrong.

394
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,829
Come on, get those guys,
get them back here.

395
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,164
Uh, excuse me, sir.

396
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,234
Can I talk to
you a minute?

397
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,636
(Carla speaking
quietly)

398
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,942
(indistinct chatter)

399
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,844
Wow, what did
you say to them?

400
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,613
Oh, I just told them
that in a few minutes

401
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:48,847
you're going to
take off your clothes

402
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,350
and dance on the tables in
just your bra and panties.

403
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,454
Good thinking.

404
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,389
You sure everything's okay
back here?
Oh!

405
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,324
Yeah, ev-everything's,
everything's just fine.

406
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,727
Come on, baby,
show us your stuff.

407
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,928
What-What's that?

408
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,329
What are they, what
are they saying?

409
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,497
Oh, it's, it's nothing.

410
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,667
I just have some stuff
and... they want to see it.

411
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,136
Now go on back in there,
come on.

412
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,738
We're just about ready
to get that beer for you.

413
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,973
Go on, there's more beer
on its way.

414
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,742
All right,
all right.

415
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,244
Carla, take some non-alcoholic
beer back there to those guys.

416
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,446
I thought you were going
to do that.

417
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,748
I have a show to do.

418
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,062
Here you go, guys.

419
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,630
It's your fifth round.

420
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,399
Hope you can handle it.

421
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,368
What does
that mean, Carla?

422
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,003
Nothing.

423
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,771
Wait a minute,
what did you put in the beer?

424
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,039
Nothing.

425
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,743
You know,

426
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,845
fellas, normally
I'm a great believer

427
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,113
in responsible drinking,

428
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,915
but, uh, boy, this stuff
really goes down easy.

429
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,350
(chuckles)

430
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,886
And besides, Ma knows I'm out
with the boys tonight, you know.

431
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,222
If I don't come home
with a little glow on,

432
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,190
she'll tease me
till I cry.

433
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,496
All right, I call.

434
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,564
I got you this time,
fellas, read 'em and weep,

435
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,832
Aces over tens.

436
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,367
(all groan)

437
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,435
FRASIER:
Ay, yi-yi.

438
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,803
WOODY:
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Sam,

439
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,940
uh, I got a couple of pairs--
eights and threes.

440
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:26,478
Woody, aces and tens
beat eights and threes.

441
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,014
Oh, I'm sorry,
here's one more three.

442
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,750
Full house-- (screams)

443
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,386
(laughing)

444
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,954
I know
I'm the only one laughing,

445
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,123
but believe me,
it's really funny.

446
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,494
Woody, your obnoxious,
gloating behavior

447
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,463
is not making you
any friends.

448
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,466
<i>Well, boo-hoo, Dr. Crane,
I can buy new friends.</i>

449
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,436
All right, deal the cards,
come on, let's deal the cards.

450
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,603
Wait a minute.

451
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,773
I was looking for the queen
of spades here and...

452
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,642
there is no queen of spades
in this deck.

453
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,910
I'm gonna count
these cards.
Go ahead.

454
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,546
Hey, guys, is
it me or is...

455
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,049
(laughing):
...or is this beer great?

456
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,485
Boy, well, you know, I--

457
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,520
maybe I should just
hold off here, I...

458
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,023
I, for one, am getting
a little buzz on,

459
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,791
I'm here to tell you.

460
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,026
Hey, uh, guys,

461
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,260
listen.

462
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,329
I-I love you guys.

463
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,299
I told you hours ago--
don't touch me.

464
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,237
As I suspected, there are
only 51 cards in this deck.

465
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,305
Oh, for cryin'...

466
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,539
All right, let's look
for the other one.

467
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,707
Yeah, you bet we're
gonna look for it

468
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,842
and we're gonna
find it, too,

469
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,011
or my name is not
Clifford C. Clavin.

470
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,312
Come on, take it easy.

471
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,947
You've had a little too much,
haven't you?

472
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,148
Well, you relax,
buddy boy.

473
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,583
One of us
is cheating

474
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,852
and one of us is not
getting out of here alive.

475
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,122
Here it is, it's
under Sammy's chair.

476
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh, Sammy, Sammy, look...

477
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,193
if you needed the money,
why didn't you just ask me?

478
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,296
No one's accusing anyone
of cheating.

479
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,731
We just have
to replay the last hand.

480
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,966
Go ahead
and deal them out there, Phil.

481
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,336
You want
to hurry it up there, Phil?

482
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,705
I got to get up early and pack
for my weekend in Nantucket.

483
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,206
Hmm, a little
pleasure trip, huh?

484
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:05,344
No, Lilith's coming.

485
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,546
Five-card showdown,
fellas.

486
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,847
All right.

487
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,750
FRASIER:
Uh, check.

488
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,118
Uh, check.

489
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,854
Ah!

490
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,589
Oh, man, I'm out.
I'm out.

491
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,192
NORM:
Oh, Woody,
for crying out loud.

492
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,061
I'll call.

493
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,063
Three aces.

494
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,731
(laughing)

495
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,200
Read 'em and weep there,
buddy boy.

496
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:33,472
Cliff, y-you got five
unmatched cards there.

497
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,074
CLIFF:
That's right.

498
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,242
And, uh, you guys probably
thought I was bluffing, huh?

499
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,478
Come to Papa.

500
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,889
(yawning):
Oh, boy.

501
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:54,360
I am so glad
this night is almost over.

502
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,930
I am just wiped out.

503
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,199
You know, Rebecca, you've
been through a lot tonight.

504
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,067
I was thinking maybe I
took advantage of you

505
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,535
when I asked
you out.

506
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:07,006
Ever since my wife left me,
I've been sort of desperate

507
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,375
for female companionship,
you know.

508
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,943
I always say
the wrong thing.

509
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,845
So what it boils
down to is this--

510
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:17,383
if, if, if you'd rather not go
out with me, I'd understand.

511
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,717
That's sweet, Paul.

512
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,788
I'd be delighted
to go out with you tonight.

513
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:25,457
Bring your toothbrush.

514
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,726
(groans)

515
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,261
Everything okay?

516
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,864
Would you quit coming in here
every five seconds

517
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,766
and asking me
if everything's okay?

518
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,034
What is it going to take

519
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,436
before you believe
that everything is just fine?

520
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,671
(door opens)

521
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,738
State Liquor Board.

522
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,440
Nobody move,
this is a raid.

523
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:42,975
What the hell's
going on here?

524
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,410
I'll handle this,
I'm the manager.

525
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,945
We understand you're serving
liquor here without a license.

526
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,113
Who owns this bar?

527
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,849
He does.

528
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,951
What the hell's
going on here?

529
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,620
Mercy me.

530
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,555
What is going on here?

531
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:57,556
A raid?

532
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,992
Say it isn't so.

533
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,227
Will someone
please tell me

534
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,263
what the hell is
going on around here?

535
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,165
I'll tell you, Sam.

536
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,533
A little vent told me

537
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,302
your manager let
your liquor license expire.

538
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,571
Yes, but w-we did not serve
one drop of liquor here

539
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,739
all night long,

540
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:16,208
a-a-and you guys can check
any glass here.

541
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,079
It's clean.

542
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,180
REBECCA:
You see?

543
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,781
I saved the day.

544
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,783
You saved the day?!

545
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,418
You wouldn't have had
to save the day

546
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,654
if you hadn't have screwed it up
in the first place.

547
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,189
Come on, what were
you thinking?

548
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,256
How could you do that?

549
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,658
How could you forget
something like that?

550
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,526
You know
that could have cost me my bar?

551
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,362
I mean, what have you got--
rocks in your head?

552
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,863
You know, I mean, I
did mail the thing in.

553
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,365
It's just that
it came back.

554
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,033
I think there was just
something wrong with the stamp.

555
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,502
There's nothing wrong
with the stamp, you moron.

556
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,837
It's for 25 cents.

557
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,505
I put it on myself.

558
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:47,606
AGENT:
Postage is

559
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,274
29 cents.

560
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,144
Oh.

561
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:53,779
Well, I'm out of here.

562
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,115
Why don't you go ahead
and, uh, close up?

563
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,349
After all, you
are the manager.

564
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,851
REBECCA:
No, hold it
a second.

565
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,186
You're the one that screwed up.

566
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:02,821
I-I'm the one
that saved this bar.

567
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,790
So, I mean,
who is the moron now?

568
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,726
You're the one who put
the stamp on this letter

569
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,229
while I've been scrambling
around this bar tonight

570
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,565
trying to save it
without breaking one law.

571
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:17,503
That's right, I did that--
me, Rebecca, the moron.

572
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,072
REBECCA:
Well, things are going
to change around here.

573
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,575
From now on, I want a little
respect around this place.

574
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:24,810
You got that?

575
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:26,412
All right.

576
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:30,683
Because, from this day forward,
I will hold my head up high,

577
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,218
because I am Rebecca Howe.

578
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:36,488
I am the manager of Cheers.

579
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,465
That's, that's why we
always keep the flap up.
