          What's going on there?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,700
There appears to be a man       
lying in the street.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,100
    Oh, my God, it's Woody!     
Woody.

  a doctor coming.              

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,500
Are you                         
all right?

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,800
Hey, Carla, you'll never believe
          what I found          

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,500
     in the storage closet.     

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,100
This great old foosball table.  

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
        (screams)               

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,400
          Yeah, I was           
      pretty excited, too.      

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,700
  This foosball table is evil.  

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
          It's cursed.          

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,500
What are you talking about?     

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,900
    One day, it mysteriously    
appeared in the alley out back. 

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
From the moment we started      
          to play it,           

40
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,700
    this place turned           
    from a nice local tavern    

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
      into a seething pit       
of resentment and backstabbing. 

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,700
    Oh... so that's             
    how it happened.            

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,300
I'm telling you, things got ugly
          around here.          

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
One time,                       

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,000
        the ball flew out and   
        hit Clavin in the eye   

46
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,700
                  for no earthly
                         reason.

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,000
                     (laughing):
                It was funny.   

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
              But it was spooky.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,900
That's when                     
I realized                      

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,700
                    that this   

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
is an evil foosball table.      

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
            Well, why didn't you
                  get rid of it?

53
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, we tried to throw it away,

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
                but the trashman
                who picked it up

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,600
                slipped and fell
          backward into traffic.

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,200
    I'll never forget           
    his last words...           

57
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,200
         "What the...?"         

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,700
Well, it's, it's not exactly    
"The Telltale Heart," but...    

59
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,200
it's a pretty good story.       

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
                Gee, Carla, I   
                    had no idea.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,900
                     I'll put it
                     right back.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,700
                Hey, Cliffie!   
                Huh?            

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,800
                  Check it out--
                 the foos table.

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
                  Too late.     

65
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,800
            It has risen from   
            its resting place   

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,700
                to feed upon the
            fat and middle-aged.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,300
            Uh, Sam.            

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,500
         Oh, hey, John,         
how very nice to see you again. 

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,200
You're lying, aren't you?       

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,700
        Yes, I am.              

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,500
Mr. Hill, I just had lunch      
     up at your restaurant      

72
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,400
        and the risotto with bay
        scallops and fennel--   

73
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,300
          oh, I think it was the
                  most delicious

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
thing I've ever had             
to eat.                         

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,900
We'll name it for you.          

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,200
                    Thank you.  

77
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,000
        Hey, come here.         

78
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,300
                          I hate
                    this guy.   

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,100
          What are you, what are
      you kissing up to him for?

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not kissing up, Sam,        
I like the food.                

81
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,300
Sam, you don't have             
to be jealous.                  

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,700
You are a very                  
handsome businessman,           

83
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,000
and you own the                 
hottest spot in town.           

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
                Oh, oh, thank   
                  you very much.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,100
 <i>That's</i> kissing up.             

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,000
Sam, I think we both know       
         why I'm here.          

87
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,800
    I bet you want the number   
to my hairstylist. Don't you?   

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,700
         Oh, I'm sorry.         

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
      Now, that was cruel.      

90
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,000
Sam, as we both know,           

91
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,800
I own legal title to your       
poolroom and both bathrooms.    
                            Hey,

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 why do you keep repeating that 
 every time you come down here? 

93
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,500
 You're driving me up the wall. 

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,700
        That's why.             

95
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,300
Now where was I?                

96
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh, yes, as you know, I own     
legal title to your poolroom    

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
and both bathrooms,             

98
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,900
and rent on said property is    
past due since last Wednesday.  

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
I hope you haven't              
forgotten me, Sam.              

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
                  Forgotten you?

101
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,200
John, I could never forget you. 

102
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,400
    You're in my bad dreams     
          every night.          

103
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,900
    You're the reason           
    why I'm in therapy          

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
 for the first time in my life. 

105
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,700
Well,                           
don't forget                    

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
to mention to your therapist    
that I own legal title to y...  

107
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,900
                      All right,

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
     all right, all right,      
        all right.              

109
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,000
         I'll write you         
    your stupid check.          

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
         Sam, I'm a little hurt.

111
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,500
            If you felt the need
             to see a therapist,

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,500
                  why didn't you
                     come to me?

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,700
     Oh...                      

114
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
      Well, I-- you know,       
    I was looking, sort of,     

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
    for a doctor that,          
    you know, didn't know me    

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,700
so well,                        

117
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,600
    who has, uh, blonde hair    
         and smoky eyes         

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,000
and wears miniskirts and crosses
     her legs all the time.     

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
              Oh.               

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Connie Forsythe, a fine doctor. 

121
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah.                           

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,200
        (chuckles)              

123
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
She'll straighten you out.      

124
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,000
          Oh, she did.          

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,100
Here's my personal check.       

126
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
              You'll notice that
                I made it out to

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
      John "You Stink" Hill.    

128
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Sam, this is not up             
to your usual standards.        

129
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,100
         (blows raspberry)      

130
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
        Now it is.              

131
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,700
 Man, I can never get the guy.  

132
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,600
     I hate him. Just once      
  I would like to do something  

133
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,100
that gets under his skin.       

134
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,500
  Sam, forget him, he's gone.   
No, he's                        

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,100
        not gone,               
  there's no escaping the guy.  

136
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
            I mean,             
  I-I walk down my own hallway  

137
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,600
and I know that I'm on his turf.

138
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,300
  I can't even go to the damn   
 bathroom without getting mad.  

139
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,600
    Oh, you, too, Sammy?        

140
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
You know something?             

141
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,400
I'm out of here.                

142
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm gonna go see                
Dr. Forsythe.                   

143
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,500
I got to get this               
out of my system.               

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,900
            You're going to talk
                to her about it?

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
      No, I'm gonna get it      
    out of my system. Talk?     

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
                Excuse me.      

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
                     Are you Mr.
                         Malone?
             Yeah.              

148
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,800
    Well, there seems to be a   
        problem with this check.

149
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,700
Oh, what? I just                
made a joke name up.            

150
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,900
    Big deal.                   

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,900
All he has to do                
is make sure he endorses it     

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,100
John "I Stink" Hill.            

153
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,200
         (laughs)               

154
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,700
        No, Mr. Malone,         
 you made it out for too much.  

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
                    You added an
                     extra zero.

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
        Wow.                    

157
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, well, thank you             
very much, it's...              

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,200
        I'm kind of surprised   
          someone as nice as you

159
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,600
                  works for that
            bald-headed jackass.

160
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,600
Oh, I don't work for him.       

161
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm the bald-headed             
jackass' daughter,              

162
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,600
Valerie "You Stink" Hill.       

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
                  I'm sorry.    

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
            I-I-I never intended
          for anyone to see that

165
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,800
                 except John.   

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
And all the people at the bank. 

167
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,100
                 Well, yeah.    

168
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,700
                  I'll write you
                  another check.

169
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,200
Valerie, what are you doing     
down here?                      

170
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,000
          I asked you           
    never to come down here.    

171
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,600
I just wanted to get            
the right amount on the check.  

172
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Well, I was perfectly pleased   
     with the amount as written.

173
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
                Besides, I don't
            want you associating

174
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,900
with the element                
that hangs around               

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,800
                    in this bar.
                Wipe your hands.

176
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,800
        Thank you.              

177
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,500
                Sam, I heard you
                  say you wanted

178
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,100
                    to get under
                Mr. Hill's skin.

179
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,800
        Yeah.                   

180
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
              Well, I got a way,

181
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,700
                  but... I think
                it's impossible.

182
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
You're thinking that maybe      
I should date his daughter?     

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
     (laughs)                   

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
          Great idea!           

185
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,700
 No, no, no, if you really want 
 to get under Mr. Hill's skin,  

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,900
the best way is we shrink you   
down to microscopic size        

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
and then we put you             
in a syringe                    

188
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
and we inject you               
right into his arm.             

189
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,600
But I still say                 
it's impossible.                

190
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
                Oh, I love this.

191
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,700
        This is a great idea.   

192
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,900
                      Oh, great.

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
      Now I got Sam trying      
         to contradict          

194
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,200
 the immutable laws of science. 

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,200
    When am I going to learn    
     to keep my mouth shut?     

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,900
     (elegant music plays)      

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,300
        You know, Sam, I have to
              confess I've never
                 really been out

198
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
                 with a guy like
                     you before.

199
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,300
              I'm afraid I don't
        even know how to act.   

200
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,800
Ah, well,                       
it's really easy.               

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,400
Shimmy over here                
a little bit, will you?         

202
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,400
There you go.                   

203
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,800
Now... first off,               
just, you know,                 

204
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,400
adjust your, uh,                
outfit a little bit there.      

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,500
Very good.                      

206
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,100
Laugh like hell                 
at everything I say             

207
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
and, oh, yeah,                  
put your hand in my lap.        

208
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,800
                  (laughs)      

209
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,000
          (chuckling):          
  No, th-that was not a joke.   

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,500
    Sam, I really feel like I   
  don't know what to say to you.

211
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,500
Well, it doesn't                
really matter, sweetheart,      

212
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
    it's just...                

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
All you got to do               
is make sure you whisper it     

214
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
right here,                     
right in my neck.               

215
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Yeah, there you go.             
Oh, hi, John!                   

216
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,400
(laughs)                        

217
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,500
Boy, I didn't expect            
to see you here tonight.        

218
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,800
 Sam, I see you've made friends 
    with my daughter.           

219
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh, yes, we're very good        
friends by now, John.           

220
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,900
I've discovered how her eyes    
dance in the light,             

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,300
how neat her hair smells,       
how soft her skin feels.        

222
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,900
Modesty prevents me             
from going on.                  

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
        Fine, I'll send         

224
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,700
          the wine steward over.

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,400
        Sam, I liked what you   
             said about my eyes,

226
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,800
                but you know I'm
            wearing contacts.   

227
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,100
        Hmm?                    

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh, yeah, yeah,                 
I know.                         

229
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,400
I saw them swimming around      
in there earlier.               

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Here, here, o-open up.          

231
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Hey, John, look at this.        

232
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,800
Your daughter and I             
are sharing food together.      

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
I hope                          
I'm not interrupting,           

234
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
but has anybody told you about  
the specials for tonight?       

235
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,300
 Oh, it doesn't really matter,  
  John. We're just gonna have   

236
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,700
a ton of raw oysters            
and then dash out of            
here all out of breath.         

237
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,500
The oysters are delicious.      

238
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,000
What the hell kind              
of father is he?                

239
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,300
Here I am, smelling your hair,  
talking oysters.                

240
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,500
I mean, I could be the          
biggest creep in the world.     

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,500
I could be taking you out       
for all the wrong reasons.      

242
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,100
                Are you, Sam?   
No, of course not.              

243
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,600
Here, jump in my lap.           

244
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
             There you go.      

245
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Sam, I'm not sure               
I feel comfortable              

246
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,800
sitting in your lap             
like this.                      

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,500
            Hmm? Oh. How's that?

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,100
     Oh, I like that.           

249
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,900
Uh, Sam, I wonder if I could    
speak with you for a moment?    

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
            Well, sure, John.   

251
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,600
              Will you excuse me
          for a minute, Valerie?

252
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,400
Oh, do I have to move?          

253
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
         Usually, but, uh, we'll
          talk about that later.

254
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,800
Yes, John?                      

255
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,600
                      Sam, I was
              thinking if you're

256
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,100
      considering dessert,      
     I'd like to recommend      

257
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,300
the Grand Marnier soufflé       
            for two.            

258
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
                      It's quite
                        elegant.

259
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,100
    The only thing is,          
      you have to order it      

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,500
at least a half an hour ahead...

261
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, please, don't take her away 
         from me, Sam.          

262
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,000
    She's the only daughter     
         I've ever had.         

263
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,000
            Please, Sam, please.

264
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Oh, John, I-I was just          
taking her out to annoy you.    

265
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,300
I had no idea it would cause    
such genuine pain.              

266
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
          I'll give you anything
                  you want, Sam.

267
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,900
                You want your   
                        poolroom

268
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,000
              and both bathrooms
                rent-free, fine.

269
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,700
          Just promise me you'll
        never see Valerie again.

270
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Oh, John, what kind of guy      
do you think I am?              

271
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,300
I mean,                         
how can I go along              

272
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,500
with a sleazy arrangement       
like that? Oh, boy, oh, boy.    

273
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,900
        I'll give you my parking
        space for your Corvette.

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,900
          Deal.                 

275
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,600
  I'm telling you guys,         
  it was beautiful.             

276
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,600
                        Yeah?   

277
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,300
     I now have my poolroom     

278
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,700
  and my bathrooms rent-free,   

279
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,500
        but better yet,         
    I had the guy in tears.     

280
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
  Look at that--                
  I got some of them            

281
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
  right there                   
  on the napkin.                

282
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,600
                      Very nice.
            Now, what are you   

283
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,200
    gonna do about the date     
         with the girl?         

284
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,400
      What?                     

285
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,800
Oh, thank you, ooh.             

286
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
          (laughing):           
        I forgot.               

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
         Sam,                   

288
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
I finished                      
all the oysters                 

289
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,700
and I'm feeling                 
kind of funny.                  

290
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,600
  What do you want to do now?   

291
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
         Actually, Val,         
     I'm kind of busy here.     

292
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,400
 Uh, a problem's just come up.  

293
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,500
         Uh, something          
      with the kegs here.       

294
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,700
     The kegs are leaking.      

295
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
                      What?!    

296
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
He's feeding her                
a line, stupid.                 

297
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,000
      Well, you don't joke about
    that kind of thing, ever.   

298
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,000
VALERIE:                        
Well...                         

299
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,800
maybe when                      
you're through here             

300
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
we can go for a drive.          

301
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
            Oh, I don't know.   

302
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,500
              Uh, these kegs are
         a never-ending problem.

303
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,300
         I'm thinking of getting
          rid of them, actually.

304
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,800
          Hey, I don't find this
            kind of thing funny.

305
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
            Okay, maybe it's me.

306
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,500
Well, maybe we can              
do it another time.             

307
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Uh... I don't, I don't think so.

308
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,200
      I-I don't think things are
        working out, Valerie.   

309
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,100
        All right.              

310
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
    Was it something I did?     

311
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,300
          Oh, no, no-no, no, no.

312
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,600
    Uh, you know, some things   
    work out, some things don't.

313
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,000
    This is one of those that   
        just didn't work out.   

314
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,500
        Oh. Okay.               

315
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,200
        Well, bye.              

316
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,200
              Bye.              

317
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
        (snaps fingers)         

318
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,500
  I tell you, man, this is the  
  best deal I've ever scammed.  

319
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
    I get my poolroom           

320
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,700
  and my bathrooms rent-free,   
      and all I had to do       

321
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,600
  was throw a little fish back  
     I didn't want anyway.      

322
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,800
                CLIFF: Yeah, way
                to go, Sammy.   

323
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,800
      You want to, uh, go       

324
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
        shoot some stick        
    in <i>your</i> poolroom?           

325
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,300
     No, I don't think so.      

326
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,300
  Well, how'd you like to wash  
        your hands, Sam,        

327
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,100
    in <i>your</i> bathroom?           

328
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
            No, no.             

329
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,700
     What <i>do</i> you want Sam?      

330
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
 I want that little fish back.  

331
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,600
                            Yes!
          Oh, we're tied!       

332
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,100
        We're tied!             
                      (shouting)

333
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
        Carla, give us the ball.

334
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,300
    No, this is an evil game    
     and it brings a curse      

335
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,700
    on anyone who plays it.     

336
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,300
        I'm just trying         
    to save you guys.           

337
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,500
             Oh, come on, Carla.

338
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,900
            It's just a harmless
                  foosball game.

339
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,300
          We're just having fun.

340
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,800
                  So look, here,
            you drop the ball   

341
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,100
     so I can tear the heads off
         these pasty-faced geeks

342
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
                 and drink their
                warm, red blood!

343
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,700
                Did my head just
         turn completely around?

344
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,000
                Or was that just
        a trick of the light?   

345
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
        I can't believe I traded
              her for bathrooms.

346
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,400
Sam, give me a break.           

347
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,000
The only reason you're          
interested in that girl         

348
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,600
is because you can't have her.  

349
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
It was the same thing with me.  

350
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
You wanted her,                 
too, Miss Howe?                 

351
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,700
  Boy, I've been in this city   
      one month too long.       

352
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,900
      No, no...                 

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
                        Woody...

354
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
he wanted me because            
he couldn't have me.            

355
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,800
You know, Sam,                  

356
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,700
if I told you right now         
you could have me,              

357
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,200
I bet you wouldn't              
even be interested.             

358
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,200
                 Maybe, but I'd,
            uh, still perform   

359
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,800
      'cause I'm a professional.

360
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,500
                  So, uh, Sammy.

361
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
                 What is it now?
          What are you gonna do?

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,900
I'm gonna see her again.        
                        FRASIER:
                            Sam,

363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
if you do that, you may         
end up having to pay rent       

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,700
again on the poolroom           
and on the bathrooms.           

365
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,000
          Why is that?          

366
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,800
Well, if you take an action,    

367
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
you'll have to face             
the consequences.               

368
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,000
          No, I don't.          
        I'm Sammy.              

369
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
      Where have you been       
        all these years?        

370
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh, right.                      

371
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
I forgot, you're                
Nietzsche's Superman.           

372
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,700
                          CLIFF:
                    Oh, yeah.   

373
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,300
                 Is that the one
        with the craggy face,   

374
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
         uh, looks like granite?

375
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,900
        No. No-no,              
 that's, uh, Bizarro Superman.  

376
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,300
      Oh, wait, which one       
was weakened by red Kryptonite? 

377
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
                  Blue Superman.

378
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,400
     I thought he was black     
and he wore the big hats.       

379
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,900
     No, that's Super Fly.      

380
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,600
  Woody, come over here, man.   

381
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,100
  I want you to run a note up   
    to Valerie for me.          

382
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
"I'm sorry for everything.      

383
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,600
"Would you please go away       
with me this weekend?           

384
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
I can't stop thinking           
of you. Sam."                   

385
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,500
Take it upstairs.               

386
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,600
Just make sure her father       
doesn't get this, all right?    

387
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,500
                  No sweat, Sam.

388
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
You know, back in Hanover,      

389
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
    I was the official town     
          go-between.           

390
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,200
     Anytime anybody needed     
     a love note delivered,     

391
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,800
they'd call on Woody Boyd.      

392
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,700
It got to where all I had       
to do was knock on a door,      

393
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,900
    my butt was filled          
         with birdshot.         

394
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,700
                      All right,
                 I got the ball.

395
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,500
All right.                      
                 Foos 'em if you
            got 'em, come on.   

396
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,700
                    Let's go!   
     Fools!                     

397
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
         Nonbelievers!          

398
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,500
  Can't you see what this evil  
    machine has done?           

399
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
     Look, you're trapped!      

400
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,600
  You're spending every minute  
of every day in this bar.       

401
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
    We always do that.          

402
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,200
 Yeah, but now you're doing it  
          standing up.          

403
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,100
NORM:                           
Ooh,                            

404
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,100
     that is kind of eerie.     

405
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,900
FRASIER:                        
Oh, Carla!                      

406
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,900
     This machine does not      
    have a demonic capacity!    

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
        Even if it did,         
    what could it do to you?    

408
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
  It's got a tiny little ball.  

409
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,500
            It's got these-these
             little plastic men.

410
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,200
    Or do you suppose that if   
you, you stick your hand here   

411
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
                  into the goal,
          it'll bite it off? Ow!

412
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,500
        (screams)               

413
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,000
         (men laughing)         

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
                         See?   

415
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,600
                I'm just playing
          on your superstitions.

416
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,600
     Hey. Hey, my hand's caught.

417
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,800
     (Norm and Cliff laugh)     

418
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,100
                    No, no, it's
                  really caught.

419
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,300
    I know, that's why          
        we're laughing.         

420
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,200
        Oh, good, Woody, did you
         deliver the note there?

421
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
  Uh, yeah. Well, I-I couldn't  
        find Miss Hill,         

422
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
    so I waited around          
      a while and ended up      

423
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
    leaving it with Reuben,     
          the busboy.           

424
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
          Oh, good, thanks, man.

425
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
 Yeah, he's-he's really looking 
    forward to the weekend.     

426
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,700
        He wants to know        
      what he should wear.      

427
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,300
            Woody, Woody, didn't
                 you tell Reuben

428
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
  that the note was for Valerie?

429
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,800
            Oh, Sam,            
    I didn't have the heart.    

430
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,100
        He was so happy.        

431
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,800
     He was walking on air.     

432
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,500
     Sam, this isn't fair.      

433
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
         It's one thing         
      to string me along,       

434
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,800
    but our busboy, Reuben,     
 is in a very vulnerable state. 

435
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
        He just split up        
     with the pastry chef.      

436
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,500
    No, Valerie! Wait!          

437
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,700
                      Val, wait!

438
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
  That note wasn't for Reuben.  

439
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,000
     That note was for you.     

440
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,700
I don't understand.             

441
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,100
You just brushed me off.        

442
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
          Oh, no, no, that was--

443
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,900
            I just had a problem
            with the kegs there.

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
              Did that seem like
             a brush-off to you?

445
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,500
                      I'm sorry.
        See, I wouldn't know.   

446
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
              I've never brushed
              anyone off before.

447
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,900
                        (scoffs)

448
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,400
              Listen, I-I really
                 like you a lot,

449
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,800
  and I'd like to see you again.

450
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,000
  You know, maybe we could go up
      to the Cape for a weekend.

451
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,200
    What do you say? I hear it's
        really nice up there.   

452
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
                I wouldn't know.
I've never been there myself.   

453
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,100
                        (scoffs)

454
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,100
        What do you say?        

455
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,500
        Gee, it sounds like fun.

456
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
      Good. All right, uh,      
         just make sure         

457
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,500
         you don't tell         
    your father, all right?     

458
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,000
                      Good idea.

459
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
            You know, you may   
            not believe this,   

460
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,900
      but I get the feeling he'd
        rather I didn't see you.

461
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,700
Oh, well, that's not the        
problem, really. It's just that 

462
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,600
I don't like to do my           
romantic stuff in public.       

463
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,900
                I don't know,   
          you seemed so forward.

464
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,700
              You had me sitting
     on your lap and everything.

465
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
        I'm sorry.              
     Did that seem forward?     

466
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,000
I wouldn't know. I've never done
anything like that before.      

467
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,000
        (scoffs)                
            (scoffs)            
                        (scoffs)

468
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,100
         What's wrong with them?

469
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
         Oh, uh, well,          
  the blonde has bad sinuses.   

470
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,400
        The rest of them        
    just have bad attitudes!    

471
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,500
            I feel so stupid.   

472
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,200
         I can't believe my hand
is stuck in this stupid hole.   

473
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,500
    Breathe easy, Doc.          

474
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,100
I brought an expert to help you.

475
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,900
             Great!             

476
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,900
CARLA:                          
Okay, Father.                   

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,700
         Get out your holy water

478
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,700
        and cast Satan from that
            foosball machine.   

479
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,400
      Carla, I didn't come      
    to perform an exorcism.     

480
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,800
I came because you told me      
that-that you had a friend      

481
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,500
who was thinking of converting. 

482
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
            Oh, he will, Father.

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,900
                Go with me on   
                 this one, Fras.

484
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,100
                      But first,
            you have to exorcise

485
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,300
            this foosball table.

486
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
     Carla, it may surprise     
          you to learn          

487
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,400
    that since Vatican Two,     
the church does not accept      

488
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,100
        the existence of        
     Satanically-possessed      

489
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,000
      amusement machines.       

490
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,000
        First you dump Latin,   
                and now this.   

491
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
              What do we pay you
            guys for, anyway?   

492
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
Well, I know                    

493
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,100
      exactly what to do.       

494
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,400
    You relax and put           
    your faith in me.           

495
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
  You do trust me, don't you?   

496
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,800
      Absolutely, Father.       

497
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,000
             Good!              

498
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,300
        (screams)               

499
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,800
            (moans)             

500
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,300
        My thumb!               

501
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,300
    Offer the pain up to God    
  for the poor souls, my son.   

502
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,600
             What?!             

503
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
                I think you just
            lost one, Father.   

504
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
        Boy, it was hard        
     sneaking out of there,     

505
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
but I don't think he saw me.    

506
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,800
      Good. So you're sure, now,
    your father doesn't know?   

507
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,100
      Oh, Dad stepped out.      

508
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,500
I meant Reuben the busboy.      

509
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
      He's still in tears.      

510
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,500
              You know, I really
            feel bad about that.

511
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,800
                  Maybe I should
             send him something.

512
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,100
Why don't we just get up        
to the car here, all right?     

513
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,500
        Sam, I'd like to freshen
             up before we leave.

514
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,800
Oh, well, all right.            
I'll meet you up at the car.    

515
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,200
                     Uh, Sam.   
      Yeah?                     

516
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,500
         I like the way         
     your hair smells, too.     

517
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
         Oh, thank you.         

518
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,800
    She's really nice,          
    isn't she, Woody?           

519
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,200
          Oh, she's really nice.

520
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,400
              And sweet and warm
                  and wonderful.

521
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,700
             Yeah?              
                        Yeah.   

522
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,900
                Back in Hanover,

523
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,700
    me and my brother           
      used to have a name       

524
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,500
     for a girl like that.      
Yeah, what's that?              

525
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
                    Mom.        

526
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
                By the way, Sam,
             if I ever catch you

527
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
        anywhere near my mother,
            you'd better pray   

528
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,000
 that God takes you before I do.

529
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,600
            Oh, Sam.            

530
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,500
        I've written up         
    a new agreement stating     

531
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
that since you've agreed        
to never see my daughter again, 

532
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,900
you now have full use           
of the poolroom...              

533
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
That's funny,                   
that looks just like            

534
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
my daughter's suitcase.         

535
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,900
                No, that's mine.

536
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
          You know what they say
                 at the airport:

537
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,600
      "Many bags do look alike."

538
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,100
Isn't that                      
her monogram: V.H.?             

539
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
    Uh, actually I think it used
         to belong to Van Halen.

540
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,300
Sam, indulge me.                

541
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
You're telling me               
this is your suitcase,          

542
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,600
so by extension,                
would this be your negligee?    

543
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,300
                      All right,
            the secret's out.   

544
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,100
    I'm a transvestite, John.   

545
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,900
    And a size seven?           

546
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,700
      A guy can dream, can't he?

547
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,100
Sam, you are not                
a transvestite.                 

548
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,300
      Hey, hey, those are       
    fighting words there...     

549
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
                          Daddy?

550
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,300
     Daddy, you may as well     
        know the truth.         

551
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,900
    I'm going away with Sam     
  to the Cape for the weekend.  

552
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,400
             I see.             

553
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
      Well, since there's       
nothing I can do about it,      

554
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll give you my blessing.      

555
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,100
          Really?               

556
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
        Darling, I have         
     complete faith in you.     

557
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,200
  If this is the man you want,  
that's good enough for me.      

558
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
          Wait, all right, wait.

559
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,400
            I see what you're   
                     doing here.

560
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,900
  Yeah, y-you think... you think
    that I just wanted to go out

561
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,800
    with your daughter 'cause   
    you said that I couldn't.   

562
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,200
                    And now that
              you say it's okay,

563
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,500
              you're hoping that
                I won't want to.

564
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,700
          Well, that won't work,
      because I really like her.

565
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,000
                So forget it.   
            Come on, Valerie.   

566
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,000
                    Let's go.   

567
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,500
    Gee, I don't know, Sam.     

568
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
                      Why? What?

569
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, it seemed                 
really exciting                 

570
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,500
when Daddy didn't               
want me to date you.            

571
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,000
But now, I don't know.          

572
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,700
It just seems like I'd be       
dating some greasy bartender.   

573
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,600
                 Excuse me?     

574
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,000
    Well...                     

575
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,700
Really, you're not              
exactly my type.                

576
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
          Oh, hey, don't you see
                what he's doing?

577
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,900
Please, Sam.                    

578
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
Let's not prolong this.         

579
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,700
The smell of your hair          
is making me queasy.            

580
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,000
     Well, Sam,                 

581
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
since you've broken             
the agreement,                  

582
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,200
it seems that once again I have 

583
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,400
legal title                     
to your poolroom                

584
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,200
and your bathrooms.             

585
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,400
I'll be expecting the rent      

586
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,100
promptly at the first           
of every month.                 

587
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,600
        Oh, by the way,         

588
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
    I'm doubling the amount.    

589
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,500
            Have a good evening.

590
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
        Oh, he's so bad!        

591
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,400
I hate him!                     

592
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,600
    I hate his whole family!    

593
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,100
        I hate everybody        
      he's ever talked to!      

594
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,400
  Well, you know, I may not be  
 able to take his daughter out, 

595
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,300
and I may have to pay him       
        his stupid rent,        

596
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,200
        but I can still         
    hit him where it hurts.     

597
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
Yeah, you know something?       

598
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,900
    This is the busiest time    
in his restaurant, right?       

599
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,900
          Watch this.           

600
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
          Hey, Reuben,          
         get your coat!         

601
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,500
      We're going dancing!
