00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,475
REBOUND (PART 1 )

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,950
Hey, everybody.
l'm back from my Florida vacation.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,953
Good to be home,
back with the old gang.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,476
Hey, how you been, pal?
Glad to, buddy.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,429
Look at that. Here's the old bar.
lt hasn't changed a bit.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,068
Hey, you're back! Good to see you.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,390
- lt's good to be back.
- Oh, it's you.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,949
From behind
you looked like a friend of mine.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,680
Hey, you kidder. l'll get you for that.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,759
- So, hi, Coach.
- Hi, Cliffie.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,074
Boy, did l have a spectacular time
basking up the old Florida sunshine.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,789
l'll tell you. l really got my head
screwed on straight, too.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,679
That experience changed me.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,152
l'm now at one with the cosmos.
No more getting caught up...

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,676
At one with the cosmos, Coach.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,515
No more getting caught up
in the irritations of day-to-day life...

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,433
l'm just the kinda guy...

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,196
Yeah, l stood on many a wind-swept
beach and felt a oneness...

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,030
felt...a...

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,351
Anybody want a Mai Tai?

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,754
Mai Tai, Cliff! Look! You get it?
Mai Tai, Cliffie!

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,715
- Good afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,233
Beer, Normie?

24
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,949
You know how to make it
sound tempting, you fast talker!

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,878
- Guess who, buddy.
- Hey, Cliffie.

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,190
Missed you the last couple of days.

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,516
- l've been gone two weeks.
- l know.

28
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,591
Oh, God, l missed this guy!

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,435
Norm, how's Vera? Any luck
getting her in the family way yet?

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,718
- Still working on it.
- Hey, Norm, you want a kid?

31
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,237
Not really. l'm just kinda going along
with it to shut Vera up.

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,278
She wants to start a family
to have something to do.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,115
Poor Norm's been shooting blanks
for the last couple of months.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,236
Little louder. We'll dance to it.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,909
Don't worry, Normie. You'll be planting
your seed before you know it.

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,157
l hope so. The doc says
if something doesn't happen soon,

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,675
we may have to take a drastic step.

38
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,150
- You mean...
- Sleep together.

39
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,395
- Our prayers are with you.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,757
Coach, how's Sammy been
since l've been away?

41
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
Just about the same, Cliffie. Terrible.

42
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,599
You should've seen him the other night.
He walks in with this lady librarian.

43
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,718
She's off-duty, right?
They both have a snootful.

44
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,509
- The lady librarian's got...
- Hey, gang!

45
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,515
Never mind. My story's obsolete.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,636
- Coach?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,758
- This is my bar, isn't it?
- Yeah, it sure is, Sam.

48
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,354
l told you l owned a bar.

49
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,636
l like it, Sam.

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,110
lt's not much. But then again, l am.

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,829
Hey, Sammy? l think you got one
over the legal limit there.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,754
Hey, Cliffie's back!
How was your vacation?

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,115
My vacation. You remembered?

54
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,432
- Atlantic City, right?
- Yeah, it was terrific. Thanks a lot.

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,631
What branch of the service
are these young ladies in?

56
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,388
l stole them off the front of a parade
last night, Coach.

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,190
At this very moment there are 26
tuba players marching right into the river.

58
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,035
Show them your stuff, girls.

59
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,709
God, l love it!

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,836
Excuse me, Sam.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,390
While you're waiting
for runway clearance...

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
do you mind taking a look at this?

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,239
This is a piece of paper, isn't it?
And those are words.

64
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,791
- This is a letter or something.
- lt is Joanne's resignation.

65
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,919
Hey, girls, take a break
and give your dimples a rest.

66
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,640
- What?
- We lost another waitress.

67
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,712
She found out
she wasn't the only girl in your life.

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,714
Nonsense, Carla.
She's been listening to vicious rumours.

69
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,838
Sammy, this means
that l have to work alone again.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,470
We can't keep a waitress
because you keep breaking their hearts.

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,950
Well, obviously l need a good talking to.

72
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,554
Sammy, this is serious!

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,632
We've had eight waitresses
in six months.

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,268
Bet l can remember all their names.

75
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,595
Dee Dee, Carlene, Angela, Sneezy,
Dopey, Donner and Blitzen.

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,356
OK, girls, yo!
Step right this way, ladies.

77
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,638
lt's time for the half-time show at the
Sammy-dome. Here you go, step lively!

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,950
Poor Sam.

79
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,076
Yeah, my heart bleeds for him.

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,273
Sure, Cliffie,
he looks like he's having fun,

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,034
but this is just the first stage.

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,397
He's going to end up
drinking himself senseless.

83
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,516
He's turning into a real jerk.

84
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,639
Spends his time boozing
and loving and leaving waitresses.

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,950
l wonder what set him off.

86
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,554
Suppose it might have been Dia...

87
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,272
Diabetes!

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,079
You were going to say that name?

89
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,629
- l wasn't.
- You know my rule.

90
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,475
- But l didn't say it.
- l don't even want you to think it.

91
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,837
Use that name
and l will give you a sunroof.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,911
What difference does it make
how it started?

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,038
The important thing is
can we do anything to stop him?

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,475
lf we can't, can we join him?

95
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,590
lf we can't join him,
do you think he'd let me watch?

96
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,153
Cheers. Yeah, he's here.

97
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,278
l'll give him the message.
Normie, it's Vera.

98
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,671
She says to hurry home.
Her cycle is at its peak.

99
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,398
Again?

100
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,872
Her cycle has more peaks
than the Adirondacks.

101
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,679
All systems are go there, big fella.

102
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,594
Even Secretariat got to wait
till he was in the mood once in a while.

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,353
Poor Coach!
After all you went through with Sam,

104
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,034
seeing him right back where he was.

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,156
Really, Carla, it's eating me up.

106
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,869
l'm so desperate l feel like
l'm going to do something crazy.

107
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,429
l am going to do something crazy!

108
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,832
- Wait. What are you going to do?
- l know exactly what Sam needs.

109
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,711
- Coach, your apron!
- He's got an apron!

110
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,478
- Just put them down there.
- Thank you, Miss.

111
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,838
Now l know why l became a chauffeur
instead of a longshoreman.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,675
l would have been 72
on my next birthday.

113
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,874
l appreciate your bringing me home,
Boggs.

114
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,794
Your mother and l felt strongly
that the first face one should encounter

115
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,952
on leaving a place like that
should be a friendly one.

116
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,873
Why didn't she ever visit me there?

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,156
She wanted to visit you,
Miss Diane,

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,836
but you know how uncomfortable she is
around psychiatrists.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,195
She could have written me a letter.

120
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,477
And let them see her handwriting?

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,396
Boggs, that's insane.

122
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,439
As your mother would say,
''Let's see them prove it in court.''

123
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,114
Which reminds me,
l should be getting back.

124
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,272
- Thanks again for driving me home.
- lt's my pleasure.

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,034
lt's so nice to see you happy again.

126
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,469
Boggs, l think l'm as happy
as l've ever been. l have a new life.

127
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,838
All these wonderful things
have happened to me. l'm better now.

128
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,671
Miss?

129
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,116
l'm fine, Boggs.
l was just a little startled.

130
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,273
- lt's a perfectly normal reaction.
- Perfectly.

131
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,599
- Who is it?
- lt's Ernie Pantusso.

132
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,955
Coach? What do you want?

133
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,759
l have to talk to you. lt's important.

134
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,631
Coach, you're a dear man and l love you
and l've missed you,

135
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,557
but you're part of a period of my life
that l want to see fade into memory.

136
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,476
Do you understand, Coach?

137
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,270
Western Union.

138
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,432
This is a man l could never resist.

139
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,158
- How have you been?
- Fine. And you?

140
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,235
- l'm OK, thank you.
- Sorry l had to fool you that way.

141
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,069
Perhaps l should be taking
this opportunity to be going along.

142
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,432
Say hello to Mummy.
Why don't you have her call me?

143
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,989
You know how she feels
about telephones.

144
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,118
Well, tell her to write. Or, l'll write.

145
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,272
Or maybe we'll just run into
each other sometime.

146
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,513
Nothing would please her more.
Goodbye.

147
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,670
How many pairs of socks
has a guy like that got?

148
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,355
l have no idea.
Can l get you something?

149
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,274
l don't know what l've got. l've been
away several months at a sana...

150
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,476
...vacation.

151
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,029
You didn't run into Cliffie, did you?

152
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,273
No. Did he have
a nervous...vacation, too?

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,396
Oh, he's a wreck.

154
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,796
Listen, Diane,
have you thought about stopping by

155
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,269
and saying hello to everybody?

156
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,670
Coach, that wouldn't be a good idea.

157
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,472
Why?
Does anyone there ask about me?

158
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,279
No, that Carla won't let them.

159
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,599
Diane, l want you to come back
to Cheers and have a talk with Sam.

160
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,071
Talk with S...

161
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,228
Yes, it's very important.

162
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,272
Maybe S...

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,634
Maybe the bartender there didn't tell you
about our last conversation,

164
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,155
but it ended in wrath and acrimony.

165
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,108
l vowed never to return to Cheers.
Let's be clear,

166
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,831
nothing in heaven or hell
will ever get me back there.

167
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,799
Diane, you might be my last chance.

168
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,196
Sam's boozing again.

169
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,471
Oh, dear.

170
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,116
Poor S...

171
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,396
Poor, dear S...

172
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,396
Am!

173
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,229
Well, l'm back.

174
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,190
- What'll it be, Normie?
- A transfusion with a head on it.

175
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,669
Norm, are you sure
you want to have a kid?

176
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,391
Once the monster comes along,
your whole life will be different.

177
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,120
You've had kids.
Does a baby change you?

178
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,068
Are you kidding, Normie?
lt can't even change itself.

179
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,316
Well, l'll have to remember that.

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,150
- What day is it?
- Friday.

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,595
That's it.
Good night, everybody.

182
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,878
- Sam, please! You can't leave.
- Why not?

183
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,033
A friend of yours is dropping by,
and l promised you'd be here.

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,316
Great! One of my old buds?

185
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,598
- l smell high times coming.
- Actually it's an old girlfriend.

186
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,357
Better still. Hope it's one of the wild
ones. But then, weren't they all?

187
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,559
- No, they weren't all wild.
- Hold it right there, Coach!

188
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,756
lf you are talking...

189
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,635
...about the stick, l'll pull your lower lip
over your head like a cabbage leaf.

190
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,828
Cut it out, Carla.
Diane's not coming back here.

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,470
- She said she's not coming back.
- Well, she might.

192
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,835
- What makes you say that?
- l asked her.

193
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,878
- What the hell did you do that for?
- Please listen to her.

194
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,352
- Promise me.
- l know what this is all about.

195
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,909
lt's this drinking crap, isn't it?

196
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,799
l'm drinking because l like it,

197
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,350
because it tastes good,
and because l want to.

198
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,790
l don't want to see Diane Chambers.

199
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,795
You're going to have to see her
because she'll be here any second now!

200
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,999
God! We are all sitting around here
like we're at the Queen's Tea

201
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,197
and that thing is on its way.

202
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,511
ln fact, it's very close. l can sense it.

203
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,753
lt's here! And it's going to walk in
and say something.

204
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,589
Stay out of this, Carla.

205
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,352
Hello...Sam.

206
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,908
Hi there. Did you forget something?

207
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,835
l dropped in to see how you're doing.

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,959
l just got back from Florida, Diane.

209
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,233
Everybody's fine. You're looking good.

210
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,153
- Thank you. How are you doing?
- l've never been better.

211
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,118
For God's sakes, will you stop it, Sam?

212
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,034
You've been boozing with two hands
ever since Diane walked out on you.

213
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,716
- Sam, l'm so sorry.
- You're both crazier than hell!

214
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,235
l threw her out of here and my drinking

215
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,110
has got nothing to do
with Diane Chambers. You hear that?

216
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,635
- Nothing!
- No, you're all wrong.

217
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,756
Sorry!

218
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,151
l did start drinking when she left.
l was celebrating.

219
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,198
Celebrating the day l got rid of you.
You hear?

220
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,510
Celebrating!

221
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,355
l'll tell you something.
l have two birthdays now.

222
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,670
One for when my mother bore me,

223
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,628
and one to commemorate
my glorious rebirth when l left here.

224
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,236
Just once more. You did not walk out,
l kicked you out.

225
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,632
l'd do it again, except no man
deserves that much pleasure in one life.

226
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,395
Your brain could find shelter
in the shade of a snow pea.

227
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,597
Don't, Sam! Please.

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,878
l didn't come here
to fight with you.

229
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,190
l came here to help.

230
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,998
Well, l've never been happier
in my entire life.

231
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,038
You're going to help me out
of all my happiness?

232
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,953
- You're the one person who could do it.
- No.

233
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,759
l want you to see a friend of mine.

234
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,071
He's a man l met recently at a sana...
vacation.

235
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,109
She's been locked up in a mental home
for three months.

236
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,068
l was not locked up. l could come
and go at will. Besides, it's not true.

237
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,076
- And how did you know about it?
- l got a cousin who's a private dick.

238
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,075
l wanted to find out if you were really
gone. And you were really gone!

239
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,519
l entered Golden Brook of my own
volition for a little rest, relaxation...

240
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,429
What are you laughing at?

241
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,513
Well, l've had women get depressed
when they left me,

242
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,558
but l've never had one that went...

243
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,712
Charm like yours is a hard thing
to live without all right.

244
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,394
lt had nothing to do with you, Sam.

245
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,438
After l left here,
l decided l needed to regroup.

246
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,672
l needed to take a good look at myself.

247
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,832
Shock treatment.

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,436
Carla, let's help Sam first.

249
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,798
And when the psychiatric profession
has gained confidence from that triumph,

250
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,633
we'll put them all on your case.

251
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,113
- Will you please meet this man?
- Come on, Diane.

252
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,919
Look... Yeah, l'm drinking again,

253
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,310
but it's not the same thing.

254
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,597
This time
it's good-time controlled drinking.

255
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,830
Before it was negative. Now it's fun.

256
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,033
- lt won't kill you to talk to the guy.
- Coach, it's a waste of time.

257
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,760
Am l right, Carla?

258
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,235
- See what her friend has to say.
- Oh, come on...

259
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,148
- You listening to this, guys?
- Sammy, you're my friend, right?

260
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,790
Don't get defensive,
but maybe you are drinking too much.

261
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,794
- Well, so are you.
- l already have a mother, lush face.

262
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,877
Sorry, l just think maybe
you ought to hear the guy out.

263
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,112
Sammy, the way l see it
is it can't do any harm

264
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,034
and psychiatry has come a long way
since ''The Snake Pit'' age.

265
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,719
Sam, they're all trying to tell you
you need help.

266
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,474
l know what they're saying and why.

267
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,791
Coach here's gotten them all
to gang up on me.

268
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,839
When you try to be a fun-loving drunk,
you find out who your friends are.

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,198
OK, fine, forget it. Drink all you want.
l know the reason why you're doing it.

270
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,749
What are you talking about?

271
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,071
You're afraid that l'm right
about you and the doctor.

272
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,835
You can't stand admitting
l'm right about anything.

273
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,831
Wrong again!

274
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,594
You're scared, Sam.

275
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,512
lf l see this guy and he tells me that
l'm happy and well-adjusted,

276
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,071
which he will, if the quack has a brain,
would you all please leave me alone?

277
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,550
- Of course. Won't we?
- Yeah, sure.

278
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,754
OK, fine. Tell him to drop by.
l'll try to fit him in between dames.

279
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,832
Why don't you say hello
to him now?

280
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,193
l'm Dr Frasier Crane.
Sorry l startled you.

281
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,910
This is weird.

282
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,470
Diane said you're open-minded
and would be responsive,

283
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,710
so l dropped by a little early.

284
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,031
- She said that?
- She says lots of nice things about you.

285
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,957
Really?

286
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,318
So what say we go somewhere
and have a cup of coffee

287
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,710
and...get to know each other?

288
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,351
OK. Fine.

289
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,799
A few cups of lrish coffee and a chat
it is. Mind if l freshen up a bit?

290
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,076
- Fine.
- Thank you, Sam.

291
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,240
Boy, you sure are back in here

292
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,313
for somebody who said
they were never coming back in here.

293
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,393
Human beings change, Sam.
l've changed. So can you.

294
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,358
Rest assured, l'm only visiting.

295
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,590
Correct me if l'm wrong,

296
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,629
but you just called me human
for the first time.

297
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,679
l guess l just needed a little time
to think about it.

298
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,197
- l knew it.
- What?

299
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,035
Are you kidding?
Don't you see she's nuts about me?

300
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,954
Her young Doctor Killjoy there
is just her way of saving face

301
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,076
to get back in the bar.

302
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,516
- l don't know, Sam.
- l know the look.

303
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,671
She's in love.

304
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,353
- l have to run.
- Diane, you're remarkable,

305
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,910
to help a man
who's caused you so much grief.

306
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,594
l'm free of it now, Frasier.

307
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,038
l'm free of so many things now
that l've fallen in love with you.

308
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,350
l am the luckiest person on earth.

309
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,670
The second luckiest.

310
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,870
Not here, Diane.

311
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,314
Of course. l get carried away.

312
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,392
- l understand.
- That's why l love you.

313
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,235
