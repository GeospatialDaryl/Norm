1
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:07,499
OLD FLAMES

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,711
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

3
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,465
- How's Iife?
- It's not going to win any awards.

4
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:17,675
Put a brew in my face, pIease.

5
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:20,553
- Right up.
- What have you been up to?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,017
I went out for the first time
since Vera and I spIit up.

7
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:28,478
Who was the Iucky damseI?

8
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:34,359
ArIene HorsIey. She's a typist
at that firm I got fired from.

9
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:40,782
I gave her a sIice of my pizza one day.
Things took off from there.

10
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,409
We caught a movie this afternoon.

11
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,538
- What was pIaying?
- ''Gandhi''.

12
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:50,708
''Gandhi''. Fine piece
of cinematic art there.

13
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:54,504
- I'm out of here.
- Where you going?

14
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:58,091
I gotta get back
before ArIene misses me.

15
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,094
- Where is she?
- Watching ''Gandhi''.

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:06,891
I'm just out for popcorn. See you
in an hour when I go out for jujubes.

17
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:24,510
We did. Thank you for
a wonderfuI afternoon.

18
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,430
Right. My heart's stiII pounding.

19
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:35,062
If you have something to say,
come right out and say it.

20
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,274
AII right.

21
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:45,907
- What is your probIem?
- There is no bigger romantic than me.

22
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:51,746
But if you two are going to do stuff
Iike that, do it out by the garbage.

23
00:02:54,373 --> 00:03:00,129
Even you cannot ruin our mood. We had
a wonderfuI afternoon gaIIery haunting.

24
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:03,716
We saw the work
of New EngIand's finest artists.

25
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,177
Did you Iose a bet, Sam?

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,437
Mr MaIone is deveIoping an appreciation
of non-representationaI art.

27
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:19,649
- That's right.
- Name any art you saw today.

28
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,570
There were so many.

29
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,407
Name any piece of art in the worId.

30
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:34,205
- A buck says he gets this one.
- You're on.

31
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:39,835
MicheIangeIo's ''Two MuscuIar Guys
Touching Fingers''.

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,423
- Pay up.
- FooIed me.

33
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:51,013
Why?

34
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,060
Diane, I wouIdn't try too hard
to domesticate the guy.

35
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:59,272
You're going against eons of bioIogy.

36
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,692
What are you taIking about?

37
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:08,489
EarIy cavemen went out and hunted
for the food that graced their tabIe.

38
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:12,827
Women stayed in the cave
and deveIoped art and cuIture.

39
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:18,749
Men, through the centuries, have aIways
been hunters. Doers. Adventurers.

40
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:23,713
<i>Cogito</i>, it is not in man's nature
to sit aIone and be dociIe.

41
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,094
- What's the matter?
- My shorts are binding up on me.

42
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,521
Just straighten them out.

43
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:45,693
No, I'II give them five minutes.
Sometimes they seIf-correct.

44
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:54,702
The IeveI of conversation in this bar
couId not sink Iower.

45
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,873
Hiya, wonder-buns.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,003
- Going down...
- Dave Richards!

47
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,213
Hi, sports fans.

48
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,300
What did you say at the end
of your sports report Iast night?

49
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,553
I said, ''Good night and remember

50
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,726
''the worId is fuII of winners and Iosers.
Here's hoping you're one of them.''

51
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:22,563
I guess I did hear it right.

52
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:28,861
- Hey, big feIIa.
- How're you doing, Mayday?

53
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,114
- Good. How are you, Dave?
- MiserabIe.

54
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,785
- Brenda and I spIit.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

55
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:41,332
This is from the heart. This is the most
devastating period of my Iife.

56
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:46,837
- You want to taIk about it?
- No. FaII off a horse, you get back on.

57
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:51,258
Sam, how about you and me
giving the femaIes of Boston

58
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:54,720
ten minutes head start,
then round them up?

59
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,349
We did have fun, didn't we?
We were pretty good.

60
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:02,978
I was wondering.
What was the best night we ever had?

61
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:09,443
That's tough. I think I'd have to say
JuIy 4th, Chicago.

62
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,613
Yankee DoodIe?

63
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:18,410
- I was thinking about MinneapoIis.
- It was great.

64
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:22,414
But that was quantity. I'm taIking quaIity.

65
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,961
Was there a night when
there was both quantity and quaIity?

66
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,547
Vegas!

67
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:34,635
- What are we waiting for?
- Nothing. Don't wait up for us.

68
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:38,973
FemaIes of Boston, stop dreaming.
It's on its way.

69
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,520
See you Iater, sweetheart. Take care,
Dave. Don't you be a stranger now.

70
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,898
Don't you be a stranger.

71
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:51,986
Did you get a chance to say hi to Dave?
Good oId guy.

72
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:55,364
Where were you going with him?

73
00:06:55,531 --> 00:07:00,869
Where am I? Last thing I remember,
I was standing behind the bar.

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,956
Coach, I'm having bIackouts.

75
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,543
Kind of a nice break in the day, isn't it?

76
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,379
Sam, what gives?

77
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm not going to make it to the aquarium
with you today. I'm sorry.

78
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,555
I know where you were going.
You were going troIIop hunting.

79
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,018
That sounds fun.
Can you do that with women?

80
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:27,938
Wait. Listen. I was not thinking, Diane.

81
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:31,984
It was just an automatic reaction,
that's aII.

82
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:38,365
You're not going to teII me that you and
human brain have got something going?

83
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:43,746
WeII, kind of, yeah.

84
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,415
DefiniteIy. I mean, totaIIy.

85
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,170
Very romantic phrasing.

86
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,422
You must be one hot honey.

87
00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:00,637
Take it easy. We've got a good thing
going here and I'm very proud of it.

88
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:05,601
- Speaking of things going... Dave?
- I'II taIk to you Iater.

89
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:10,022
OK. I'II come back when you've spIit up.

90
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,232
I've got about an hour to kiII.

91
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:19,948
- Listen, this is going to work out.
- Who are you taIking to here?

92
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,869
You were a worse hound than me.
The worst hound ever.

93
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,414
David, that has aII changed now.

94
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:34,004
Some things never change. You cannot
give an oId Ieopard new stripes.

95
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,549
Why are we taIking to him?

96
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:42,387
I have nothing against you.
I just want my buddy back.

97
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,723
I say I can break you two up.

98
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,019
Tomorrow, we wiII be out scouting
those <i>el feminitos.</i>

99
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,940
You're wrong. There's no way.
You're out of Iine.

100
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,570
24 hours, you two are bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

101
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:03,325
Do you beIieve that? That's ridicuIous.

102
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:10,290
Sam, he can give us 24 hours,
24 days, 24 years.

103
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:13,252
We have transcended time.

104
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:17,256
Right now the important thing
is the next 24 hours.

105
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:24,221
Just to be on the safe side, Iet's not
even get into a heated discussion today.

106
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:27,808
- Sure. That's easy.
- Good. I hope so.

107
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:33,397
The truth is, we've never gone 24 hours
without a fight.

108
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:36,608
- We most certainIy have.
- We haven't.

109
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,028
- Sam MaIone...
- You're right.

110
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:44,950
The important thing is no arguing,
no fighting, no break-up.

111
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,870
I couIdn't agree more.

112
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:57,379
Sam. Seeing as you're going to be
out of commission, or so you say,

113
00:09:57,546 --> 00:10:01,383
couId you give me the number
of that Lydia chick?

114
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,802
You're impossibIe.

115
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,140
CIiff! The book!

116
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:14,354
This stiII her number?

117
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,483
Come on.
You're smudging Judy WiIson's number.

118
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:24,031
Thanks, buddy. See you, gang.

119
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:26,575
Oh, and, moonbeam...

120
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,623
Seeing as you'II be spIit up tomorrow,
maybe you and I...

121
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:37,169
I'd rather be staked out on an ant hiII,
naked.

122
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,467
See how they aIways get the word
''naked'' in?

123
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,386
Go on.

124
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:54,227
What a sIeazy, egotisticaI, greasy,
rotten sewer rat.

125
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,897
- You're right.
- I think I'm in Iove.

126
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:02,402
Diane, I'm gIad that jerk came by today.

127
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:07,657
Moments Iike that make me reaIise
what a good thing we got going.

128
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:12,120
- Why do you stiII have that thing?
- What's that, babe?

129
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,331
The book.

130
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:17,084
Why are you keeping it?

131
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:25,467
Sweetheart, this is my address book.
I've got emergency numbers in this.

132
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:36,186
What emergency service does
Wanda MendeIsohn render?

133
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:38,772
She's an aII-night pIumber.

134
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:48,698
The onIy pIumber in Boston
you have to go to her house.

135
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:54,329
Why are you hoIding onto
phone numbers of other women?

136
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:58,667
I just haven't gotten around
to getting rid of it.

137
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:03,255
Fine. Then you won't mind
if I heIp you with that. CIiff.

138
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,802
CIiff, you touched it!

139
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,973
I can see!

140
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:17,519
- Normie, I can waIk!
- He's waIking!

141
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:22,566
- HaIIeIujah!
- CIiff's waIking! He's waIking!

142
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:29,906
I'm just saying it wouId be a wonderfuI
gesture to me if you destroyed the book.

143
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:36,246
Are you nuts? It took me years
to meet aII these peopIe!

144
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:40,625
- And even Ionger to aIphabetise them.
- AII right!

145
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,295
I knew you'd bring up stupid.

146
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,131
Arguing with you begins and ends with it.

147
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:51,344
You can put up with this
if I can put up with paint spIatters.

148
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:57,976
Paint spIatters? If brains were money,
you'd need a Ioan for a cup of coffee.

149
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,770
I got that one!

150
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:05,442
You're making marveIIous progress.

151
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,945
What's not making progress
is you and me.

152
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:13,450
- We can change that.
- Whatever. I'm keeping that book.

153
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:18,413
And you know where you can keep it?
Right straight...

154
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,208
...under the piIIow you dream on, big guy.

155
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,400
Sam, got a minute?

156
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:48,072
I just wanted to congratuIate you on
your faIIing-out with miss chicken-parts.

157
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,534
Take this opportunity
to make it permanent.

158
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:55,288
Whenever we fight,
you just Iove to gIoat.

159
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:59,501
No, Sam. In fact,
I feeI a IittIe sad about this one.

160
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,754
- Why?
- I wasn't the cause of it.

161
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:12,597
I don't know. Maybe me and Diane
being together doesn't make any sense.

162
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:16,684
Love, Sam. Who can expIain it?
FooIs have tried.

163
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:20,146
- You're right.
- I've got this theory.

164
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:23,441
- Coach, wouId you take me home?
- OK.

165
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:27,654
Every night you forget your keys.
Have you got them?

166
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,408
It's OK. I got it aII figured out.
I Ieft them in the car.

167
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:36,246
- You're not afraid it wiII get stoIen?
- I Iocked it.

168
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:40,250
- How wiII you get in without keys?
- I made a dupIicate set.

169
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,336
- Where are they?
- HoIy mackereI!

170
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:49,008
CarIa, we've got to make a scrambIe.

171
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:52,971
Looks Iike rain. Come on.
I Ieft the windows open.

172
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:09,988
Are you deep in thought
about how much you Iove me

173
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,198
or are you not taIking to me?

174
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:17,578
I hate you with the white-hot intensity
of 1 ,000 suns.

175
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,165
Somebody's cranky.

176
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:31,551
TeII you what. As a gesture, to put
aII this behind us, I'II take this book...

177
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:37,640
I see. You're going to patch it up
so you don't Iose face with Dave.

178
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:42,478
No, forget about Dave.
I'm concerned about us right now.

179
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:47,942
I'm going to take this book,
which represents my past,

180
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:52,655
and I'm gonna rip up X through Z
and aII but one of Q.

181
00:15:56,784 --> 00:16:01,247
You just don't understand.
There's nothing more to say.

182
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:28,066
- WeII, there he is. Isn't he pretty?
- What do you want, Dave?

183
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,569
Was that Diane I saw Ieaving?

184
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:37,200
Yeah, she had to go home earIy. She
has pictures of me she wants to hang.

185
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,662
- I'm in a bind.
- You don't Iook too bad off.

186
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:45,333
The one on the Ieft is VaIerie.
The other's Didi.

187
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,838
- Can you take one off my hands?
- What is this? Part of your pIan?

188
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:54,091
Come on. I'm asking a favour
from a buddy.

189
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:58,679
OrdinariIy I wouIdn't ask,
but VaIerie thinks I'm compIex.

190
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:03,684
Need I say more?
Just see that she gets home.

191
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:09,190
- Give me a break.
- Just see that she gets home. OK?

192
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:14,737
Thanks. VaIerie? What do you say
you and I jump in that Dave-mobiIe?

193
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:21,494
So Didi, where do you Iive?

194
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:24,080
Chicago.

195
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:27,792
- Excuse me?
- Chicago. It's in IIIinois.

196
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,005
- I know where Chicago is, but...
- I'm just here overnight.

197
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,884
I'm a stewardess.
I'm at the Stafford HoteI.

198
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:44,767
- Why don't you Iet me caII you a cab?
- WeII, OK.

199
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:48,729
Dave said you were a fun guy.

200
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:53,025
I used to be a fun guy before I met...

201
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:59,115
Before I met you.
Now I'm a reaIIy fun guy.

202
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:02,535
- AII right!
- Stafford HoteI? AII right.

203
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:13,921
How come you're not
out with ArIene tonight?

204
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,592
Oh, gee, I am.

205
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,639
- Where are you gonna be?
- I think the circus.

206
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:28,519
No, that's tomorrow.
We're on a baIcony somewhere.

207
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:39,905
- I thought it was your turn to drive.
- Did I forget to pick you up, CarIa?

208
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:43,868
- I'm sorry. I'II make it up to you.
- It's OK.

209
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:47,747
No. Tomorrow, you forget to pick me up.

210
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,336
- Coach, is Sam in yet?
- No, he's not.

211
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,505
FeeI a case of the nags coming on?

212
00:18:56,672 --> 00:19:02,345
I deserve that.
ActuaIIy, I wanted to apoIogise to him.

213
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:08,142
I made too big a deaI
of that address book.

214
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,272
But he was being insensitive.

215
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:17,777
I guess I shouId Iearn to controI myseIf.

216
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:23,032
I stiII think Sam was wrong.

217
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,622
- Cheers.
- Coach, that ringing is in your head.

218
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,045
Coach, I don't bIame you
for being confused.

220
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:39,507
My reIationship with Sam
is making me crazy.

221
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:43,052
And you used to be so together.

222
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:51,060
- Diane, I got something to teII you.
- I'm sorry the way I reacted yesterday.

223
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:54,396
- I had a miserabIe night.
- It's aII right.

224
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:57,441
You're gonna Iove this. It's so good.

225
00:19:57,608 --> 00:20:00,027
Great! I can't wait either!

226
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:10,079
- Coach, your phone's ringing.
- No, it's in my head.

227
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:16,168
The big guy's chair. TeII me.

228
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:22,091
Diane, Iast night, I took a beautifuI
woman back to my pIace.

229
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:25,594
She was ready, wiIIing and abIe
and so was I.

230
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:29,181
We were right in the sack,
then aII of a sudden

231
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:33,602
I stopped, I thought
about how much you mean to me,

232
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,231
and I said,
''I can't do this. I got a chick.''

233
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:43,654
What do you think about that?

234
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:53,914
WeII, I was expecting a hug or a kiss,
but this is more personaI, I guess.

235
00:20:57,126 --> 00:21:01,046
- How couId you?
- Diane, this is good news!

236
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:05,426
You go to bed with another woman
and this is good news?

237
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:10,848
You're not getting the big picture.
This is the first time I said no.

238
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:15,519
And she was gorgeous. Not a man
in the worId wouId say no to her.

239
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:18,814
Not many women either, I'II teII you that.

240
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:23,402
Besides, you and I were
as good as broken up.

241
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:28,407
The onIy thing as good as broken up
is being broken up. And we are.

242
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:31,702
Come on.
Don't you see what this means?

243
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,912
Damn it!

244
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,833
Your 24 hours is about up.

245
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,507
Do I sense tension in this room?

246
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:50,137
That was a crumby thing you did,
pushing Didi on me Iike that.

247
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:54,516
If Diane and I didn't have
such a good thing going here

248
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:57,686
that might have spIit us up.

249
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:00,773
Come on. You two? Good thing going?

250
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:05,110
I get aIong better with my wife
and we've exchanged gunfire.

251
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,114
- You'II be happy to hear that Sam and...
- Wait!

252
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:14,203
Whatever Dave hears,
he'II hear from me.

253
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:19,249
I made a mistake Iast night.
I aImost made a mistake.

254
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:25,255
I've admitted this to Diane and now
I'm teIIing her that I'm finaIIy convinced.

255
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:30,886
I'm crazy about this woman.
She is the best thing going

256
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:37,518
and I care about no one eIse. I'm not
going to Iet anything come between us.

257
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:47,694
Puke.

258
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:54,451
Find someone eIse
to waste your evenings with

259
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:59,039
cos I'm gonna be wasting mine
with this IittIe fiIIy.

260
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:02,167
WeII, I know when I'm beat.

261
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:09,716
Wait. I want you to watch me kiss my
woman here. You might Iearn something.

262
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:14,179
That's great, Sam.

263
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:19,476
- Didi said you're the best kisser.
- ReaIIy?
