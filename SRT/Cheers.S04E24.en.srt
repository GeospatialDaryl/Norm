1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,358
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,072
Oh, boy, that's the third time
you beat me, Mike.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,913
- I guess I owe you another beer.
- No, that's okay. I gotta run.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,719
I'll take a rain check
on that one, huh?

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,873
Lost again, huh?

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,872
Yeah, I don't know what's the matter
with me.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,031
It seems like that guy just has
my number, you know?

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,276
Forget about it.
Next time he comes in here,

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,352
you just challenge him
to some ltalian arm wrestling.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,750
- Oh, I never tried that.
- Come here.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,911
Give me your arm.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,873
Okay, now, I'm gonna pull
as hard as I can,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,871
and you resist me
with all your strength.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,315
- All right.
- Go.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,791
I beat Carla!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,797
And I'm not even ltalian.

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,719
You wine them.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,518
You dine them.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,432
Tell them how pretty they are.

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,431
Buy them fancy presents.

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,792
Finally, you get up the nerve to ask
one of the little dears to marry you.

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,235
What do you get
for all your trouble? Squat.

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,750
I thought you'd pretty much gotten
over that Diane problem of yours.

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,478
Oh, it's not as serious as it sounds.

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,519
See, this is the one-year anniversary of
the day Diane deserted me at the altar.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,513
To repress my bitterness would be
detrimental to my recovery.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,433
So on this day, and on this day alone,

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,398
I'm going to spew out my venom

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,916
and exorcise the blond demon
that haunts my soul.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,472
Well, happy anniversary.

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,239
Holy moly guacamole.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Terre Haute, lndiana.

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,477
Oh, I wouldn't throw her out of my bed
for eating crackers.

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,069
Why else would she be there?

35
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,468
Yeah, that's very humorous, Normie.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,029
Yeah, in light of the fact that
a leading woman's magazine

37
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,510
just recently completed a survey
which showed that postmen

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,477
are the most desired lovers
right after--

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,154
Rock stars and heart surgeons.

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,191
Well, you know what they
say down at the P.O...

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,954
"Postmen deliver daily."

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,718
Have we had this
conversation before, Norm?

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,190
Cliffie, we've had every
conversation before.

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,994
Boy, when people start finishing
each other's sentences, they're--

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,230
Spending far too much time together.

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,756
Say, Woody, let me have
another beer there.

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,512
Hey, did you hear
the one about the--?

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,358
Shepherd and the parrot? Yeah.

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,716
That was a good one.

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,150
- I had a very nice time, Brian.
- Me too.

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,716
Well, well, if it isn't
Kitten With a Whip.

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,271
That's funny.

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,869
Sam, I'd like you to meet Brian.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,234
Brian, this is Sam.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,719
And...?

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,997
Oh, this is, yeah, April.
April, that's Brian.

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,718
Hi.

58
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,754
- And I'm obviously, I guess, Diane.
- Oh, right, yeah.

59
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,912
- So you two have a good time?
- Oh, very nice. Very nice time.

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,749
- Yeah, we had a great time.
- Yeah, we had a fabulous time.

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,751
It was just a movie
and a burger afterwards.

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,238
Oh, but what a film. And the ground
beef was excellent, very lean.

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,239
Listen, I wanna thank you
for giving me a ride home.

64
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,078
That's a great car you've got there.

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,550
Yes, Brian has a wonderful car too,
and it gets excellent mileage.

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,676
What kind of mileage you get?

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,832
Thirty-five on the highway,
26 around town.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,919
Thirty-two and 24. Sorry.

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,269
Well, thanks again.

70
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,556
Good night.

71
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,750
What a putrid display.

72
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,197
You know, people come here
to relax and enjoy themselves.

73
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,510
They don't wanna look at that.
Do you?

74
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,153
Yeah!

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,870
This is sick.

76
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,874
Brian has a big-screen TV.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,918
- April has a satellite dish.
- You are so childish.

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,713
Excuse me, are you the owner?

79
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,273
Yeah, that's right, Sam Malone.

80
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,512
Hi. Phil Schumacher, campaign
manager for Janet Eldridge.

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,836
She's running for re-election
to city council.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,879
Listen, the councillor is just down the
street on a walking tour of the district.

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,230
Would it be all right
if she came in to meet the folks,

84
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,437
and perhaps answer some questions
for the newspaper reporters?

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,596
- Sure. Why not?
- Great. Thanks a lot, Sam.

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,797
Hey, how about that? We're a stop
on the old campaign trail.

87
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,315
Oh, Sam. You're so politically naive.

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,153
Janet Eldridge is an
old-money conservative

89
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,198
who consistently supports
big-business interests

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,638
over badly-needed social programs.
She's a real political opportunist.

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,748
Well, if she's that bad,
I'll have her out of here in a flash.

92
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,236
Ladies and gentlemen,
Councillor Janet Eldridge.

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,036
She's got until Christmas,
then she's out of here.

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,711
I could use your support
in the upcoming election.

95
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,995
Yeah, right.

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,350
You got fame, money,
power and looks.

97
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,875
- What you need, I ain't got.
- I need your vote.

98
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,914
I need a man. But you don't see me
going around bars begging for one.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,477
I give. I know when I'm overmatched.
I'm glad I'm not running against you.

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,875
She's smooth. I'll give her that.

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,430
Sam, I'd like you to meet Councillor
Eldridge. Councillor, this is--

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,352
"Mayday" Malone needs
no introduction to me

103
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,635
or anyone else in this town.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,991
I was a big fan when you pitched for
the Sox. I think you're just wonderful.

105
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,633
Well, it's mutual.

106
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,549
- Oh, you're a fan of the councillor's?
- No, I think I'm wonderful too.

107
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,114
Hey, hey, hey, Sammy.

108
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,714
Unless these tired old eyes
are deceiving me, pal,

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,440
there's something going on
between you and the councillor.

110
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,916
I don't think so. No, no, no.

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,719
Watching that woman work this room
has brought me to a decision.

112
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,350
You've decided to work it too
for a change?

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,034
I'm going to campaign
for Janet Eldridge's opponent

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,509
- in the coming election.
- Is that right?

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,995
I've voted for him before,
but he really needs my help now.

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,636
Would anyone like to join me
in this campaign?

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,873
Working side by side untiringly
to carry James Fleener to victory?

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,075
I would.

119
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,189
James Fleener is the finest man
to enter public life in the last decade.

120
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,032
I'd be honoured to work for him.

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,234
All right. He needs all the help
he can get.

122
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,109
Who the hell is James Fleener?

123
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,038
- Boy, oh, boy, is Miss Eldridge pretty.
- Yeah.

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,158
You know, back home in Hanover,
everybody on the town council

125
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,880
has a paunch and smokes
big, smelly cigars.

126
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,396
Don't you have any women
on the town council there?

127
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,477
Yeah.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,554
Sammy, I've been noticing
she just can't take her eyes off you.

129
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,075
- You gonna ask her out?
- What are you talking about?

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,470
Well, look at her.

131
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,989
She's a good woman, Sam.
She deserves it.

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,639
I don't know.

133
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,393
Yeah, politics makes
strange bedfellows, Sam.

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,109
So do you and anyone or anything.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,477
I guess she's a little out of your league
when you come right down to it, huh?

136
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,835
Yeah, what's the matter, Sam?
She too much for you?

137
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,554
I just don't think it's a good idea
to hop into bed with someone

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,153
who could raise my taxes.

139
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,109
Councillor Eldridge will take
a few questions now.

140
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,475
Jerry Baker, Boston Star.

141
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,355
Councillor, do you support the effort of
the so-called Grant Avenue Coalition

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,114
to overturn the city council's rezoning

143
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,191
of that neighbourhood
for commercial use?

144
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,630
I voted in favour of rezoning
and would do so again.

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,031
My reasons are a matter of public
record. No, I do not support them.

146
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,357
Clifford C. Clavin, U.S. Postal Service,
South Central Branch.

147
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,273
In view of the carnage taking place
in our postal routes,

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,795
are you in favour of beefing up
our leash laws to include

149
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,872
Iife imprisonment for
the canine offenders?

150
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,234
I think that's a bit drastic,
but I am in favour of doing all we can

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,034
to support our overworked
and underpaid postal carriers.

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,792
You do a wonderful job.

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,669
That woman has got my support,
and I will deliver you the postal vote.

154
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,957
Too bad it'll be to the wrong address.

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,435
My name is Diane Chambers,
and I have a question.

156
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,553
- Do you work here?
- How come no one ever knows that?

157
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,393
Yes, I'm a waitress and proud of it.

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,678
In a work-ethic kind of way.

159
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,717
Councillor, you have been accused

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,678
of being out of touch
with your constituency.

161
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,831
Do you expect this stroll
through the neighbourhood

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,638
to make up for four years of neglect?

163
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,193
- Hold on just--
- It's all right.

164
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,830
Miss Chambers, I represent every
one of the people in my district.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,911
If I don't get out and talk
as often as I'd like,

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,071
it's because I'm in my office
or at council meetings

167
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,710
or in conference with civic
and business leaders 1 6 hours a day.

168
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,275
I've never missed a vote
in my four years on the council,

169
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,755
and if I'm elected again
I intend to work even harder

170
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,390
for the people
I am privileged to represent.

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,113
Good, Diane,
you got her on the ropes.

172
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,276
Tom Edwards, Boston Sentinel.

173
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,789
Oh, excuse me, I think this gentleman
had his hand up first.

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,355
Yeah, I'm not a reporter,
I'm just a voter.

175
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,953
But I have a very important question.

176
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,238
Do you like Chinese food, and if so,
have you ever eaten it in the bathtub?

177
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,279
Yes, and no comment.

178
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,392
Well, in that case I have
a follow-up question here.

179
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,710
What are you doing for dinner
Thursday night?

180
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,836
The offer is very tempting, Mr Malone,
but I will have to respectfully decline.

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,514
- The campaign keeps me very busy.
- I understand.

182
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,871
What I won't give up
for the people of this district.

183
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,958
- Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you very much.

184
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,272
Look at that, Norm.
She shot Sammy down.

185
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,750
Impeachment proceedings
should begin immediately.

186
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,712
She may be out of touch
with the common man,

187
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,872
but she can sure spot
a common roach.

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,758
- Sam?
- Yeah?

189
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,514
This is Janet's private number.

190
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,875
She wants you to call her.

191
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,356
- Guys, Janet's private number here.
- All right!

192
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,035
Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,919
Fleener! Fleener! Fleener!

194
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,350
Okay. Fleener!

195
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,755
- Sammy! Sammy!
- Fleener! Fleener!

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,631
Say, Diane...

197
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,554
...did you happen to hear
that Sam is going out

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,280
with Councillor Eldridge
again tonight?

199
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,510
I believe I heard something like that.

200
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,871
Did you know it was for dinner
at the governor's mansion?

201
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,508
I recall someone mentioning it.

202
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,877
Did they also mention that
they were going in a limousine?

203
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,471
- A limo?
- Not a limo.

204
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,200
A limousine.

205
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,836
So, what are you
doing tonight, Diane?

206
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,476
Frasier and I are going canvassing
for Jim Fleener in the neighbourhood,

207
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,950
and then we're stuffing mailers
into envelopes later on.

208
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,476
Well, that sounds like fun too.

209
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,795
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

210
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,520
- Norman.
- What's happening, Mr Peterson?

211
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,917
The question is, Woody,
why is it happening to me?

212
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,548
Well, you're a little late there, Normie.
Where you been?

213
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,280
Well, I was at Hurley's Market.

214
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,989
I took Vera out for a little grocery
shopping, then a little dinner.

215
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,469
Oh, gee, that's nice, Mr P.
Where did you go to dinner?

216
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,272
Hurley's Market.

217
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,194
They were giving out those little
sausage samples on toothpicks.

218
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,072
By the way, guys,
for your information,

219
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,198
a dozen appears to be
the cut-off number.

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,229
Say, did you hear that I'm going to
the governor's place tonight for dinner?

221
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,719
Yes.

222
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,957
There was a rumour in the air.

223
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,634
Back when there was air.

224
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,392
You got a second here?

225
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,551
Listen...

226
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,632
...you know that ice cream stuff they
serve in the middle of dinner there?

227
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,592
- Is it okay--?
- Sorbet.

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,113
Sorbet, right, sorbet.

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,277
Is it okay if I were to ask
for chocolate sauce with that?

230
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,437
- I think it's wise not to.
- All right, all right.

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,556
And for God's sake,
remember that a bowl of warm water

232
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,631
- with a slice of lemon in it--
- I know, I know.

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,116
It's a finger bowl,
it's not lemon soup.

234
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,910
You know, nobody would've known
that time if you hadn't screamed.

235
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,273
You certainly have been at
the councillor's beck and call lately.

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,558
I never thought I'd see you
so controlled by a woman.

237
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,798
What happened to the Sam Malone
who once said to me,

238
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,350
"Hey, we're gonna do
what I wanna do from now on"?

239
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,916
You left him in a restaurant
with a face full of fettuccini.

240
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,554
That doesn't mean I didn't like him.

241
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,794
"Wim with Jim?"

242
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,155
I thought it up.
It's very Joycean.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,312
If that means stupid, I agree.

244
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,794
Frasier, put the box
in the back, please.

245
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,518
If you're looking for something to do,
you can start stuffing the envelopes.

246
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,353
I've been stuffing all day, Diane.

247
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,075
Frankly, the task has lost its
considerable power to charm me.

248
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,155
Frasier, that's a defeatist attitude.

249
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,311
We don't need quitters
on the Fleener team.

250
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,115
- Hey, Sam, you're on TV.
- Oh, yeah, look at that.

251
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,471
- Nice-looking threads, Sam.
- Yeah.

252
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,831
Janet picked out the suit. She really
knows what looks good on the tube.

253
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,755
Carla,

254
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,117
even though we have our differences,
and we're frequently at odds,

255
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,636
there's one thing we very much have
in common:

256
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,474
We both like Sam.

257
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,193
And I'm concerned about him.

258
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,070
I think he might get hurt by this liaison
with Janet Eldridge.

259
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,429
Yeah, you're right.

260
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,398
He's having a lot of laughs
and a hot time with a beautiful woman.

261
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,393
The man is a glutton for punishment.

262
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,712
This is no romp, Carla.
It's more serious than that.

263
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,997
And the worst part is that she's just
using him. I mean, it all adds up.

264
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,435
He's an outstanding sports figure,

265
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,194
he's attractive, and in this town
it doesn't hurt that he's lrish.

266
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,396
- He's a vote getter.
- So what?

267
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,757
So when the election's over,
it's "So long, Sam."

268
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,753
And I think he's really going to be
hurt by this. That's "so what."

269
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,430
You are full of beans. Women come
and women go in Sam's life.

270
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,479
He's just having a few grins,
and I can prove it.

271
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,395
Hey, a word over here, heartthrob.

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,033
Coming at you.

273
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,872
Cliffie, Cliffie. I got this one.

274
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,470
You know, Sammy,
I've been thinking.

275
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,393
You have got a great set-up
with this Eldridge babe.

276
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,397
You're going to all these
high-toned parties,

277
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,154
meeting a lot of fancy people,
driving around in big cars.

278
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,710
And the best thing is,
you are getting to do to a politician

279
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,599
what they've been doing
to us for years.

280
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,998
You know, Carla, sometimes
you got a lousy sense of humour.

281
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,633
Sorry.

282
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,679
"A few grins," Carla?

283
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,230
- Boy, you look fabulous.
- Thank you. So do you.

284
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,753
Well, thank you.

285
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,115
Listen, I am famished here.

286
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,157
Do you know what kind of sorbet
they're serving?

287
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,194
- No, I was curious about that myself.
- Well--

288
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,351
Before we go I have to make
a couple of phone calls.

289
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,318
- May I use your office?
- Yeah. Right under the whale there.

290
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,512
Look at the size of that limo.

291
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,511
Hey, Your Excellence?

292
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,349
- Does it have a TV?
- Yes, it does.

293
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,592
Go and take a look at it if you want.

294
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,711
Oh, hot dog!

295
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,595
- Oh, boy, the exuberance of youth.
- Yeah. Wide-eyed and innocent.

296
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,868
Well, I guess those days
are long gone for you and me.

297
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,951
Yeah, yeah.

298
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,555
Thanks, Edith. Yeah, I'll talk to you
tomorrow. Bye-bye.

299
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,075
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Councillor Eldridge.

300
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,829
Please, call me Janet. What can I do
for you? It's Diane, isn't it?

301
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,117
Yes.

302
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,352
I'm speaking on behalf
of everyone here at Cheers,

303
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,798
and I would just like to say
that we're all very fond of Sam.

304
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,389
And, frankly, we're a little worried
about him.

305
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,710
We wouldn't like to see him get hurt.

306
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,239
What are you getting at?

307
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Janet, I've made no secret
of my opposition to you politically,

308
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,158
but let's retract our claws
for the moment, shall we?

309
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,437
Let's stop hissing at each other.

310
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,877
Do you have a problem with cats?

311
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,872
No.

312
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,792
But it's the consensus of opinion
around here

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,554
that you're using Sam
to get re-elected,

314
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,358
with total disregard for his feelings,

315
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,750
and we don't think that's
a very nice thing to do.

316
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,551
I see.

317
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,233
Well, I'll be honest with you, Diane.

318
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,709
That's exactly why
I started seeing him.

319
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,033
So l-- We were right.

320
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,718
Well, I'm warning you,
I have some influence with Sam.

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,552
Yes, I know.
He thinks a great deal of you.

322
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,756
Anytime I wanted to--
He said that?

323
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,797
Yes.

324
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,715
He mentions you often.
And Sam is a man of few words.

325
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,189
Well, he only knows a few.

326
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,313
Yes.

327
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,313
He is a simple man in many ways,
but I think that's his strength.

328
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,914
I mean, I never met anyone
who didn't like him.

329
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,469
Well, good.

330
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,710
But I don't understand
why we're standing here

331
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,874
chatting so enjoyably when you just
admitted that you're using Sam.

332
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,918
That's not what I said, Diane.

333
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,071
You didn't let me finish.

334
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,272
Please.

335
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,911
Well, when I first started
seeing Sam,

336
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,390
perhaps I had ulterior motives
in mind,

337
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,120
but my attitude toward him
has changed dramatically.

338
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,231
I've learned that Sam has something
that's pretty special.

339
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,118
I've never experienced
with any other man

340
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,840
the feeling I have when I'm with him.

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,468
When we're at a fundraiser
or something like that,

342
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,315
I'll watch him across the room
talking with some people,

343
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,189
and sometimes a feeling
comes over me so strong

344
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,828
that it nearly makes me ache.

345
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,277
Oh, God.

346
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,033
I sound like a silly schoolgirl.

347
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,199
That's the truth.
Does that make you feel better?

348
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,472
It certainly does.

349
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,952
I'm awfully glad
we put this matter to rest.

350
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,918
You like Sam. And Sam likes you.

351
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,755
No one's going to get hurt.
Well, "wack to berk."

352
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,397
Boy, you're really good.
You almost had me fooled there.

353
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,153
But I don't believe a word you said.

354
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,358
When this campaign is over,

355
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,149
Sam's going to last about as long
as your campaign promises.

356
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,594
Well, back to work.

357
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,078
And I would like to thank
each and every one of you.

358
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,317
- This is a victory for all of us.
- Yes!

359
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,795
Well, not quite all of us.

360
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,876
I guess that's about--

361
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,951
I guess that's about it. Thanks.

362
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,991
Thanks, Diane, for all your help.

363
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,674
Nobody ever worked harder
for me than you.

364
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,589
In fact, I think you worked harder
than I did.

365
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,109
You did your best.
That's all that matters.

366
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,518
Say, listen, did you know
you're out of liquor?

367
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,793
And now I would like
to bring up a man

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,309
without whom I would not be
standing here tonight.

369
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,469
- Sam?
- Yeah?

370
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,438
- Would you let Phil through, please?
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,915
My campaign manager,
Mr Phil Schumacher!

372
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,953
And this guy

373
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,680
has been such a tremendous
help to me in this campaign.

374
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,115
I'm sure he needs no introduction.

375
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,078
But for those ladies in the audience
who would like an introduction,

376
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,356
you're not gonna get one.

377
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,031
That was my last chance.

378
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,555
Looks like I blew it.

379
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,116
Me too.
