WOMAN ( <i>on TV</i> ):        
     You're up pretty late,     
          aren't you?

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,500
Nothing better to do      
         than watch TV?

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,100
Feeling a little lonely     
        in the big city?

Come and join the party.

Call 5, double five, P-R-T-Y,

for the best party line     
    in Boston, that's right.

Why don't you try it?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,700
There's only one way to find out

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,500
what sort of wild people    
      call the party line.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Dial 5, double five, P-R-T-Y.

Hi, my name's Woody

Oh, hi, Mr. Clavin.

How about over here             
by the bar, Miss Howe?

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,600
Do we really have to do this?

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,900
What's going on?

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll be right with you.

The <i>Globe's</i> doing an article    
on women who run pubs.

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
Now he wants                    
to take my picture.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,100
I really dread this, Sam.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,900
Why?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Because I get               
    so tensed up

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in front of a camera.

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,100
All of a sudden

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
I start looking like something 
      the cat coughed up.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,600
Ooh, can I have    
             an eight-by-ten    
             for my mantelpiece?

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,000
How about a two-by-four         
for your bridgework?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Listen, let me give you         
a few hints here.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,200
I had a lot of pictures taken   
of me when I was playing ball.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,900
Just relax, take        
     the tip of your tongue

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
and wet your lips.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Good.

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
Now, wet my lips.

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,800
Oh, Malone!

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Uh-oh, you're tensing           
up now, just relax.

No, wait a minute!

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can't use that picture!

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,700
I had my tongue
                 sticking out.

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,400
Can I have three        
        copies of that?

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
Now, please, take  
             another picture and
             warn me this time.

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,900
I want this to look     
        natural and spontaneous.

57

Come on, come on.               
You gotta relax.

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Think of something              
ridiculous.

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,100

the Snoopy puppets              
I use with the kids.

63
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,900
Thanks, Miss Howe.

Boy, oh, boy.

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,000
How many times have I walked  
    through that door, huh?

66
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,200
Yep, good-bye old bar.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
Take care, old stool.

68

Where you       
                going, Cliff?

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm going in                    
for surgery tomorrow.

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,600
Who knows if I'll ever          
walk into God's blue sky again.

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,100
It's all up                     
to the man upstairs.

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,300
Vic, the maître d'

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,600
No, Woody.          
             No, never mind.

74
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,900
What, what are you, what
        are you talking about?

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Well, it took               
    a lot of expensive

76
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,000
and complicated             
    tests, Sammy,

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,700
but they finally            
    found out

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,900
what that pain was          
    in my abdomen.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,600
The experts call it         
    appendicitis.

                come on.

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,300
Now, that's a simple...
         you know, I had it     
         when I was a kid.

83
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,500
There's nothing
                 to it.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,000
I actually liked                
having my appendix out.

85
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,700
My parents told me I could      
have all the ice cream I wanted.

No, Woody,

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
I think you're        
          talking about tonsils.

88
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
Well, it was a long time ago,   
Sam, but I'm pretty sure

89
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,800
it was ice cream.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
So when are you going in?

91
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,300
It's tomorrow.

about your little

109
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
We're talking about

So, now,    
                  where was I?

111
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,400
So you gonna see

Of course. Okay,                
gather around everybody.

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,300
I'll show you the interstates  
    we're gonna take.

118
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,900
Sam, can I talk to you     
         for a minute?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Sure, have a seat.

120
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,500
Frasier and I

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,800
will be covering over           
4,500 miles round trip,

122
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
and I think it's only fair

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,600
that I share                    
some of the driving.

124
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,500
However, I am handicapped       
by one tiny thing.

125
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,200
I've never operated             
a motorized vehicle before.

126
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,100
You don't know
                  how to drive?

127
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,800
I always meant to learn,

128
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,800
but when I was a teenager,      
I was too busy having fun.

129
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
Would you teach me, Sam?

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,200
Uh, well, what
                  about Frasier?

131
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,400
We're too close.

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,100
I need someone                  
to whom I have

133
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,500
no emotional                    
attachment whatsoever.

134
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,600
So as a friend,                 
would you do me this favor?

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,700
Yeah, why not?

136
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,800
When do we start?

137
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,600
The sooner the better.

138
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
All right.

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Um, how do you         
         think I'll do?

140
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I've never had a woman in  
     a car that didn't do great.

141
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,000
Wonderful.

142
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
You teach me to drive,

143
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,500
I'll help you                   
with your sense of humor.

144
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Here's where you've   
        got to be real careful.

145
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,600
You see, I-75 runs     
     right down here into I-30.

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
Now, if you don't stay in that 
         far left lane,

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,400
it's hello, Tulsa!

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,100
Well, I've got to be            
moseying on, you guys.

149
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,100
I'll, you know,                 
see you later.

150
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm going under the knife       
in about 12 hours or so.

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,600
Yeah, look, don't feel

152
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,500
that you have to go         
out of your way to stop by,

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,100
you know, and visit,

154
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,300
New England Presbyterian,       
Room one niner four,

155
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,900
visiting hours between          
11:00 and 9:00.

156
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,500
Cliffie, I'm sure everything
    is going to be just okay.

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, yeah, well, no,       
      sure, there's no...

158
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,100
You know, I'm in the hands      
of skilled professionals.

159
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,300
It's not like the old days,

160
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
is it, you know, where     
they give you a shot of whiskey,

161
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,200
lick the scalpel and they       
    go a-carving, huh?

162
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,600
You know, the same is true      
    in my profession.

163
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,900
Time was when a person's    
    behavior deviated in any way

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
from what society 
              considered normal,

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
the town barber             
    would take a rusty drill,

166
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,800
bore a hole in your head,       
and let the evil spirits out.

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Well, it's a good thing we 
     didn't live back then, huh?

168
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah, you'd be looking     
pretty much like a whiffle ball

169
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,100
by now, wouldn't ya?

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't believe you guys.

171
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
That's it.                      
I'm leaving.

172
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,400
Come on.               
                    Fine! Fine!

173
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,100
Who needs your kind       
      around here anyway?

174
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,000
Gentlemen!

175
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,500
Now I think that this bar       
is big enough for people

176
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,700
who like <i>The Addams Family</i>      
        and <i>The Munsters.</i>

177
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,300
Okay, all right, fine.

178
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,400
I'll take back what             
I said about Cousin It.

179
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,800
That's okay, it was in 
         the heat of the moment.

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
All right.

181
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
Hey, hey, hey,                  
here's that article

182
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,300
they interviewed        
          Rebecca for.

183
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,200
Look at that.

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,200
Oh, hey, how's              
    her picture?

185
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,500
There isn't
                     one.

186
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,100
Oh, God, it was so crummy       
they didn't even print it.

187
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,200
Oh, wait a minute.

188
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
there it is, right              
there on the back.

189
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
How is it?

190
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,300
ALL:              
              Eww!

191
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,000
Is it that bad?

192
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,000
No, Norm got cheese whiz        
all over the paper.

193
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,100
Actually,               
     the picture's not bad.

194
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Not bad?

195
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
It's great.

196
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,200
Let me see that.

197
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
This is a decent            
    picture of me.

198
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Look at that!

199
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm gorgeous and sexy.

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
And dead as a doornail.

201
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,800
What?

202
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
You're in the obituaries.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Oh, God!

204
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,100
No, don't feel bad, it says   
        you died in bed.

205
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,500
I didn't know you helped        
build the Panama Canal.

206
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,400
Woody, that is someone     
        else's obituary.

207
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
I am not dead.

208
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,500
I am a living,         
     breathing human being.

209
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I know that.

210
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,700
So where'd they put     
        all the dirt, anyway?

211
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,300
Excuse me, can I get      
someone to sign for these?

212
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,300
Yo, right over here.

213
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,700
Let me see these.

214
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,800
Oh, they're from       
         corporate headquarters.

215
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,500
Did we do well last month?

216
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,300
"Dear friends at Cheers,        
we mourn the loss

217
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,700
"of Rebecca Howe.

218
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,300
At last her pain is over."

219
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm going to call them up,
      straighten this out

220
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,600
before they start making
        funeral arrangements.

221
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,900
If I were you,                  
I'd have a closed casket.

222
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,600
Yeah, well, why Grandpa Munster 
    never won an Emmy,

223
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll never know.

224
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,800
Come on, maybe it's because     
he stole his whole character

225
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,100
from Uncle Fester.

226
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, Lord, is this           
    still going on?!

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
This has got to be one of       
    the stupidest arguments

228
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,900
I've ever heard    
             since I started    
             coming to this bar.

229
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,100
Hey, we resent that.

230
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah, why wasn't    
            it <i>the</i> stupidest?

231
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,900
Well, frankly, it lacks     
    meaningless statistics

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,600
and inane historical trivia.

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,900
Say, where is Cliff anyway?

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah, is he still           
    in the hospital?

235
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,900
Uh, I don't know,   
            how's he doing?

236
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
I thought you were          
      going to go see him.

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,900
Well, I tried, I mean, I got   
 as far as the hospital lobby,

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
but you know, the smell of      
alcohol makes me really queasy.

239
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, I, you know, I was gonna 
 go see him, but I got to wait

240
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
until I have a night off here.

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Woody? How about you?

242
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, that's what this string   
      on my finger is for.

243
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,400
What the heck is this one for?

244
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,500
Surely somebody gave him a call

245
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,200
or sent flowers, a card?

246
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,700
Carla?

247
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,300
Yeah, right.

248
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,600
( <i>muttering excuses</i> )

249
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Look, this is terrible!

250
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't you realize

251
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,500
that since Cliff's          
    mother moved to Florida,

252
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,900
we are his sole support group?

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
This desertion         
     in his hour of crisis

254
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,800
could cause him deep      
        emotional scars.

255
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,400
So why didn't  
                 you go see him?

256
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,800
Well, what,                     
I don't have a life?

257
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,100
I think we ought to go
          down there right now

258
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,600
and tell Mr. Clavin   
          how we feel about him.

259
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,500
Don't you think that    
        would be a little cruel?

260
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,600
I mean, the guy       
          just had an operation.

261
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,300
Actually, visiting              
hours are over.

262
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,400
We're going to have             
to wait until tomorrow.         
                        Yeah.

263
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,100
Hey, wait a minute.

264
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,200
Cliff's at New England          
Presbyterian.

265
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,900
That's on my rounds--      
 I have to go by there tonight.

266
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
I can get in to see him.

267
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,800
Well, great, why don't
            you go buy a card

268
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
and date it yesterday,

269
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
sign all our      
              names to it, okay?

270
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Slam dunk.

271
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,100
Is that going to be enough?

272
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Come on, it's just          
        an appendectomy.

273
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
They're taking out          
        a useless organ.

274
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,400
He's chock-full of those.

275
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,900
Ah, excuse me,                  
I'm Dr. Crane.

276
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,300
Uh, where is Mr. Clavin?

277
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,800
He was just discharged.

278
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,100
Oh, great, just my luck.

279
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm the one who gets to run all 
over town to find a stupid card

280
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,700
for the idiot, Clavin, 
         and he isn't even here.

281
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,800
Just a token of     
            how much we care.

282
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
Don't you want                  
to read the card?

283
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,000
I, uh, just         
            forgot my jacket.

284
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Well, you're going to hear it  
         anyway, Cliff.

285
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,900
"Glad you're feeling better.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
"So sorry you were ill.

287
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,800
"If you thought things     
        were bad before,

288
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,900
wait till you get the bill."

289
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, that zesty greeting card  
          humor, huh?

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,200
( <i>chuckling</i> )

291
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,700
Well, gee, Cliff,           
I was just trying to help.

292
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,300
You want to help?

293
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Well, uh, maybe you
             can help with this.

294
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,800
I, uh,

295
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,400
I been doing some   
            soul searching here.

296
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,100
A man gets a lot of     
        time to think with a    
        tube up his nose, and...

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
What I... what I    
         realized is that, uh...

298
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm alone in this world.

299
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,100
I mean, uh, nobody
              came to visit me.

300
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,000
Not one of my so-called
            friends out there

301
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,400
even bothered to    
         walk through that door.

Look, and they all feel terrible
        about it, Cliff.

303

They lead busy lives.

304
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,800
They just couldn't find     
        the time.

305
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on, Doc, cut the   
        malarkey, will you?

306
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,400
They found the time
             to visit Sammy

307
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
when he was     
                in the hospital.

308
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
And Carla when she
              had the twin.

309
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,200
Normie, when he went in
         for the butt tuck...

310
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,100
I know why they
                 didn't visit.

311
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,100
It's because it was me.

312
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
No, Cliff.

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,500
Oh, yeah, come on, Doc.

314
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
They don't like me,    
         they don't really care.

315
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Come on, you can  
              tell me the truth.

316
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,700
Go ahead, right between 
        the eyes, give it to me.

317
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Well, I suppose you're not

          in the bar.

Oh, and you are, huh?

320
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Doc, you suppose                
comments like that

321
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
are part of the problem?

322
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,900
Could be.

323
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,000
God, I don't believe it.

324
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,300

What can I do about it?

332

A little therapy   
             might not be amiss.

333

Oh, no, Doc, isn't there        
something better than therapy?

334
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,600
I mean, you know,               
something

335
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
a little quicker;               
you know, a little easier.

336
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,700
We're talking about a major
     personality change, Cliff.

337
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,200
It's not like you're            
trying to quit smoking.

you reach for a cigarette.

340

Hey, hey, hey, yeah,      
     that's not a bad idea.

341

Now, now, now,                  
just calm down.

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,600
Look, maybe                     
I'm overstating the problem.

343

Maybe all you need to get people
to like you a little better

344
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,600
is just some good,              
old-fashioned politeness.

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Maybe you don't need to take    
any desperate measures.

Oh, yes, he does.

347

I hate that message.

351
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,000
It's not so much        
the content of the message

352
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,000
as the fact that Cliff sings it 
    to the tune of "Volare."

353
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,900
Well, he's got to come back   
        sooner or later.

354
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,400
Look, I suggest         
    that when he does,

355
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,700
we all give him         
      a very warm welcome.

356

Well, all I'm promising     
is not to treat him like a bug.

Well, you see, Carla's willing 
     to go that extra mile.

Hello, Frasier.

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,100
Ah.

Hello, blossom bottom,          
how was your lesson?

361
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
I like driving.

362
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,000
It's a wonderful feeling.

363

Total control of   
             woman over machine.

364
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,400
The speed, the power, the   
    ecstasy-- I was jazzed.

365
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,700
You know,

366
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,500
you're insane.

367
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,800
You're a maniac.

368
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
You're certifiable.

369
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,900
I'm glad to see you're
          talking to me again.

370
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,100
Has your nose       
            stopped bleeding?

371
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,500
Geez, Sam,                      
are you all right?

372
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
No thanks to your wife.

373
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
I cannot believe you made       
that gesture to that guy.

374
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,400
I see people make       
        that gesture to         
        Frasier all the time.

375
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, but Frasier's not driving 
         an 18-wheeler

376
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,200
with a little bumper sticker

377
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,200
that says               
  "Insured by Smith & Wesson."

378
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,700
Well, he cut me off.

379
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,000
That happens all the time.

380
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,500
It doesn't mean         
    that you gun it up to 80

381
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
and run the guy off the road.

382
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,700
I blew his doors
                off, didn't I?

383
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,400
The last thing you want to do  
is stop the car, get out,

384
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
and start poking your finger  
in the folds of his neck.

385
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,100
I wasn't afraid; I thought 
     you could handle him.

386
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah, well, I tried, didn't I?

387
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Oh, yes, that vicious   
        head butt to his fist   
        sent him reeling.

388

                 and have lunch.

            take you for a spin.

Certainly, my dear.

Yeah, lots      
                of luck, Doc.

to every driver and pedestrian 
          on the road.

396
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,800
I'll tell you  
                 something else.

397
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,400
You know,               
    you shouldn't be allowed

398
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,900
to get anywhere near       
     anything with wheels,

399

let me remind you again,

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,200

Come on, Cliff.

Well, it's some harebrained
     scheme I came up with. I...

514
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
When you guys didn't        
    visit me in the hospital,

515
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,000
I... knew it was            
    because I wasn't popular,

516
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,300
so I, uh, went down to     
     this aversion therapy place

517
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,000
and bribed the guy
              to give me a shock

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,500
every time I acted
              like a jerk.

I thought it would make
         me a different person.

I guess                         
it didn't work, huh?
