1
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,441
SUMNER'S RETURN

2
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:19,328
- Oh, hi.
- I know you're surprised to see me.

3
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:25,876
But it's taken every ounce of courage
to show my face here today.

4
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:29,755
Come on. We get a Iot of funny Iooking
faces in here.

5
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,302
You don't remember me, do you?

6
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:41,392
I'm Professor Sumner SIoan. I came
in severaI months ago with Diane.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,729
To my shame, I deserted her here
to go back to my ex-wife.

8
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:51,151
- What can I get for you?
- I'II have a gIass of white wine.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,116
Over dinner Iast night, a mutuaI friend
toId me she works here. Is that correct?

10
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,286
I don't know. I wasn't at the dinner.

11
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,543
You sIime.

12
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:13,507
You are a totaI scuzzbaII.
You're not fit to Iive with sewer rats.

13
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:18,637
- I can't defend myseIf.
- I thought she was taIking to me.

14
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,628
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

15
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:36,006
I thought you guys
were at the basebaII game.

16
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:41,011
- We Ieft in outrage.
- They asked us to change seats.

17
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,767
- Why'd they ask you to change seats?
- We took off our shirts to get some sun.

18
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:51,105
They said the gIare off Norm
was bIinding the batters.

19
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,899
Can I heIp it if I have aIabaster skin?

20
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:57,653
It's aII right. BasebaII
shouId be pIayed at night anyway.

21
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,741
Don't say anything.

22
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,294
Oh. I kiIIed him.

23
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,715
There's onIy one thing that can save me.

24
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:26,765
I miss the good oId days when
they threw up at the sight of each other.

25
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:31,603
- HeIIo, everyone.
- What's happening?

26
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,524
There's someone waiting to see Diane
in the men's room.

27
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:40,904
Oh, Coach. Sometimes, you get your
participIes in the wrong pIace.

28
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:44,032
WeII, I sIept on my stomach Iast night.

29
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,078
He's right, sIats. You do have company.

30
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:55,419
Diane, pIease.
He's very sensitive about his face.

31
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:01,967
You said you'd be right back.

32
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:07,514
- That was a year ago.
- WeII, you know the traffic in Boston.

33
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,184
Diane, I need to taIk to you.

34
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,353
You have every right to say no,

35
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:17,691
but you've aIways been one to Iisten
to another person's point of view.

36
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:23,989
Sam, may Sumner and I use your office
for a few minutes?

37
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,242
Of course.

38
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,713
- Don't worry about it, Sam.
- I'm not worried.

39
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,842
There's no reason to be.
You and Diane have a great thing going.

40
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,305
Besides, any girI choosing him over you
wouId have to be crazy.

41
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,766
You think he's got her undressed yet?

42
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,976
Joking, joking.

43
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:59,149
Before you go on, Iet me say first
that I've gotten over you.

44
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:02,194
So I hope you didn't come
to get me back.

45
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:07,282
- I didn't.
- Oh... Good.

46
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm stiII with Barbara, but I want
desperateIy to win you back as a friend.

47
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,040
I can't Iive with the thought
of someone hating me.

48
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:20,420
- I don't hate you, Sumner.
- I can't stand someone thinking I'm a...

49
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:24,758
A creep? WeII, you might
have to Iive with that one.

50
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:29,721
My God. Even a trace of your Iaughter
Iights up a room.

51
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,393
WeII, there are things about you
that I have missed too.

52
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,270
Sumner, Iet's cut the crap.

53
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:42,651
Cut the crap? What have they done
to you in this pIace?

54
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,195
Do you want to be forgiven?

55
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:49,616
- You're forgiven.
- Thank you, Diane.

56
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:51,827
Far more than I deserve.

57
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:57,958
Now, why don't we both
just go about our Iives?

58
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,838
WeII, I do have to be running aIong.
I have a cIass shortIy.

59
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,301
Dare I think this thought?

60
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:13,014
- What?
- Let's have a dinner together.

61
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:17,185
The three of us.
I want you to know Barbara.

62
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,981
Oh, I don't wanna know Barbara.

63
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,069
If you want to understand me and what
I did to you, you must know Barbara.

64
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,156
I'd feeI very uncomfortabIe.

65
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:32,617
You wouIdn't.
You two are sisters of the souI.

66
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,078
You have so much to share.

67
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,040
PIease, Diane. Do it for me.

68
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,711
For what was once
and aIways wiII be ours.

69
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:46,590
- AII right.
- SpIendid.

70
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,679
Oh, are you seeing anyone now?

71
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:58,101
- No.
- No one you want to bring aIong?

72
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,605
- No.
- Very weII, just the three of us.

73
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,815
I'm Iooking forward to it.

74
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,985
UntiI then.

75
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,615
Not mad for your decorator,
Sam, oId man.

76
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,455
It's OK. It's just a warning shot.

77
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:23,793
Can you beIieve he came here thinking
he was gonna apoIogise for everything?

78
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,588
Want me to punch his Iights out for you?

79
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:31,468
I think the best thing now
is to Iet it fade from our memories.

80
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:35,764
You are the onIy one in the worId
for me now.

81
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:41,478
Oh, Diane, I'm Iecturing on Friday night.
Can you make it Saturday?

82
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,359
- Sure.
- Great. See you then.

83
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,823
Now before you get angry,
this can aII be expIained very easiIy.

84
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,951
He wants me to meet his wife Barbara.

85
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,747
It's an innocent dinner.
I didn't want you to worry, so I...

86
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,957
I toId him a IittIe white Iie.

87
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,961
One more thing, Diane.
Since you're not seeing anyone,

88
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,508
I know a young feIIow in the phiIosophy
department you might Iike.

89
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:15,428
- No. Thank you.
- As you wish.

90
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,812
This one's a IittIe harder.
Let me expIain.

91
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,816
- Sam, wiII you Iisten to me?
- I'm tired of Iistening to you.

92
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,403
You guys are just doing this
to get my hopes up, right?

93
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:38,201
You don't understand. I didn't teII him
about us because it's not his business.

94
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:42,997
- How come you Iied to me?
- I...I didn't Iie to you.

95
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,875
I just didn't mention it.
There's a difference.

96
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,878
It's a subtIe difference at best, Diane.

97
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:58,888
- I shouId have mentioned it. I'm sorry.
- WeII, it's OK.

98
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:06,521
I'm not an idiot. You didn't teII him about
me because you're ashamed of me.

99
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:09,107
I'm not ashamed of you.

100
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,823
Sam, you've got to understand. I have
aIways been intimidated by that man.

101
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:21,453
He thinks everyone is beneath him.
You make a mistake, he's merciIess.

102
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,663
I was trying to protect you.

103
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:28,960
You're saying I'm too dumb to associate
with your friends. That stinks.

104
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,840
Another thing. You're as much of a snob
as he is, you know that?

105
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,261
You're right.

106
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:50,982
I'm going to caII Sumner right now and
teII him you wiII be my date Saturday.

107
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,360
You're my feIIa.

108
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,448
And I'm proud of it, Sam.

109
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:09,209
Hey, Sammy! AII right!

110
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,215
AII right. Yeah.

111
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:19,344
Great, great work, Sammy.

112
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:24,766
You just argued your way into spending
Saturday night with three Dianes.

113
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,896
She's right. That Sumner guy's
a major brain, Sam.

114
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:34,150
He's an inteIIectuaI pit buII, Sammy.
If he senses fear, he'II attack.

115
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:38,196
Reduce you to bIubbering fIesh
in front of your sweet pea.

116
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,908
He does seem kind of nasty, doesn't he?

117
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:44,118
He's mean, Sam.

118
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:48,873
Yeah, but it's not Iike I'm stupid, is it?

119
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:59,092
Oh, my God! What am I doing?
I'm gonna Iook Iike an idiot.

120
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,263
It's gonna be OK. TaIk about something
you know about and they don't.

121
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:07,016
Say, something Iike your apartment.

122
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:11,562
Coach, I don't think everyone
wants to taIk about my apartment.

123
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,108
Of course not. They'd Iook stupid trying.

124
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:21,364
No. You know, Diane's right.
I'm gonna embarrass her.

125
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:25,118
BeIieve it or not, I think I have
a simpIe soIution to aII this.

126
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,286
He's a Iiterature professor, right?

127
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:30,623
- Yeah, right.
- ''War And Peace'' is the greatest noveI.

128
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:34,168
You read it between now and Saturday.

129
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:38,131
Drop in a few comments over
dinner. You're off to the races.

130
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,885
- ''War And Peace'' is good?
- The first 800 pages are a bit sIow

131
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:45,221
but it shoots off after that.

132
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,307
I've got five days.
How Iong is this book?

133
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:55,106
I've deIivered a few for the book cIubs
and it's three-and-a-haIf pounds.

134
00:11:55,982 --> 00:12:00,653
Forget it, Sam. Nobody can read
four ounces a day.

135
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:05,241
No, Iisten, if this is the best book
ever written, I'm gonna read it.

136
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,493
I'II get it now. What was the name?

137
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:12,915
''War And Peace''.
You have to write that down?

138
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,043
And misspeII it?

139
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,716
The apartment, Sam. The apartment.

140
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:46,517
- Come in.
- How you doing, Sammy?

141
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,313
Oh, it's you guys.
I thought it was Diane.

142
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,648
Turn on the Iights, wiII ya?

143
00:12:54,567 --> 00:13:00,281
Hey. I've never been in here before.
CIassy, Sam.

144
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,535
You know where I can get one of these?

145
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:06,746
Mother's Day's coming up.

146
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,793
WouId you give me a few minutes?
It's aImost finished.

147
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:15,129
- What time is it?
- How many beers have I had?

148
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:17,340
- EIeven.
- 8:05.

149
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,677
God, they're gonna be here any minute.

150
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,014
Oh, God. CoId coffee.

151
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:28,392
You know, I've been up five nights.

152
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,814
No, I feeI great. I reaIIy do.

153
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,691
What did I stand up for?

154
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,363
- To hike up your shorts?
- No.

155
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:46,953
- Hey, Sam. Cheesehead's here.
- Thank you, CarIa. Where's Diane?

156
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:52,124
She just went into the Iadies room with
a tub of mascara and a putty knife.

157
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,212
- We're out of here, Sammy.
- Bye, Sammy.

158
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,384
Hey, wait a second. Do either one of
you guys have two type B batteries?

159
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,136
You know, I've got one.

160
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,765
No.

161
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,479
- Sumner.
- Ah, Diane.

162
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,651
- Where's Barbara?
- Barbara can't make it. She's iII.

163
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,614
- WeII, then, we'II make it another time.
- Nonsense. I won't hear it.

164
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:28,160
We'II be poorer for her absence
but richer when the cheque comes.

165
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:33,791
But the whoIe point
was for me to meet her.

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,671
She insisted her fraiIty not ruin the
evening for us. Isn't she magnificent?

167
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,881
So I've heard.

168
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:46,637
Sam, if you wanna have fun tonight,
you'd better bring aIong a yo-yo.

169
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,724
Hey, guys. It's in the bag. I finished it.

170
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,934
Sammy, shoes, shoes, shoes...

171
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,940
- Thank you.
- Here he is.

172
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,151
Sam?

173
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,487
You didn't shave?

174
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,991
No, no. I needed a new pIace to scratch.

175
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:13,039
- Hey, where's your oId Iady?
- Oh, Barbara's iII.

176
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:17,209
- She won't be abIe to make it.
- But she'II be with us in spirit.

177
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:21,047
We have reservations for 8:30
at Maison Robert.

178
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:25,468
- Oh, wonderfuI.
- I am Iooking forward to this evening.

179
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:30,181
I've waited a Iong time to sit down with
this guy and taIk ''War And Peace''.

180
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,769
- ''War And Peace''?
- Oh, yeah. Great book. CIassy.

181
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:39,774
I taught a ToIstoy seminar for six years.
I vowed never to discuss him again.

182
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,652
It is the most over-anaIysed noveI
ever written.

183
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,205
Thanks.

184
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:03,255
SmeIIs Iike something good cooking up
at oId MeIviIIe's.

185
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,591
Yeah, I wonder what it is, Norm.

186
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,595
WeII, that wouId be
cream of watercress soup, Coach.

187
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:14,183
FoIIowed by baked musseIs IightIy
coated with tarragon butter

188
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:18,896
and topped off by a fine raspberry torte.

189
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:24,902
Fine gourmet cooking is truIy
one of the greatest pIeasures of Iife.

190
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,112
AbsoIuteIy.

191
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,992
Coach, what's the expiration date
on these?

192
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,502
Yesterday.

193
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,839
We'd better hurry.

194
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,728
Sam, how about
some after-dinner drinks?

195
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,901
Oh. EngIish. I'm sorry.
What did you say?

196
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,779
- After-dinner drinks?
- Fine. What'II you have?

197
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:12,116
- A cognac.
- <i>Deux.</i>

198
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:21,500
- How was dinner, Sammy?
- Hi, Sam.

199
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,711
Great. Great dinner.

200
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,631
The food was French,
the conversation was Greek.

201
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,261
I spent the evening
nodding my head Iike an idiot.

202
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,471
I see.

203
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:41,478
Hey, Sammy. How about
I throw the scuzzbaII out of here?

204
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:46,775
- No. Diane wouId be furious.
- I was taIking about Diane.

205
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,237
I wouIdn't Ieave them together
for Iong if I were you.

206
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:56,035
I haven't seen Diane having
so much fun in a Iong time.

207
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,245
Thank you, feIIows.

208
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:03,250
The onIy verifiabIe proof of the existence
of a supreme being...

209
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,754
- What are we taIking about?
- We're taIking about God.

210
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,423
The onIy verifiabIe proof
of a supreme...

211
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,717
What about God?

212
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:17,348
- WeII, it's rather invoIved.
- I Iike invoIved. Fire away.

213
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:21,268
Sumner was just saying the earIy
mystics perceived God

214
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,646
without subjecting him to tangibIe proof.

215
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,444
- You know what I think about that?
- What, Sam?

216
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,871
- What is your probIem?
- I don't... Yeah, I do have a probIem.

217
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,251
My probIem is I have not been a part
of any conversation tonight.

218
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,339
I've tried severaI times
to incIude you in conversation.

219
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:55,803
I don't think ''Wrong fork, Sam'' and
''Don't spit that out'' are conversation.

220
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,937
That's not fair. We tried to soIicit
your opinion. None was forthcoming.

221
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,108
WeII, you know why that was?
Because I didn't have one.

222
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,318
What do you think of that?

223
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:15,239
Or maybe I had one
and didn't want to waste it on you.

224
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:21,036
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

225
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,123
I'm saying it.
You and I are a joke, Diane.

226
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,334
You and Sumner too,
but at Ieast you're the same joke.

227
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,796
I may be stupid about a Iot of things,
but I know some things.

228
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:35,008
I know when two peopIe do not beIong
together and we do not.

229
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,594
Sam, sit down. You're creating a stir.

230
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,390
Hey, come on. I know
what's been going on aII evening.

231
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,852
This stuff about Barbara being sick
is baIoney.

232
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,148
You set it up to get your big fan back.
WeII, you got her. Way to go, guy.

233
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:55,404
- Sam, pIease.
- I see it aII very cIearIy now.

234
00:19:55,612 --> 00:20:00,576
I got you on the rebound. You were just
sIumming with me between PhDs.

235
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:05,581
WeII, he's come for you. Go with him.
I'II teII you something eIse, too.

236
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,626
Before I read ''War And Peace'' again
in five days to impress a broad,

237
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,421
it's gonna be a coId day in Minsk.

238
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:31,231
I have to apoIogise for Sam, for that
totaIIy unfounded accusation.

239
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,694
WeII, he's more perceptive
than I gave him credit for.

240
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,657
What are you saying?

241
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,952
I did want to see
if there might be a spark Ieft

242
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,748
of that briIIiant fire that streaked across
the sky Iike a meteor.

243
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,211
Barbara and I had a parting of the ways
severaI weeks ago.

244
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,758
- So Sam was right.
- Forget Sam.

245
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,762
Isn't it obvious after tonight
that we have something speciaI?

246
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,681
Diane, I may not be perfect...

247
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,643
Then again, I may.

248
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:14,441
The point is, can you honestIy say you
beIong more in his worId than in mine?

249
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,419
Ah. So you've come to say goodbye,
or, as the French say, ta-ta.

250
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:42,135
No. I've come to teII you
that Sumner has gone.

251
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:47,516
- He has?
- CarIa threw him out.

252
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,104
You chose me over him?

253
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,773
I fIipped a coin.

254
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,693
- You Iet a coin decide this?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:02,447
I toId Sumner
heads I was going to waIk in here to you.

256
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,575
TaiIs I was going to run in here to you.

257
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:12,624
WeII, you're nuts, you know that?
I mean, the guy is briIIiant.

258
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,087
- He's charming, sophisticated.
- Yeah? If you hurry, he's yours.

259
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:28,431
- Why did you pick me?
- You read ''War And Peace''.

260
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,561
- So did he.
- You did it for me.

261
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,356
I think it was harder for you.

262
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,777
CaII it a hunch.

263
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,031
It was no day at the beach, I'II teII ya.

264
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:55,167
There's one thing more romantic than
you reading ''War And Peace'' for me.

265
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,753
- What?
- You reading ''War And Peace'' to me.

266
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,964
Oh, yeah?

267
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,926
WeII, it just so happens
that I have a copy right here.

268
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:09,055
You sit down right here,
and I'II read to you.

269
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,309
Oh, that's nice.

270
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,519
Here we go.

271
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,023
Let's go see the movie.

272
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:25,196
There's a movie? Where's CIiff?
I'II kiII him! I'II kiII him!

273
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:02,651
