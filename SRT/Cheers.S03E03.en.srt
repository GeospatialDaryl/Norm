1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,714
l CALL YOUR NAME

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,755
What can l say?
l just remembered, this isn't my night off.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,957
We'll have to cut
this lovely evening short.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,749
- l wish you'd told me sooner.
- l did, over dinner.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,230
You didn't hear me
over the oompah-pah band

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,312
and the noise of you chewing bratwurst.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,478
l've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,715
- RV show tickets aren't easy to get.
- Please, Eddie. l'm torn up enough.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,679
Coach...

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,197
- You like RVs, mobile homes?
- l don't know much about them.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,079
- Like to learn?
- l was meaning to.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,028
Coach, meet Eddie. Eddie. Coach.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,034
He's got tickets to the RV show tonight.
How's that sound?

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,156
- Terrific.
- l'll cover for you.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,878
Hot dog!

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,788
Some luck!

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,318
- l guess l won't get a good night kiss.
- You might if you're nice to him.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,838
l can't wait. Do they let you
walk through those things?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,595
- Yeah, if you take your shoes off.
- OK.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,156
Not now.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,110
- Jerk.
- Yeah?

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,077
For once it's not you. Mr Fancy Bottom
feels his martini isn't dry enough.

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,552
Well, do you want me to kill him for you,
Diane?

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,473
lt's too good for him.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,396
Come on, lighten up.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,154
This is a bar.
People come here to have a good time.

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,677
- Yeah, don't you just hate them for it?
- What's wrong?

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,116
l'm having a bad day.
Can l have a bad day?

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,955
You've given us plenty.
Keep one for yourself.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,516
l hope it's to your satisfaction.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,037
We aspire to make every customer
a happy customer.

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,350
lt's still not dry enough.

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,397
Drink it!

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,551
Say, excuse me, folks.

35
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,713
She gets a little upset still,
ever since l dumped her.

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,832
Let me do this. Coach!
The driest martini in town, on the house.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,594
- Right.
- Please, forgive her.

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,073
She's a firebrand. l spend half my day
apologising to nice customers like you.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,633
- Carla, l'm in no mood.
- We're talking about someone else.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,150
One vodka rocks.

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,913
- ls there anything l can do?
- No.

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,516
This problem is between
myself and Frasier Crane.

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,958
Suffice to say he insists on
making mountains out of molehills.

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,190
He wants you to wear a padded bra?

45
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,836
Go mate with a squid.

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,435
Please forgive her again.

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,512
She spent time in an institution recently.

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,714
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Hey, Cliffie.

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,075
Can you believe those Sox?

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,110
l miss those carefree halcyon days
when my only concern was baseball.

51
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,748
Cliffie, got something on your mind?

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,358
l saw a fellow postal employee remove
a fragrance sample from a magazine.

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,473
- So?
- lt's against employee regulations.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,077
lt's a smudge on every mail carrier
who ever donned this uniform.

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,595
- So?
- So?

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,716
On one hand, l don't want to be a snitch.

57
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,678
But, on the other,
l can't endorse anarchy.

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,593
- What should l do?
- Compromise, have a beer.

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,911
l see l should look elsewhere
for help on this.

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,596
- Diane, l've got a little problem here.
- Who doesn't?

61
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,354
Valid, valid.

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,636
Well, l guess my choice is clear.

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,076
l must follow my conscience
and report this.

64
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,994
Come on, man. lt's a fragrance sample.
Let it go.

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,188
Let it go? l let this go and tomorrow
Hitler is in the White House.

66
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,998
l can do without that.

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,675
Sure, it's only a perfume sample,

68
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,833
but if he gets away with it,
the others will start taking things, too.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,788
First, whole magazines go missing.
Then social security cheques.

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,593
Before long, Grandma's fruitcake doesn't
make it to little Bobby, Peggy and Sue.

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,629
Their little hearts will break,
thinking Grandma forgot them this year.

72
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,873
What are those little green things
in a fruitcake, Cliff?

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,476
They look like parts of tyres.

74
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,274
- You're getting a little off the point.
- You brought it up, Cliffie.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,670
Who is this menace to society?

76
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,832
Do you remember Lewis,
that fella l brought in here?

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,719
- Enormous black gentleman?
- That's the one.

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,279
Cliff!

79
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,592
Come on, l'd think twice before
crossing Lewis. lt could be dangerous.

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,070
He's not the kind of guy who drinks tea
with his pinkie sticking out.

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,357
Please, Sam, there are ladies present.

82
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,951
- l'm sorry, Coach.
- Thank you.

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,719
l guess the bottom line
is that it'd be snitching.

84
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,156
- l like to think l'm a little above that.
- Absolutely.

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,039
What's that? You announcing
the birth of yet another child?

86
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,198
- Or are you implying something?
- You'd rat on a little guy.

87
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,710
- Yeah? l'm going to rat on this guy, too.
- Don't let Carla goad you into this.

88
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,759
Sammy, as long as l wear this uniform,
l have a duty to fulfil.

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,957
l'll speak my truth
and take the consequences.

90
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,156
- Supervisor, please.
- Come on, Cliff.

91
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,032
l don't care about the risk. The voice
of Clifford Clavin is going to be heard.

92
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,751
Hello, hang on to your yockstrap.
l have a terrible thing to report.

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,675
- Good night.
- Night, Cliffie.

94
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,231
Cliff. You want to spend
the night in my office?

95
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,270
- You still think l'm afraid, don't you?
- Yumpin' yimminy, no.

96
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,792
That Swedish accent
was just for the amusement of the bar.

97
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,190
l don't care if Lewis finds out it was me.

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,195
ln fact, if l ever see the guy again,
l'll tell him it was me and clear the air.

99
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,515
You're the man l'm looking for.

100
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,232
- l've been fired!
- l'm sorry! God, l'm terribly sorry.

101
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,837
You're taking this worse than l am.
l just want to find out who did it.

102
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,317
- Did what?
- Someone called the supervisor

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,031
and squealed on me for taking
a perfume sample out of a magazine.

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,475
He fired you for that?

105
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,235
What kind of a chicken outfit
do we work for?

106
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,313
You smell divine.
What are you wearing?

107
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,153
Giorgio for Men.

108
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,553
Who could blame you?
lt's perfect for you.

109
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,439
- Sorry l can't help you out.
- You can.

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,229
Know how you stick your nose
in people's business at the post office?

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,311
You're nosy!

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,109
- l want to know who did it by tomorrow.
- OK, pal.

113
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,874
Be here at 7:00 and don't be late.

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,477
Be here at 7:00 and don't be late
cos l'll have that information.

115
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,154
l know you will.

116
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,715
Lewis?

117
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,269
Thanks for thinking of me.

118
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,430
- Tomorrow l die.
- Come on, now.

119
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,229
The guy is going to beat
the living hell out of me.

120
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,391
No use saying l don't deserve it.

121
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,120
- Nobody did.
- Thanks, Carla.

122
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,953
- Coach, let's go home.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,795
Can l play my French language tapes
on the way home?

124
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,474
No. We hear them every night.
l'm sick of it.

125
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,598
- They're not doing any good.
- They are.

126
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,637
Say ''How are you today?''
in French.

127
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,553
How are you today?
ln French.

128
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,154
- l rest my case.
- l rest my case.

129
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,118
- Knock it off.
- Knock it off.

130
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,192
- Frasier.
- Hi, Sam.

131
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,033
Diane left about 1 5 minutes ago.

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,317
Darn. Guess l'll go to her house
to shoot the breeze.

133
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,040
Diane is more like a monsoon.

134
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,149
Yes, her breeze is like a monsoon.

135
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,436
Good night.

136
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,429
- Want to come in and have a beer?
- l wouldn't want to impose.

137
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,636
OK, good night.

138
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,076
This is fun.

139
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,833
l've got time for bar room chatter.
Might do the old boy good.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,558
Maybe.

141
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,998
Well, l'll have a tankard
of your finest lager.

142
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,553
l understand the local Boston Red Sox
baseball franchise

143
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,871
has a Herculean task to qualify
for the post-season tournament.

144
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,156
Yeah, they really stink this year.

145
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,397
Stink? lnteresting theory.

146
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,077
While we're on the subject of Boston
and the world and all of its people,

147
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
l have this patient. Let's call him...

148
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,475
Give him any old name. Thor.

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,479
For the first time in my career,
l can't solve this problem.

150
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,029
But it occurs to me that you might.

151
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,158
You want my opinion
on one of your patients?

152
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,871
Believe it or not, psychiatrists
value input from outside the profession.

153
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,112
l'd like the benefit of your experience.
You know women.

154
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,874
l mean, your sexual exploits

155
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,319
could be thought of
as a majestic panoramic mural.

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,314
- And Thor's...?
- A silly little doodle.

157
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,029
All right. What the hell?

158
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,548
What's his problem?

159
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,871
Thor's girlfriend, let's call her...

160
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,554
Electra...

161
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,348
cried out another man's name
during the act of love.

162
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,673
- Oh, Thor. Ouch.
- Precisely.

163
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,594
So, Sam, tell me.
You've been with a lot of women.

164
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,990
When you were with one of them,

165
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,594
did she ever call out
another man's name?

166
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,150
l don't think so, but then who listens?

167
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,429
Usually l've got the stereo turned up
and other things on my mind.

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,953
Tell me, whose name
did Electra call out?

169
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,830
- An old boyfriend's.
- Double ouch.

170
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,629
Although they've decided it
means nothing, which it doesn't,

171
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,917
Thor doesn't seem
to be able to get over it.

172
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,676
So if Thor came to you,
what would you tell him?

173
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,674
The truth, that it happens all the time.

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,434
- Really?
- lt happens to all guys.

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,878
ln fact, l just remembered
it's happened to me before, lots of times.

176
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,952
l turned the stereo up because of that.

177
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,872
Really?

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,675
Well, thank you, Sam.
l'll pass that along to...

179
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,833
- Thor.
- Right. lt's getting late.

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,309
Thanks for the cold one, Sam.

181
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,994
The beer, l mean, not Diane.

182
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,796
Two sips of liquor
and l'm a jack-a-ninny.

183
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,469
- Lewis will be here any minute.
- What's your plan?

184
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,949
Plan? l have no plan.

185
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,510
Unless honesty and
straightforwardness are a plan.

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,831
No, l meant your medical plan.

187
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,354
Your humour's falling on deaf ears.

188
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,957
Good, you won't miss them
when Lewis rips them off your head.

189
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,873
Sam.

190
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,593
Sam?

191
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,512
Barkeep.

192
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,719
l'm sorry, Diane. Do you want me?

193
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,353
Actually, l want two Becks.

194
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,830
Guess l didn't hear you
calling out my name.

195
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,591
ls something amusing you
that l don't know about?

196
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,228
No, why do you ask?

197
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,676
That stupid look on your face.

198
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,991
Do l need a reason to look stupid?

199
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,275
You have the best reason of all.

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,355
OK, Clavin, you know why l'm here.

201
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,198
- Who is it?
- Lewis...

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,909
l've written a man's name
on a piece of paper in this envelope.

203
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,389
- Good.
- Before you look at it,

204
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,232
let me tell you something about him.

205
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,789
ls this ''The Dating Game''?

206
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,269
The man whose name is in this envelope

207
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,830
bears no animosity towards you
or any living thing.

208
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,389
He's a man who loves his country.

209
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,554
He did it out of a sense of duty towards
America, God and all that we cherish.

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,393
One other thing. The man who did this
is terribly sorry. Please forgive him.

211
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,353
OK. l've got another job anyway.

212
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,877
lf l saw that name, l'd get so angry
l might do something stupid.

213
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,996
Go on. Open it.

214
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,470
l can't tell you how proud l am

215
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,598
to see you overcome
your need for vengeance.

216
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,478
Tell that fellow he's real lucky
he's still in one piece.

217
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
He knows it, Lewis.

218
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,748
You'd better.

219
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,678
You really showed me something there.

220
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,755
That was more than just stupidity.
There was a trace of bravery in there.

221
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,960
- Way to go, Cliff.
- Thanks.

222
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,396
All right, who's Juan Torrez?

223
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,198
- There must be some mistake.
- No. There's a map to his house.

224
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,670
l knew he wasn't
going to look in that thing.

225
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,674
Besides, he knows it was me.
So what's the big deal?

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,949
He'd never hit Juan. He's in a body cast.
He fell out of a window.

227
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,315
- What?
- What what?

228
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,633
Don't be coy. lt doesn't go
with the sloping forehead.

229
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,633
Did l tell you
your boyfriend stopped by?

230
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,678
- What's his name?
- You know very well it's Frasier.

231
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,196
Frasier, right!
That's an easy name to forget.

232
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,673
- How are you two doing?
- Fine.

233
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,877
- ls there something on your mind?
- No, why do you ask?

234
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,908
lf there's a spot on an empty canvas,
it tends to stand out.

235
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,437
No, if l had something to say, l'd say it.

236
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,715
l'd even yell it out.

237
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,836
Passionately.

238
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,433
What did you and Frasier talk about?

239
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,036
Let's drop this whole thing.
lt's going nowhere.

240
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,033
We both have more important work
to get back to.

241
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,873
l know l'm running a little behind.

242
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,797
You're smug.
You think you have something on me.

243
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,997
- l emphasise 'think'.
- l'm not thinking.

244
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,072
No, but this is as close as you get.

245
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,593
Come on. Why don't you
stop this silly little game

246
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,116
and admit you're still crazy about me?

247
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,714
You're the one who always brings it up.

248
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,112
lf anybody's crazy about anybody,
you're crazy about me.

249
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,751
l'm not saying ''Sam''
when l'm in bed with Frasier.

250
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,228
l'll kill him! l'll kill you!

251
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,312
- Then l'll kill myself.
- You're overreacting.

252
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,869
There's no need to kill me.

253
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,870
- Hello.
- Hello, your buttocks! Get in here!

254
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,033
- You seem agitated.
- l don't know who l hate the most.

255
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,192
That's not bad.
Only two months and you're tied with me.

256
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,908
- How could you tell him?
- l didn't. He must have deduced it.

257
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,389
Oh, please.

258
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,317
Come on, l'm good at deducement.

259
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,268
- How could you betray my confidence?
- You didn't say no telling.

260
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,831
l see. Obviously l made the mistake
of treating you as an adult.

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,073
- Why tell him anything to begin with?
- l was hoping for some insight.

262
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,478
lnsight!

263
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,632
From a man whose idea
of intellectual stimulation

264
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,030
is to count along with Big Bird?

265
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,070
ln his arrogance, he thought that when
l called out ''Sam'', l was referring to him.

266
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,676
- And you weren't?
- No!

267
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,400
lt was a different Sam entirely.

268
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,154
lt was...Sam Goldwyn.

269
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,751
His movies always
gave me great pleasure.

270
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,311
Diane, Sam, please.
Let's not go on this way.

271
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,075
Now it's out in the open,
let's face it and admit the truth.

272
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,028
- What are you talking about?
- There's still a spark between you two.

273
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,116
lt's best that l step aside and allow it
to either ignite or extinguish itself.

274
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,477
Frasier, look into my eyes.

275
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,074
You are the man in my life.

276
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,437
There is no longer anything
between Sam and l.

277
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,239
You'll see the same thing in his eyes.

278
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,548
Can't l just tell him?

279
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,556
Do it, Sam.

280
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,314
There's nothing going on between us.
lt's all over between me and Diane.

281
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,395
- l believe you.
- Frasier, thank God!

282
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,393
- How could you have doubted me?
- l don't know.

283
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,552
l really haven't been myself
these last few days.

284
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,872
What do you say we take a weekend off
and go someplace together?

285
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,996
Yes, let's.

286
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,709
l'd better go.
l'm late for my marital relations group.

287
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,998
And, thanks. l'd like to apologise
to you both for flying off the handle.

288
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,790
lt just shows that
even psychiatrists get the blues.

289
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,076
Diane, see you later.

290
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,071
- Sam.
- Yeah?

291
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,198
- Go Red Sox.
- Ra!

292
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,231
What actors we are, Sam.

293
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,911
- l'm amazed we could pull that off.
- Pull what off?

294
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,631
Fooling a man so versed
in human behaviour.

295
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,871
There is a spark, isn't there, Sam?

296
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,959
Well...

297
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,795
Gee...

298
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,998
l don't think it would take
much encouragement

299
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,835
to turn it into an inferno.

300
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,074
Maybe you're right.

301
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,677
Sam, let's stop stopping ourselves.
Let's let it happen.

302
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,832
Happen. Happen, yeah.

303
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,476
- Oh, Diane...
- Frasier!

304
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,558
Oh, yeah?

305
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,278
Well, ha ha!

306
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,435
English ( en)
