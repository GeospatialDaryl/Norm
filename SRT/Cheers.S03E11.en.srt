1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,839
WHODUNlT

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,070
OK, folks.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,791
Just to help you pass time
while you're waiting for a table upstairs,

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,114
l will show you a trick that leaves
people with their mouths wide open.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,831
l'm going to guess your age
by asking three simple questions. OK?

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,996
- Sounds like fun.
- Good.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,312
OK, first question.
What year were you born?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,950
- You're kidding?
- Bare with me, will you?

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,035
1 949.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,875
OK, second question.
How much do you weigh?

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,240
About 1 85 pounds.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,033
OK, third and last question.
What do you do for a living?

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,556
l'm a carpet salesman.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,637
OK, l should have an answer for you
right after dinner.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,228
- After dinner?
- Yeah, l forgot to carry a number.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,191
Four, six and seven...

17
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,358
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,149
- What would you like?
- Got anything pale and cold?

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,471
Yeah, but it's Diane's day off.

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,074
l'll have a beer then, l guess.

21
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,153
You look a little glum, buddy.
Do you have a problem?

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,438
My new boss just chewed me out.
He says l lack enthusiasm.

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,512
Well, is that true?

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,150
l don't know. l guess. Who cares?

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,276
Well, here it is, Dr Ludlow.

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,956
lt was Diane's idea to expose you
to Boston's seamy underbelly.

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,557
Frasier, Dr Ludlow will enjoy
a quaint little Boston pub.

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
l wonder who the guy is with them.

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,034
A talent scout for a geek show.

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,237
l wish that l'd worn a heavier overcoat.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,870
- l had no idea it would be so chilly.
- l apologise.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,349
You're apologising for the weather?

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,035
Yes, and the fact that
l've had this toasty garment.

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,079
- Why don't you wear it?
- We're not exactly the same size.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,515
- l'm sorry.
- Stop apologising.

36
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,875
That's all right. l don't mind.

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,554
- Frasier...
- l'm sorry.

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,395
l turn to jelly in the presence
of my mentor, Dr Ludlow.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,553
This attitude was all right
when you were in my programme,

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,676
but we are peers now.

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,391
Did you hear that, Diane? Peers.
Ludlow, get us some brandies!

42
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,313
No, l'm just kidding. l'll get them.

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,996
- Diane, could you give me a hand?
- Certainly. Excuse me.

44
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,030
- Did you notice?
- Of course.

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,715
- What are we going to do about it?
- lgnore it.

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,112
lgnore it? That's like telling me
to ignore your fly being open.

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,635
Yes, very good point.

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,035
lt isn't, is it?

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,116
What's the problem here?

50
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,670
My colleague has
dropped a crumb during dinner

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,718
and it has become encrusted on his tie.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,510
So? You could take Norm's tie,
put it in a kettle and make soup.

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,674
lncidentally, the tie was invented
in ancient times to be used as a bib.

54
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,675
- You know, to wipe your chin.
- They're thinking of changing that?

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,115
Why not just tell the guy?

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,431
Why didn't we come
to Sam in the first place?

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,674
You don't say ''there's a spot'' to a man
of the stature of Dr Bennett Ludlow.

58
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,559
The Bennett Ludlow?

59
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,188
- You've heard of him, Coach?
- No.

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,910
He's one of the giants of psychiatry.
Author, innovator, educator,

61
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,548
and my idol and inspiration.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,030
Lean over and pretend
to admire his tie tack,

63
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,590
and just nibble the morsel off real quick.

64
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,673
- Who's the wiser?
- Sam is right. We have to tell him.

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,310
Of course you're right.
May we have three brandies?

66
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,029
l should tell him.
l suggested beef Wellington.

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,398
Beef Wellington, you say?
Where's that tie? Show me.

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,516
l'll just have to tell him

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,990
in a subtle way
that will preserve his dignity.

70
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,357
Hey, pigpen! What's that thing?
Are you trying to catch pigeons?

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,118
Thank you.

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,398
Don't mention it. l like a man
who wears his dinner with pride.

73
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,158
Here. Sir, it may cause you
some personal embarrassment,

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,276
but you have a spot...

75
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,952
...in my heart.

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,078
- Always will.
- Thank you, Frasier.

77
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,119
lf you'll excuse me,
l've got a telephone call to make.

78
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,752
Believe me, l am not the sort of man
who approaches young ladies

79
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,595
and tries to be more familiar
by using some smooth line.

80
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,228
Your secret is safe with me.

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,356
Pardon me for saying this,

82
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,069
but something about you
is so strikingly attractive.

83
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,711
While you're stare at my zoomers,
let's see if we can figure it out.

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,159
- How can l get your telephone number?
- A phone book.

85
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,678
Would you tell me your name
or shall l check under ''Hot Babe''?

86
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,554
The name is Carla Tortelli
and l'm starting to like you.

87
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,556
- Say, Norm?
- Yes, Cliff?

88
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,553
You seem to have a spot on your tie.

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,275
So l do, so l do.
Thank you for pointing that out.

90
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,954
lf more people were as conscientious,

91
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,112
we could wipe out
social embarrassment.

92
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,236
Don't thank me, Norm.

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,518
Periodic tie checks are the duty
of every American citizen.

94
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,590
- Did he look at his tie?
- No.

95
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,513
So much for subtlety. All right.

96
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,116
You start a fire for diversion.
l'll hose him down.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,598
- Boy, am l exhausted.
- Not much sleep?

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,716
No, l slept like a baby.

99
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,431
lt's just that l dreamed
l had insomnia all night.

100
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,315
Someday that man's head
will open up and a prize will pop out.

101
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,878
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, Carla.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,349
- l got some flowers here.
- For me?

103
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,476
Very cute, Carla.

104
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,394
You've had flowers
every day for two weeks.

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,996
Yeah, l guess l ought to be feeling guilty.

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,154
l'm getting all these flowers
and there are bees going hungry.

107
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,279
We're kind of curious here.
Who's your secret admirer?

108
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,599
- lt's none of your damn business.
- Thank you, Carla.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,151
- What did she say?
- None of your damn business.

110
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,471
Well, excuse me for living.

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,031
What if l said that when you asked me
how to throw a knuckleball?

112
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,749
- You did.
- So we're even.

113
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,839
Frasier, you're early.

114
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,389
- ls something wrong?
- Of course something's wrong.

115
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,633
Dr Ludlow cancelled on us again.
Surprise, surprise.

116
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,793
- What excuse did he give this time?
- Something came up.

117
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,919
Something's been coming up
for the last two months.

118
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,996
Well, maybe we have to admit
he doesn't want to see us socially.

119
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,993
l guess we've been trying too hard.

120
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,993
Sam, can l get a beer, please?

121
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,711
Especially the first night when we made
such buffoons of ourselves.

122
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,758
- We, Frasier?
- All right, you.

123
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,592
- Me?
- Yes!

124
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,513
The way you fawned
over him was criminal.

125
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,069
lf you had taken off your clothes,

126
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,437
it would have been
a refreshing note of subtlety.

127
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,591
No wonder he's shunning us.

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,320
Frasier, you were so obsequious,

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,313
if he had asked you to cluck
and lay an egg,

130
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,278
you would have asked, '' What colour?''

131
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,194
Well, he didn't ask me to,
so it's a moot point at best.

132
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,952
l'm sorry.

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,352
Diane, l need tonight off.
Could you switch with me?

134
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,590
- Well...
- Why not?

135
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,117
- There's nothing going on in our lives.
- Carla, you're in luck again.

136
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,193
lt seems when you want to trade nights,
my plans get cancelled.

137
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,430
Yeah, go figure.

138
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,669
Hey, Diane.

139
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,229
You know, l've been thinking...

140
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,356
Have you?

141
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,149
The odds makers take a beating again.

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,269
Listen, is it possible this Ludlow
fellow hasn't been seeing you two

143
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,194
because he's been spending
all his time with Carla?

144
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,035
Either that or he had to
finish his paper route on Mars.

145
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,432
Sorry you felt the sting of my wit,
but it's ludicrous.

146
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,639
Now wait a minute.
There are two mysteries going on here.

147
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,395
Carla's been seeing
this very classy guy,

148
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,314
and your pal's been
avoiding you like the plague.

149
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,029
Of course, that's the lesser
of the two mysteries.

150
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,636
You're talking about one of the most
accomplished men of letters,

151
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,756
dating a common barmaid.

152
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,309
- So are you.
- She wasn't when l met her.

153
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,994
That's right. She was a lunatic.

154
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,791
No, it's true, Coach.

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,159
Many scientists believe
that the little finger, that's the pinkie,

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,598
will, like the tail, disappear
cos it serves no useful purpose.

157
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,639
People couldn't go swimming
without their little finger.

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,556
Why is that, Coach?

159
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,156
When you come out of the water,
you can't do this.

160
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,036
l stand corrected.

161
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,192
Sam, may l speak to you for a moment?

162
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
OK, a cute lunatic. All right?

163
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,388
Frasier is in a very fragile state of mind.

164
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,078
Your asinine theories, while suitable
fodder for inane bar conversation,

165
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,754
do nothing to ease his pique.

166
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,358
Wait a minute. The one word l
understood, l don't exactly care for.

167
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,114
- My theory's not asinine.
- You're right.

168
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,717
lt's a lot worse.
Think of the two of them together.

169
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,919
Bennett Ludlow and Carla?
lt's hair-brained.

170
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,071
Just imagine it!

171
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,196
Well, there it is now.

172
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,073
- No, l guess l haven't.
- Diane, what's...

173
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,872
Benny here may look like a stiff,
but he's out for a good time.

174
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,479
l was drawn to Carla from the start.

175
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,269
There's something sensual
and earthy about her.

176
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,715
Didn't any of you suspect?

177
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,190
No, you'd have to be a real brain
to figure this out,

178
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,635
don't you think, Frasier?

179
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,553
How come you kept it such a secret?

180
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,518
That's the way me
and Big Ben wanted it.

181
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,037
Our backgrounds are a little different,
which is a slight problem.

182
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,557
lf word gets around your guy
tucks his T-shirt in his undershorts,

183
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,632
your reputation is shot to hell.

184
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,712
And l had similar reasons to be discrete.

185
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,156
Yeah, well. The cat's out of the bag now.

186
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,596
Excuse me,
l have to see my customers.

187
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,354
This calls for somebody to buy a round!

188
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,911
- Well, l'll do that!
- You beat me to it. l'll get the next one.

189
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,070
Diane, excuse me.

190
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,557
Now that l'm running in egghead circles,

191
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,871
we're going to bump
into each other at parties.

192
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,192
You with your boyfriend
and me with mine... His hero.

193
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,553
OK, l think l've come to terms with this.

194
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,872
Dr Ludlow,
you came here on vacation.

195
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,998
You've had your walk on the wild side.

196
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,515
You can return
to your proper sphere,

197
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,955
refreshed and a better man.

198
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,590
Frankly, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

199
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,230
l'm going to take a short trip,
and when l come back

200
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,472
l'm going to ask
Ms Tortelli to marry me.

201
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,154
How wonderful.

202
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,198
- Sam, where is she?
- l don't know. She's never late.

203
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,316
- Did Carla call?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,473
- What did she say?
- None of your damn business.

205
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,190
How's your knuckleball?

206
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,669
Come on, we've been over this.

207
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,796
Give me a break, will you?

208
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,797
Dr Ludlow?

209
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,431
We're happy that Carla's
getting the first break of her life.

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,113
All this talk about romance
gives me a warm spot right here.

211
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,272
Or was it that meal
l had at the Hungry Heifer?

212
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,353
Yes. l went back
for their special chicken dinner.

213
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,229
- What was it?
- A bowl of pellets and a handful of grain.

214
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,358
Well, here she is.

215
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,076
What's going on?

216
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,915
Dr Ludlow has something
he wants to talk to you about.

217
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,078
l had not expected
there to be a spectators.

218
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,152
Perhaps you'd like to step over here?

219
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,234
Benny, is this what l think it is?

220
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,710
Yes, Carla. l want you to marry me.

221
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,391
- Wow, what a day!
- Well, will you?

222
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,230
- l guess l'd be crazy to say no.
- Champagne, please, for everybody!

223
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,356
All right.

224
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,596
Way to go, Doc.

225
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,512
Thank you.

226
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,796
lt happened right here.

227
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,669
Thank you. Thank you.
Champagne for everybody.

228
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,715
l couldn't help noticing
you're not exactly leaping for joy.

229
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,350
Bennett Ludlow is a wonderful catch.

230
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,229
Well...there's some things
he doesn't know about me.

231
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,278
A little mystery
is good for a marriage.

232
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,396
What haven't you told him?

233
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,235
l haven't been
completely honest about my kids.

234
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,198
What haven't you told him about them?

235
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,316
That they live.

236
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,038
He doesn't know you have children?
Carla, l think you'd better tell him.

237
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,317
He's going to wonder
who those little people are.

238
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,392
l was hoping he'd be too polite to ask.

239
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,555
l didn't want to scare him off.

240
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,508
lt's only fair that you
tell him you have five children.

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,148
- Six.
- OK, six.

242
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,880
But don't wait... l thought it was five.

243
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,157
lt was. l just came from the doctor.

244
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,509
When you were in high school
and you took Hygiene...

245
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,440
...did you cut the how-not-to lecture?

246
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,034
l had to. l was pregnant.

247
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,634
l'm the most fertile woman living.

248
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,076
There's only one foolproof
method of birth control,

249
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,196
and it makes me sick.

250
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,636
- What's that?
- Saying no.

251
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,318
- Carla, are you all right?
- l'll just go celebrate.

252
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,473
We're like a big family.
You know what they say, more to love.

253
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,995
lf you want to be in a big fa...

254
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,151
- Beat it.
- Bye.

255
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,276
My proposal was not met
with the enthusiasm l expected,

256
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,877
and it suddenly occurred to me
that l never heard the word ''yes''.

257
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,270
l know.

258
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,797
l got to tell you some things.
Would you sit down for a minute?

259
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,676
- This sounds serious.
- lt is.

260
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,792
Have you seen ''The Brady Bunch''?

261
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,069
Yes, l think so.

262
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,152
Well, picture them with knives.

263
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,356
l don't understand.

264
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,430
l have five kids.

265
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,593
- Five?
- Well, five and counting.

266
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,875
You're going to be a daddy.

267
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,190
This is quite a day.

268
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,875
You have my permission
to withdraw your proposal.

269
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,191
Do you want me
to withdraw my proposal?

270
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,318
l want you to do
what you want to do.

271
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,480
l want you to marry me.

272
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,080
You're kidding.

273
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,276
What class!

274
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,993
l still haven't heard the word ''yes''.

275
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,069
l know. Why do you think that is?

276
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,314
l think that if you look
into your feelings, you'll know.

277
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,356
Oh, yeah?

278
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,508
Yeah, l think l do.

279
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,548
- l'm in love with someone else.
- Who is it, Carla?

280
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,396
l don't know his name.
l've never even met him.

281
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,395
But l've had this picture of him in
my mind for what seems like forever.

282
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,836
But he is going to walk
into this bar one night.

283
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,197
Well, not walk, more like swagger.

284
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,511
You know, confident, but not cocky.

285
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,717
He's OK-looking, but he's no pretty-boy.

286
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,758
He's a swell dresser.

287
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,629
He's got on this burgundy leather jacket.

288
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,068
He's got cherry LifeSavers in one pocket
and a pack of Camels in the other.

289
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,949
He's trying to quit them both,
but he can't.

290
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,511
His nose is broken in all the right places.

291
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,753
And he's got this scar
that he won't talk about.

292
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,118
He cracks his knuckles all the time.
But what are you going to do?

293
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,674
Doesn't talk much. Doesn't have to.

294
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,638
He falls for me. Hard.

295
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,236
l hurt him a few times. He gets over it.

296
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,276
We get married.

297
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,835
So, you see,

298
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,596
it'd be a little messy if l was
already married when he got here.

299
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,154
You know, Carla,
l sort of have a dream girl myself.

300
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,232
Tell me about her.

301
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,918
Well, she's a spunky, hearty,
curly-haired little spitfire

302
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,470
who doesn't know
what's really good for her.

303
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,595
- l hope you find her someday.
- Me too.

304
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,395
l intend to take care
of that child financially.

305
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,597
You bet your buns you will, Benny baby.

306
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,957
- Are you OK?
- Would you knock it off?

307
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,718
OK, you're all going to know eventually
so you might as well know now.

308
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,555
l turned Benny down
and l'm pregnant again.

309
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,951
So, in case your maths is bad,
that makes six.

310
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,953
Six kids for an unmarried woman.

311
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,237
l don't want your sappy looks
or your sympathy.

312
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,994
l don't even want to talk about this.

313
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,072
l just want to be left alone. Got it?

314
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,629
Got it.

315
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,910
What are you people made of, stone?

316
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,915
English ( en)
