                 for tonight?

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:09,573
Yeah, well, sure.          
     I guess i can come up      
     with something.

4
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,111
What's the problem 
             there, wood?

5
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:15,596
Well, my theater group's    
    auditioning for             
    a spring production.

6
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:18,133
They want us each          
     to get up and perform.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,551
Any suggestions?

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,969
Why don't you do           
     a dramatic monologue?

9
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:24,739
I hear shakespeare's           
 quite good.

10
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:28,493
Or perhaps a classic   
         like rostand's         
          <i>cyrano de bergerac.</i>

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,761

        spring musical.

Hey! Very good! 
 Well done.

66
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,515
Was it the butt walk           
 that did it?

67
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,322
Well, must be. All the other   
 butt walkers got in, too.

70
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,817
What's the musical     
         you're doing?

71
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,936
We're dusting off          
     one of the old classics.

72
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:00,171
Matter of fact,            
     i got to start boning up   
     on the period.

73
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,240
Really? Now i love             
 the classic musicals.

74
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,976
W-which one you doing?         
  <i>Oklahoma? South pacific?</i>

75
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,111
No, something called,      
     uh,  <i>hair.</i>

76
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,751
Hey, dr. Crane,                
 what was it like               
 to be alive during the 1960s?

77
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:17,689
Well, i don't remember         
 much, woody.

78
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,524
I was too busy                 
 taming the west.

79
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,510
(Rebecca)  
                     woody?

80
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,046
Are you really      
            doing  <i>hair?</i>

81
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,565
Yeah.               
         How do you feel about  
         doing that nude scene?

82
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,151
[Tittering]                    
 what are you talking about,    
 miss howe?

83
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,385
The nude scene.

84
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,721
I was in a production of  <i>hair</i> 
<i> when i was in college.</i>

85
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,642
There is this very             
 famous scene where everybody   
 takes off their clothes.

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,811
Come on, miss howe,            
 it's not like i just           
 fell off the turnip truck.

87
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:44,549
That happened years ago.

88
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,768
Now, back then,                
 i might have believed          
 this nude scene business.

89
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:51,272
Actually, i guess              
 i would've believed anything   
 after being dragged 300 yards

90
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,008
down a gravel road             
 into a rose bush.

91
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,244
Jeez, woody, do you have

92
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:00,281
any fond memories of       
     childhood that             
     you can cling to?

93
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,417
The roses smelled nice.

94
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:09,607
Woody, i--i'm not kidding. 
     There is a nude scene.

95
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,576
There is. It's right           
 at the end of act 1.

96
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,078
It's a very famous number.     
 Everybody takes off            
 all their clothes.

97
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,464
Come on, miss howe,            
 if everybody gets naked,       
 in this thing,

98
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,666
how come they put me           
 in charge of the costumes?

99
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,634
Ah! Got me there, woody.

100
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,506
Hi, guys.

101
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,559
Hey, sweetheart.           
     Hey, how'd the reading     
     of eddie's will go?

102
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,011
Oh, fine.

103
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,830
It took this long              
 to read eddie's will?

104
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,548
Yeah.

105
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:36,851
Well, eddie named one  
         of his hockey buddies  
         executor of the will,

106
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,252
so the whole thing  
            took a while.

107
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,570
Why?

108
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:40,738
He forgot          
             where he put it.

109
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:44,542
Pretty tough           
         on you, huh?

110
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,943
Well, i'm comforted        
     to know

111
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:48,846
that he left            
        his other widow,        
        gloria, $100,

112
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,848
and i got the rest         
     of his estate.

113
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,917
Well, that's great.        
     What did you get?

114
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,985
Well, i got the bill    
        from his funeral,

115
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,971
i got the bill from            
 his headstone,

116
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,791
and all in all,                
 i ended up with                
 a big fat nothing.

117
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,460
It sounds like             
     the other widow made out   
     better than you did.

118
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,761
Yeah, well,                    
 yes and no.

119
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,163
She got the $100,              
 but when she wasn't looking,

120
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,298
i copped her coat.

121
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,984
What do you think?             
 Huh? Huh?

122
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:13,988
Hey.

123
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:17,391
Give me back my coat,          
 or i'm leaving                 
 with your pants.

124
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,093
All right, carla,      
         give her the coat.

125
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:27,702
Why you shaking like that?

126
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,071
You walk all the way       
     over here in the cold?

127
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,256
I had to.

128
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,957
My car keys were            
    in my coat pocket.

129
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,761
Not anymore.            
        I dropped them          
        in the nearest mailbox.

130
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,712
You'll get 'em         
         in 6 to 8 weeks.

131
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:41,900
Listen,

132
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,903
if you're still ticked off     
 about the $100,

133
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,104
you can choke on it.

134
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:47,205
It's mine.

135
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,889
Eddie gave it to me.

136
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,591
Look, i slept  
                 with the guy.

137
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,227
I made love to him.    
         I earned at least $50.

138
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:58,666
Yeah, well, i don't see you    
 giving me any of the stuff     
 he gave you.

139
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,637
I am perfectly willing to   
    give you half of everything 
    eddie left me.

140
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,104
That'd be half  
                of his debts

141
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,174
and half of his funeral 
        and headstone bills,

142
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:10,711
which should work out          
 to somewhere in                
 the neighborhood of, uh, $620.

143
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,665
Here's the $50.

144
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,667
Keep the coat.

145
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,937
Thank you.             
         It's nice doing        
         business with you.

146
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,689
Well, i know you'd             
 give me my half of             
 whatever eddie left you.

147
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,724
I would.           
             Absolutely.        
             My word of honor.

148
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:24,975
Hey, come on.

149
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,428
Let's go                       
 fish those keys                
 out of the mailbox.

150
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:29,864
You know, how do you   
         break into             
         those things?

151
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,366
Oh. Piece of cake.

152
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,601
First i gotta hold you         
 by the ankles, see...          
                 right.

153
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:40,491
Hey, miss howe,            
     i'm on page 30.            
     No one's gotten nude yet.

154
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,276
Woody, there is            
     a nude scene in  <i>hair.</i>

155
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,544
No one could miss it.

156
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,678
[Glass breaking]

157
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,247
(woody) 
                        oh, no! 
     Not even woody.

158
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,300
Oh, i'm sorry, miss howe.      
 I just broke a glass.

159
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,302
I'll clean it up        
        in a second, all right.

160
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,204
[Laughing]      
                nude scene.

161
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,841
Oh, hey, woody,                
 you dropped your script.

162
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,492
Hope i didn't lose             
 your place.

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,695
I think, you were right around 
 this nude scene.               
             Oh, thanks.

164
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,965
[Woody screaming]

165
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,591
got any michelob           
     down there, woody?

166
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,876
Checking, sam.

167
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:16,594
Wood,

168
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,213
how much longer 
                are you gonna   
                keep this up?

169
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,597
Till i get used to it.

170
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:27,171
Dr. Crane says              
    if i can get undressed      
    a little bit at a time

171
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,989
in a place where i feel     
    safe and secure,

172
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:31,075
then pretty soon,              
 i can get naked anywhere.

173
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,479
Making progress,               
 huh, wood?

174
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:37,548
Oh, you bet.

175
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,651
I mean, i'm still scared,      
 cold, and self-conscious       
 as all get-out,

176
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,253
but i did pick up          
     an extra $50 in tips.

177
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,155
Hey.

178
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,258
(Sam)              
             man.

179
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,328
What's interesting is,     
     as human beings,

180
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,097
the most evolved species       
 of the animal kingdom,

181
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,433
we should assign               
 such victorian notions         
 as guilt and shame

182
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,636
to something as beautiful      
 as the human body.

183
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,204
You know,

184
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,573
even lilith, for example,      
 still gets undressed           
 in the dark.

185
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,325
Oh, come on.

186
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,177
A woman with all of lilith's   
 psychiatric training

187
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,978
still has hang-ups         
     about nudity?

188
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,414
Actually,                      
 it was my suggestion.

189
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,091
Hi, guys.

190
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,993
How do you like         
        my hair?

191
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,511
Oh, it's just stunning. 
        What, did you get       
        a new rake?

192
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,000
For your information,      
     gloria did my hair,

193
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,267
and i did hers.

194
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:33,004
Yeah?                          
 Where's gloria now?

195
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,271
She's at the       
             beauty parlor

196
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,808
trying to get some     
         color back into hers.

197
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,642
I don't know       
             what went wrong.

198
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,813
I mean,                        
 that stuff worked great        
 on those old jeans, you know?

199
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,415
You know, carla, the last time 
 you and gloria got together,

200
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,717
the 2 of you were--were    
     at each other's throats.

201
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,270
I mean, all of a sudden,       
 you're just palling around     
 like you were mutt and jeff.

202
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:51,622
You being jeff, 
                of course.

203
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,694
We're not exactly          
     palling around.

204
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,262
She's just staying         
     at my place

205
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,664
until she goes back            
 to kenosha.

206
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,584
Carla, you got a letter here.  
 Looks kind of official.

207
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:10,140
You know what?             
     I would venture to say

208
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,010
that carla has finally         
 found a friend.

209
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,662
Sort of put me                 
 in mind of

210
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,898
the relationship               
 you seem to have               
 with cliff, norm.

211
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,432
Yeah.   
     Hey,

212
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,401
where is he tonight,           
 anyway?

213
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:22,837
I don't know.           
        He said something about 
        going to the hospital.

214
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,188
Can i get          
             another beer, sam?

215
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:29,544
All right! All right!  
         I'll, uh,

216
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:32,046
i'll give him a call,  
         or i'll stop by,

217
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:34,048
or i'll ask him about it   
     when he comes back.

218
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,818
Hey, listen to this,   
         everybody.

219
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,622
Apparently, the ice show    
    eddie skated in

220
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,008
had an                         
 accidental death policy,

221
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,811
and i'm eddie's beneficiary,

222
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,016
which is to say that           
 carla lozupone tortelli lebec

223
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:56,020
is now worth                   
 a cool $50,000.

224

 believe this!

234
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,807
Look at you.                   
 Can you imagine                
 what you can buy with $25,000?

235
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,408

listen to me.

243
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:42,166
You made an agreement there    
 to split the estate            
 with gloria.

and must never, 
                ever find out.

252
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,972
Wait a minute, now.        
     Carla, this doesn't seem   
     exactly right.

253
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,992
Ok, then try this:

254
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,928

 a lot of money.

267
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,600
You sure you don't want        
 to split that                  
 with your best pal?

268
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,368
Oh, you mean gloria?

269
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:53,537
Look, it's her own fault.  
     If she'd been here         
     2 minutes ago,

270
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,439
she'd have got 
                 a free beer.

271
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,524
We were all witnesses      
     when you gave              
     your word of honor

272
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,760
that you'd split anything      
 he left you 50-50.

273
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:01,095
My word of honor,

274
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:04,098
if you don't shut up,          
 i'll split you 50-50.

275
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,983
Now, carla,    
                 you're getting 
                 defensive.

276
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,952
I have a feeling   
             that maybe         
             deep down inside,

277
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,004
you're beginning to feel   
     a little bit guilty.

278
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,873
Hey, look, if i feel guilty,   
 it's my business.

279
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,642
(Frasier)      
                 all right,     
                 suit yourself.

280
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,177
It's the worst thing   
         a person can do,       
         keep guilt inside.

281
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,947
It has an insidious way 
        of bringing itself      
        to the surface.

282
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,582
Sure. What do you think's   
    gonna happen?

283
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,685
Suddenly, i'm gonna come down  
 with a severe case             
 of the shakes?

284
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,871
Yes,               
             exactly my point.

285
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:29,423
Well, i did it             
     on purpose, you quack.

286
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,244
Ok, guys,

287
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,079
here i go.

288
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:37,114
Off to my dress rehearsal.

289
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,982
[Chuckles]

290
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,552
dress rehearsal.       
         What bitter irony.

291
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,407
Now, listen, woody.

292
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,910
When you take off              
 your clothes on that stage,    
 it's not exhibitionism.

293
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:53,530
You are becoming a part        
 of the rich heritage           
 of the theater.

294
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,900
You're joining a continuum     
 that stretches back

295
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:58,668
from shakespeare               
 to the greeks,                 
 to the romans,

296
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:02,306
and all the way back           
 into the endless mists         
 of time.

297
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,026
Gee, i never           
         thought about it       
         that way, dr. Crane.

298
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:06,193
Really?

299
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,211
I had.

300
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,999
Well, maybe i am making 
        too much of this.

301
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:15,603
You know, it's not like     
    they're forcing us          
    to take our clothes off.

302
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,572
In fact, the director said     
 that we only have to           
 take our clothes off

303
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,508
if the spirit moves us.

304
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,209
So what's      
                 your problem?

305
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:26,313
You know, we are,  
             after all,         
             born naked, woody.

306
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,816
I mean, it's man's  
            natural state.

307
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:32,052
I mean, you and i       
        are both naked          
        underneath our clothes.

308
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,621
Dr. Crane,                     
 you're a married man.

309
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,662
Perhaps i'd do better      
     to have a little chat      
     with this gentleman here.

310
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,202
Hey, norm,

311
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,137
did you ever find out      
     what happened to cliffie?

312
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:51,855
Uh, yeah, yeah.                
 It turns out it was            
 the hospital.

313
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,924
He, uh, had a little           
 minor surgery.

314
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,259
No big deal. He'll be...       
                         hmm.

315
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,794
Yeah, he'll be back         
    in a couple days.

316
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:57,995
How's he feeling?

317
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,329
I'll tell you what, uh,

318
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,465
he's on the phone there.    
    Why don't you               
    ask him yourself?

319
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:14,661
Cliffie? Is that you?

320
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:16,696
Heh!

321
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:19,533
[Stammering]

322
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,702
oh, yeah, yeah. I bet--    
     i bet it does hurt to have 
     those things cauterized.

323
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,821
Yeah.

324
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,341
Uh-huh.

325
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:29,810
Uh-huh.

326
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:32,747
Uh-huh.

327
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,235
Hi, carla.

328
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:41,188
Look, i got my hair back       
 to its original shade.

329
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,823
Great.          
         Yeah.

330
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,042
They had stuff left over,      
 so they did my purse           
 to match.

331
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,496
And i got one done         
     for you, too.

332
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:50,564
Here. Catch.

333
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,267
See you back                   
 at your house.

334
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:01,542
Well, that was             
     nice of gloria.

335
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,545
Now every time                 
 you open your purse,           
 you can think about her.

336
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:09,000
Why don't you              
     just leave me alone?       
     I got work to do, ok?

337
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,235
[Ice rattling]

338
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:17,958
[ice rattling]

339
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,876
sam, did we send   
             something to woody 
             for opening night?

340
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:38,078
Uh, yeah.                      
 As a matter of fact,           
 we did--

341
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,898
we were going to send him      
 flowers and candy,             
 but that's so impersonal.

342
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,066
We sent him                    
 a very nice wristwatch.

343
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,452
A watch?

344
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,020
17 jewels, leather band.

345
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,054
Whoa!           
 Yeah.

346
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:49,590
How much did that cost?

347
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:52,542
Uh, actually nothing.       
    We got it out of            
    the lost and found.

348
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,480
It had been in there        
    30 days, ok?

349
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,065
It was under                   
 a lot of stuff, but...

350
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,021
uh, can we get             
     a couple of beers, miss?   
 Yeah. Couple of beers, sam.

351
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,590
Coming up, here,               
 sweetheart.

352
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,509
How you feeling, huh?

353
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,511
Fine. Fine. No problem.    
 Yeah?

354
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,080
Everything is           
        perfectly ok with me.

355
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,581
Good.

356
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:15,649
There you go.

357
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,223
That'll be $3.

358
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,099
Come here.

359
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,319
This has been                  
 going on                       
 for a week,

360
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:37,120
and it's not getting           
 any better.

361
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:39,874
Now i think we all know        
 why you're shaking like this.

362
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:43,544
I mean, admit it.              
 You're walking around          
 carrying a very big load.

363
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:46,130
You bet,               
         and i got it strapped  
         around me in cash.

364
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,365
No. I meant guilt.

365
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,635
Really?

366
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,287
[Chuckling]             
        can i see it?

367
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,626
Well, my friends,

368
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:01,294
you have missed            
     a once-in-a-lifetime

369
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,030
landmark evening

370
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:04,632
in the history             
     of community theater.

371
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,818
Did woody chicken out?

372
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:08,852
Oh, no, indeed.

373
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,459
Why didn't you stop me,        
 mr. Peterson?

374
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,644
Why didn't anybody          
    stop me?

375
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,179
Woody, what happened?

376
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:21,231
All last week during rehearsal 
 i kept thinking,

377
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,835
"why am i                  
     the only one who's         
     afraid to get naked?

378
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:27,204
Why am i the only one          
 who's ashamed?"

379
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,473
So tonight, when i got out     
 in front of that audience,

380
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,508
i ripped off every             
 stitch of clothing.

381
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,777
I looked around                
 and i thought,

382
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,312
"why am i the only one         
 who's naked?"

383
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,605
Well, m-maybe nobody           
 noticed, wood.

384
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:47,173
Oh, they           
             noticed, sam.

385
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,461
As if that wasn't              
 bad enough,

386
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,896
i heard this high-pitched      
 scream from the audience.

387
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:55,032
"Hey, look. He's the only      
 one who's naked!"

388
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,184
Sorry, wood.               
     You took me by surprise.

389
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,361
Well, at least the evening     
 wasn't a total disaster.

390
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:10,881
I was really touched           
 by this nice watch             
 you guys gave me.

391
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,366
I needed one, too.             
 I lost one just like it        
 about a month ago.

392
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,512
Can i have a beer?             
     Yeah. Beer, sam.

393
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,665
Look at this, sam.     
         I don't need the use   
         of my hands.

394
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:32,035
I rigged my tray               
 so i can do my job perfectly.

395
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,368
That's my beer?

396
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:48,935
Yeah. Take it yourself

397
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,270
and don't forget my tip.

398
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,975
If you're gonna                
 put it in there that far,

399
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,443
there better be                
 a ring with it.

400
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,951
Well, i'm          
             perfectly ok, sam.

401
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,153
I think            
             i'm gonna make it.

402
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:10,290
I just have to      
            hang in there       
            for another 3 days,

403
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:13,127
and gloria          
            will be on that bus 
            back to kenosha,

404
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:15,178
and all my problems 
            will be solved.     
 No, wait a minute.

405
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:18,032
Are you saying                 
 that it's her fault            
 that you're shaking?

406
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:21,384
Of course she is.      
         It's all part of her   
         fiendish plan.

407
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,923
Why would she have             
 a fiendish plan?

408
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,758
Because she knows  
             all about the      
             insurance money.

409
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,294
How do you know                
 she knows?

410
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:33,046
Because she acts               
 like she doesn't know.         
 That's how i know she knows.

411
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,216
Do you wanna hear  
             an example

412
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,820
of what this cruel woman is 
    trying to do                
    to break my spirit?

413
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:41,989
She's being nice!

414
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,309
Y-you know what        
         she did last night?

415
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,378
She did 8 loads    
             of laundry,

416
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,480
and i don't have       
         a washer and dryer.

417
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:53,717
Carla!

418
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,754
Carla, what are you        
     doing here?

419
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,524
(Gloria)                       
 i told you                     
 to stay home today.

420
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,994
I've been worried sick         
 about the way                  
 you've been shaking.

421
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:08,332
Now, i want you        
         to go home right now   
         and get some rest.

422
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,802
I left a pot       
             of minestrone      
             on the stove.

423
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,803
Are you from hell?

424
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,591
And i don't want you   
         to worry about missing 
         your pay here

425
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,976
because i'm gonna      
         finish your shift.

426
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,695
You are from hell. She is.     
 She's from hell, sam.

427
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:23,747
You are from hell!

428
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,349
Calm down--

429
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,284
no! No! No! No!        
         Don't touch me!        
         Don't touch me!

430
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,319
You know           
             about the money!   
             Admit it!

431
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,654
You know!          
             I know you know!

432
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,572
Oh, why are you         
        torturing me like this?

433
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,242
All right. All right.   
        Here it is. Here it is.

434
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,311
Here's half         
            of the $50,000

435
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,813
from eddie's       
             insurance money.

436
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,481
Here. Take it!

437
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,085
Eddie had insurance money?

438
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,388
I didn't know that.

439
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:49,373
Give me that!

440
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:55,979
Oh, my god.

441
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,798
Oh, the hell       
             with it. Here.

442
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:58,865
Take it.

443
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,439
Great.

444
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:07,474
I'm not shaking anymore.

445
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,343
I can go back          
         to hustling drinks.

446
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,278
Oh, joy.

447
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:16,833
So that's why      
             you were shaking?

448
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,635
Because your conscience 
        was bothering you,

449
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,904
and now,            
            out of the goodness 
            of you heart,

450
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,206
you're giving me   
             all this money

451
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:25,058
even though it's   
             rightfully yours?

452
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,026
That's right, gloria.

453
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,328
What a chump.

454
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,282
What?

455
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,634
Just because of        
         a little shaking?

456
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:36,720
Huh!

457
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,738
No wonder eddie        
         wanted another wife.

458
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:51,668
I don't care   
                 what she says.

459
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:54,054
I know in my heart

460
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,922
that i did          
            the right thing.

461
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,478
Besides,               
         i still got $25,000.   
     Yeah.

462
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,364
I mean, that can buy       
     a lot of things, you know?

463
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:07,083
Yeah, you bet. You know,       
 i'm proud of you, too.

464
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,069
So, what are you           
     gonna buy first?

465
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,290
A big, expensive car,

466
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:15,425
so the next time i see her,

467
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,561
i can run the slut down.

468
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:24,755
