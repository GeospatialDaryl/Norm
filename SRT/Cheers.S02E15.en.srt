1
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:07,349
AND COACHIE MAKES THREE

2
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:22,114
CIiffie, don't Iook now, but there are two
chicks at the end of the bar staring at us.

3
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,116
You're crazy.

4
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:27,703
They been staring for 20 minutes.
Do we Iook weird?

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,913
- You do.
- Why?

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,001
Cos you're taIking
out of the side of your mouth.

7
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:40,007
They can't take their eyes off us.

8
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:47,723
There's onIy one way to be sure.
ToodIe down the end of the bar

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,434
and see if their eyes foIIow us.

10
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:56,023
So are they Iooking?

11
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:04,323
I'd say those suppIe young petunias
definiteIy want us.

12
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:10,954
- So what do we do now?
- Just take a waIk over there.

13
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,165
I wiII if you wiII.

14
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:20,798
On second thoughts,
why don't we pIay it cooI?

15
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:26,345
- We Iet them come to us.
- Those babes are reaIIy hot for us.

16
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:32,142
- That's it, foIks. CIosing time.
- Here they come, moving in for the kiII.

17
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:38,649
Excuse me.

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:43,946
My friend and I were wondering
if you knew a Iate-night spot to go to.

19
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:46,573
Some pIace a IittIe fun.

20
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,425
What was that?

21
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,475
These guys are Martians.

22
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:16,937
- Come on. They're nerds.
- Their Ioss.

23
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:45,358
WeII, they've gone now.
You can turn off the charm.

24
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,696
You were a reaI smoothy yourseIf.

25
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,575
Listen to Cary Grant.
That was humiIiating.

26
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:56,745
What difference does it make?

27
00:03:56,912 --> 00:04:00,373
They weren't that good-Iooking anyway.

28
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,629
AbsoIuteIy. We aImost took the
midnight train to Bow-Wow City.

29
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:09,800
You're right.
I've seen better Iegs on a pooI tabIe.

30
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:13,220
You couId use that chest
for a straightedge.

31
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:18,475
- Put a bag over your head.
- Or a gunny sack. It'II cover more.

32
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:40,789
Great eats, Diane. Thanks.

33
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:44,209
Did you enjoy your <i>rognons</i>
<i>de veau aux chanterelles?</i>

34
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,257
Was that the green stuff?

35
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,886
No. That was the brown stuff.

36
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:58,849
Good. That green stuff
kind of repeats on you.

37
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:04,145
- I'm dreadfuIIy sorry.
- Quite aII right.

38
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,362
WeII, I am gonna check some scores out
on the tube here, I think.

39
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:18,660
You know, I went to a Iot of troubIe
with this meaI.

40
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:20,620
So did I.

41
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:26,084
I'm joking. It was wonderfuI.
Thank you very much.

42
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:29,379
It's a pIeasure to cook for a gourmand.

43
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:38,471
- Sam, what's happening to us?
- Are you repeating too?

44
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,646
A IittIe,
but that's not what I'm taIking about.

45
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,524
We're becoming humdrum. Routine.

46
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:54,571
I teII you what. After my meaI
settIes here, I'II attack you.

47
00:05:56,114 --> 00:06:00,035
WeII, you may be in the mood
earIier than you think.

48
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:05,957
Make yourseIf comfortabIe. I'II take care
of something in the other room.

49
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,255
- Who's there?
- Me. Who's there?

50
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,927
- Coach?
- No, I'm Coach.

51
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:26,811
- What are you doing here, Coach?
- At Ieast we got that straight.

52
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:31,733
We aImost had the most incredibIe
disaster. Look at this TV guide.

53
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,653
''Thunder Road''.

54
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,826
Mitchum. We haven't missed a Mitchum
movie together in over 1 2 years.

55
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:47,082
- We don't wanna miss the beginning.
- Mitchum won't start without us.

56
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,920
- We're gonna need munchies.
- Diane's got some.

57
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:58,468
WhiIe you're up, turn down the Iights.
There's a terribIe gIare on the screen.

58
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,570
Take me, you barbarian.

59
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,285
You're gonna miss ''Thunder Road''.

60
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,293
- What happened?
- Nothing yet. They're going up the road.

61
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,005
No, with Diane.
Hey, Diane, you aII right?

62
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,178
What is Coach doing here?

63
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:48,101
He's watching ''Thunder Road''. We
aIways watch Mitchum movies together.

64
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,855
It's a bad time right now.

65
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:56,568
I know, but it's a tradition
that goes back with us for years.

66
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:00,780
He's our favourite actor.
Never do we miss his movies.

67
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:06,202
I came out of the bedroom and I was so
embarrassed with how I was dressed.

68
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,956
Come in here. I'II show you what I mean.
Come on.

69
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,126
Coach, scram. Out.

70
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,336
What?

71
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,550
- What's wrong?
- Sam.

72
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,388
- A IittIe tact.
- I'm sorry. Coach, Iisten.

73
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,599
What?

74
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:31,644
Diane and I had this speciaI evening
going here.

75
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:36,941
She just fixed me a meaI
with aII my favourite coIours.

76
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:39,694
Changed into something friIIy.

77
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:43,573
And I come barging in.
I wasn't even thinking.

78
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,702
Diane, forgive me. I never
wanted to get in your way.

79
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,996
Thank you for understanding.

80
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:54,876
When you Iive aIone,
you forget other peopIe have Iives.

81
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:06,929
- Are you feeIing what I'm feeIing?
- Yeah. Poor Coach.

82
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:11,309
We have so many hours together,

83
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:16,105
I guess it's kind of seIfish
not to spend a IittIe time with him.

84
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:21,277
- You're right. I'II get him.
- Bet you can catch him on the steps.

85
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,950
- Why are you standing there?
- My coat got caught in the door.

86
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:33,581
I didn't have the heart
to bother you again. Good night.

87
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,877
No, Coach, come here. Listen.

88
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,756
You are gonna watch ''Thunder Road''
with us. Sit down.

89
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,967
- You mean it?
- You bet. Come on over.

90
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,221
I've never seen it.
TeII me what's happened.

91
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:53,351
I know every Iine in this picture.
Here's my favourite part.

92
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:04,654
When I'm in charge of the bar,
I know what God feeIs Iike.

93
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:09,242
- How's that?
- I'm in controI of peopIe's destinies.

94
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,412
I can make their drinks too strong
so they get sick.

95
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:18,417
Or I can water them down
so they pay for nothing.

96
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,046
Or if I don't Iike their attitudes,
I can spit in it.

97
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:34,517
You're not stiII upset about that argument
we had the other day?

98
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,727
You teII me.

99
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:54,704
I'm sorry about this morning
when I caIIed you a sawed-off witch.

100
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:13,264
I'm Sam MaIone. Maybe you remember
me before we became a threesome.

101
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,474
Yes, I recognise you now.

102
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:19,145
- You shaved off your Pantusso.
- That's it.

103
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:25,443
- I know.
- I can't take it any more.

104
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,407
- We never go anypIace without Coach.
- I don't invite him. He just shows up.

105
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:36,287
- What are we gonna do?
- Right now, we're gonna sit in my office.

106
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:41,083
We're gonna Iook into
each other's eyes, aII aIone.

107
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,294
That sounds so wonderfuI.

108
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:45,713
Where have you been?

109
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,344
Coach, I'm sorry. I oversIept.
We were up Iate Iast night watching...

110
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,891
- ''Mothra Versus GodziIIa''.
- Was I disappointed in that.

111
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:05,524
We've got to draw the Iine. No way
can we spend the evening with Coach.

112
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,319
You're absoIuteIy right.

113
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:11,781
Are we gonna get together tonight?

114
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:15,826
- You bet.
- Great.

115
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,333
AII right. There's onIy one soIution
to this probIem.

116
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,129
We have to teII the Coach
to stop hanging around with us.

117
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:34,095
Diane's right. TeII Coach you don't want
him around. That's the honest approach.

118
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:39,433
Or to make it easier on Coach, rip out
his heart and do a tap-dance on it.

119
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,521
- I got it here.
- What?

120
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:46,690
Make him think you got a bad disease.

121
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:51,862
Get reaI skinny, and you paint
your faces white and pasty.

122
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,449
WaIk around Iooking Iike
you're gonna throw up.

123
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:59,703
You'd better hurry up.
Diane's got a head start.

124
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:13,175
Coach Iikes you guys. Take him
off our hands for tonight, pIease.

125
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:18,139
We don't want Coach getting in
the way when we're hustIing chicks.

126
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:20,391
Sorry I asked.

127
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:27,731
It's against my beIiefs to heIp things go
smoothIy with the squawk box there,

128
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:31,652
but since Coach is invoIved,
I'm gonna bend the ruIes.

129
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,364
I know he has a crush
on a teIIer at his bank.

130
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,952
- Are you sure?
- He taIks about her a Iot.

131
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:44,290
I don't know her name,
but she couId take him off your hands.

132
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,169
That's good. What do you say?
It's worth a try.

133
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:52,131
I think Coach wouId be
embarrassed by a bIind date.

134
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:57,553
We'II pretend she's my friend
and it'II Iook Iike a chance meeting.

135
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,432
Coach,
maybe you can heIp me out here.

136
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:07,855
- I want a new bank. You Iike yours?
- I Iove it. Bay Harbor Savings and Loan.

137
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:11,400
- Do you Iike the teIIers?
- They're terrific.

138
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:16,197
Is there one I shouId taIk to?
FriendIy, nice, cute?

139
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:18,407
Frank.

140
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,577
Who's the one you aIways taIk to?

141
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:24,830
Redhead with a nice smiIe
who aIways winks?

142
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,041
- Yeah.
- That's Frank.

143
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:33,130
Isn't there a woman
that you Iike at the bank there?

144
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,967
Edwina.

145
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:40,220
Edwina at Bay Harbor
Savings and Loan?

146
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:44,475
- She's a friend of mine.
- Then you shouId know Frank.

147
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,560
They're married.

148
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:52,733
No. Who's the one you said
was a nice Iady Iast Thursday?

149
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,737
- Thursday. SteIIa.
- SteIIa. That's my friend.

150
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:00,616
No, not SteIIa.
I'm not too crazy about SteIIa.

151
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:04,119
- I meant Dorothy.
- Yes, so did I.

152
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:09,333
- Dorothy is the one you Iike, right?
- She's very nice.

153
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,918
Excuse me.

154
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,632
But not as nice as JuIia.

155
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:24,056
That's the grocery store.
At the bank, nobody beats Sandra.

156
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,266
Sandra. That's my friend.

157
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,899
- What is it?
- Not Sandra, it's Anita.

158
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,110
I'II take this.

159
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:45,619
- Wrong girI, Coach?
- No. Wrong bank.

160
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:05,148
WeII, Katherine,
didn't you Iove that meaI?

161
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,650
It was very nice.

162
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,236
I'm gIad we had Coach aIong.

163
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:14,657
An ItaIian knows what to order
in an ItaIian restaurant.

164
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:17,869
It was wonderfuI.
What was that dish caIIed?

165
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:23,499
Spaghetti for four. They've got a better
one, though, spaghetti for six,

166
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,710
but you need more peopIe.

167
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:31,007
I'II make coffee.
Make yourseIves at home.

168
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,217
There you go.

169
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,688
You know something? I can't get over
the fact Diane knew Katherine,

170
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:49,108
my favourite teIIer at First FideIity.

171
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,695
WeII, it's a smaII worId, I guess, Coach.

172
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:57,325
And she seems to know everybody
in every bank I've deaIt with.

173
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,702
You know how friendIy she is.

174
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:04,248
How did you and Katherine
come to meet?

175
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,584
- The Ioan desk.
- The drop...

176
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:12,882
That's aII right, honey. Sometimes
I forget things too. Or do I?

177
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,761
Coach, you tickIe me.
Are you aIways this funny?

178
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:18,971
I doubt it.

179
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:30,274
So, Katherine, what's new and exciting
in the worId of high finance?

180
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:34,070
Nothing that I know of.
My most exciting moment

181
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:38,699
is catching someone pIaying
with their Iips on cIosed circuit TV.

182
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:41,077
I knew you Iooked famiIiar.

183
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:46,040
Hang on a moment.

184
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:51,295
WeII, I think banking is fascinating.

185
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:56,175
There are so many facets.
So many things I've wondered about.

186
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,970
- Me too, you know?
- Like what?

187
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:03,933
TeIIers never teII you anything.
They aIways ask questions.

188
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,688
There's nothing interesting
about interest. It's boring.

189
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:14,193
The trust department have pens chained
to tabIes. What kind of trust is that?

190
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,241
- There he goes again. You're too much.
- A IittIe giddy, but nice.

191
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:26,289
Look at the time. I've got to get up
at the crack of dawn.

192
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:30,835
What a wonderfuI evening.
I'II take a rain check on coffee.

193
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:35,214
It is getting kinda Iate.
Can I see you get home OK?

194
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:39,844
Thanks. I'd Iike that.
Good night, Diane. Thank you.

195
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:42,972
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night.

196
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:46,851
- Good night. We'II do it again.
- AbsoIuteIy.

197
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:56,027
This shows that sticky situations are
best handIed with Iies and trickery.

198
00:18:57,194 --> 00:19:00,573
And now for a IittIe romance.

199
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,287
A IittIe hug.

200
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:10,166
A IittIe kiss.

201
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,295
- A IittIe Coach.
- Excuse me.

202
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,591
I thought you were
gonna show Katherine home.

203
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,552
I showed her where the bus stop is.

204
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:27,391
You probabIy didn't notice,
but she had the hots for me.

205
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:29,477
What's wrong with that?

206
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:35,941
She's nice, but she doesn't fit in with us.
Like a fourth wheeI. I need cookies.

207
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:46,243
- What do we do now?
- It's time to teII the truth.

208
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,497
- Good.
- I'II handIe this.

209
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:53,376
- Coach, get out here.
- Want one?

210
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,003
No. Listen.

211
00:19:58,172 --> 00:20:03,677
I'm gonna teII you something, and
I don't care if it hurts your feeIings.

212
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:06,013
What is it?

213
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,184
Diane doesn't want you
hanging around us any more.

214
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:17,108
What? That's not true. Sam doesn't want
you around. I Iove having you around.

215
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:22,279
I Iove having him around more than you.
I'd rather have him around than you.

216
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:26,033
- WeII, fine.
- Don't sneak around me Iike this.

217
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,788
AII right. PIease stop.
Kids, hoId on, pIease.

218
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,916
I'm beginning to see the Iight here.

219
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:38,337
- You don't have the guts to teII me.
- I do, Diane doesn't.

220
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,548
What is it? Say it.

221
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,801
Come on. Say it.

222
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:50,391
When you were a drunk and nobody
toId you, I toId you, didn't I?

223
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:53,978
- Over and over again.
- You reaIIy were a drunk.

224
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:56,188
I know.

225
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,234
- I mean, you were reaIIy a drunk.
- Don't start again.

226
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:06,365
Is our friendship so weak that we can't
come out teII each other the truth?

227
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:11,996
You're right.

228
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:16,083
We just don't want you
hanging around us so much.

229
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:24,884
If you don't want me, it's fine.
I'm not mad.

230
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,847
It's fine. I'II see you.

231
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,685
But you reaIIy were a drunk.

232
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:54,121
- Morning, Norm.
- Where the heck have you been?

233
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:58,834
- Is my watch fast?
- Sorry. We had a difficuIt evening.

234
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:03,380
We had to teII Coach
we didn't want to see him any more.

235
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:06,425
It was terribIe. Worse than we feared.

236
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,304
We spent haIf the night arguing
about who was to bIame.

237
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,983
- Morning, everybody.
- How are you today, Norman?

238
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,194
As if you cared.

239
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:29,114
Coach didn't take weII
to getting the oId heave-ho.

240
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,950
He was destroyed. He tried to cover,

241
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:36,914
but there was no masking the pain
Sam infIicted on his deepest being.

242
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:40,459
Don't start again.
You did most of the taIking.

243
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:49,093
What difference does it make who did it?
The point is Coach has been crushed.

244
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:51,303
We have to Iive with that.

245
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,264
EspeciaIIy you.

246
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:58,685
- It was your idea. You insisted.
- That's the most...

247
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:02,606
Listen. I wanna know
which one of you two kids

248
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:06,026
got the idea to throw me out Iast night.

249
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:09,405
Come on. I wanna know right now.

250
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:14,326
Come on. What difference does it make
whose fauIt it was?

251
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,621
It's done.
We both have to share the bIame.

252
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:25,337
Yes, the important thing is
that we showed you our feeIings.

253
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:32,052
- Honesty was our onIy recourse.
- AbsoIuteIy. It was a mutuaI decision.

254
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:39,309
Whoever it was, I wanna thank
them from the bottom of my heart.

255
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:43,230
Because I caught up with Katherine
at the bus stop

256
00:23:43,397 --> 00:23:49,069
and I took her home, got to know her
and she's the most wonderfuI woman.

257
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:51,989
I haven't been this happy in years.

258
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:55,993
That's wonderfuI.
You don't know how happy we are.

259
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,957
And the fact that we had anything to do
with it makes this feeI even better.

260
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:08,005
AbsoIuteIy. Just think of it as the two of
us being abIe to do something for you.

261
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:14,970
Say, Normie,
aren't they a wonderfuI coupIe?

262
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:53,717
