1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,795
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,196
I am in a wonderful mood today.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,313
I spent the weekend
at an lndian film festival.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,112
It left me euphoric.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,391
I love lndian films.
Remember <i>Fort Apache?</i>

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,035
Just thinking about it makes the hair
on my arms go up. Look!

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,994
No, Coach, we're not
talking about American Indians.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,989
I can make the hair on my arms
stand up any time I want. See?

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,670
Carla!

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,349
Think that's something?
Cathy Settudicato, from St Clete's,

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,790
belched the whole 23rd Psalm
at the talent show once.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,593
That's good, but I knew this guy,
Randy Evans, first baseman,

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,917
he could make his eyeballs vibrate.
I always wanted to.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,909
- Randy Evans? Who'd he play for?
- Mostly the Cleveland lndians.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,192
Speaking of Indians, remember
<i>Fort Apache?</i> Just thinking of it...

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,638
Go, bumps!

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,550
- Hi, Sam.
- How are you, Marshall?

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,194
- How's everything at school?
- Fine.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,116
- Could I have a beer, please?
- Of course, Marshall.

20
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,391
Marshall, good to see you, sexy.

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,800
- Hi, Carla.
- So, how you doing?

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,310
My uric acid is up
to seven-point-five.

23
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,000
That explains
that twinkle in your eye.

24
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,191
Diane, this is Marshall.
Marshall, Diane.

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,118
- Hi, Marshall.
- You'll love this kid, Diane.

26
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,151
Very smart. Teaches at a college.

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,036
- MlT.
- See? He can spell good, too.

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,150
Marshall teaches a subject
I know nothing about.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,714
Could you narrow that down a bit?

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,716
- I'm in cybernetics.
- Right!

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,958
The more we learn about cybers,
the better we can control 'em.

32
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,551
Why did you get into computers?

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,310
I enjoy integrating formerly
unassociated supporting elements

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,590
to maximise a probability ratio

35
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,915
by interweaving the input data.

36
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,600
Watch it, Marshall, I'm heatin' up!

37
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,198
Marshall can make his computer
do incredible things.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,154
Write poetry, play games, make
predictions on elections, sports.

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,396
Sounds like fun.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,789
You got any hot tips for us,
Marshall?

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,150
The Celtics will lose today.

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,714
Watch your tongue, Marshall.

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,593
No, let me show you.
Take a look at this.

44
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,195
Can't argue with that, Sam.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,792
You see, this shows correlation
between the Celtics' win-loss record

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,199
and the relative activity
of the Van Allen radiation belt.

47
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,995
Isn't that the one
that Buster Crabbe wears on TV?

48
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,917
I know it sounds a little crazy,

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,996
but just by coincidence,

50
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,114
I noticed that the days
the belt is in a state of flux,

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,435
the Celtics are always beaten.

52
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,394
Are you sure? Your computer
wouldn't be pulling your leg?

53
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,918
No, my computer never kids, Sam.

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,477
He appreciates a good joke,
but he never tells one.

55
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,554
- Mind if I borrow this for a while?
- Sure.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,114
- Thanks.
- I have to go now.

57
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,396
- So long.
- Bye. See you, Carla.

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,190
Don't break too many hearts,
Marshall.

59
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,990
I get around you, and my testosterone
goes up 78 percent.

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,876
Do you really find me attractive?

61
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,790
I love a stylish guy.

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,795
You've got the new wet look.

63
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,795
Your hair, your palms...

64
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,799
Coach?

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,592
When was the last time
you had a sure thing?

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,599
- Rosie McGonagle.
- No, Coach.

67
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,076
I'm talking about
betting against the Celtics.

68
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,918
Sam, you can't do that!

69
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,996
Come on, Marshall's never wrong.

70
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,591
We've never bet against
a Boston team. We've never done that.

71
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,392
I know.

72
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,669
Think hard about this.
All our customers'll turn against us.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,631
I know, they'd never forgive us.

74
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,399
They'd hate us
for the rest of our lives.

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,992
Of course, we're not gonna
live forever, are we?

76
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,592
I'll get it down.

77
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,838
We can't let any of the boys know
about this. It's gotta be quiet.

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,713
I can't even remember
what we were talking about.

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,992
Sam, we were talking about
betting against the Celtics!

80
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,390
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

81
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,397
I worry about him.

82
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

83
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,993
- Norman.
- What's doing, Norm?

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,192
Well, science is seeking
a cure for thirst.

85
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,197
I happen to be the guinea pig.

86
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,913
- Oh, boy.
- Rough day?

87
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,316
Yeah. Vera read a woman's magazine
over the weekend

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,954
about putting romance
back in your marriage.

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,433
You're in trouble.

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,199
She says I gotta act
like we're courting.

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,916
I got to call her up for a date, buy
flowers, take her someplace fancy.

92
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,395
- Sounds good.
- I'm a romantic guy.

93
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,592
I go to the corner,
use the payphone, call her up,

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,837
she turns me down. Who needs it?

95
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,909
Game time, Sammy.

96
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,350
Turn on the set, pour me a beer
and let's start dribbling.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,589
How you doin', Coach?

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,191
Cheers. Diane's busy at the moment.
Can I say who's calling?

99
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,995
Her mother?
A pleasure to meet you, Mrs Chambers.

100
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,190
I'm Sam Malone.

101
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,990
Yeah? She mentioned me?

102
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,791
No, I'm not scratching myself
at the moment.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,878
Yeah, hold on a second,
I'll get her for you.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,588
Diane, it's your mother.

105
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,000
Take it from me, you're not adopted.

106
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,990
Thank you. Mommy?

107
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,598
What?

108
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,595
Oh, no!

109
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,232
No.

110
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,759
I'll be alright.

111
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,397
I'll call you back later, OK?

112
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,396
- Elizabeth is dead.
- Gee, Diane, that's awful.

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,996
A member of your family?

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,152
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
She was our family cat.

115
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,478
Cat? You scared us, Diane.

116
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,319
You should've said that
right off the bat.

117
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,998
Diane, did you spend
a lot of time with the cat?

118
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,795
Well, since I left home,
I've only seen her in the holidays.

119
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,439
Too bad.

120
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,195
Alright, we got tip-off time here.

121
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,432
Not bad.

122
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,470
What a bad bat!

123
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,072
Diane, could I have another beer?

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,478
Diane, you working or what?

125
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,393
I am sorry to interrupt, but I have
something important to say.

126
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,914
Since I have been here,

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,998
I have struggled
to make certain changes in myself

128
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,270
in order
to fit in to the general milieu.

129
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,756
- And you're doing a good job...
- It has not been easy.

130
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,113
However, I am proud to say
that, for example,

131
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,789
I no longer have to cover my eyes
when I watch a hockey fight.

132
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,598
In one case, I even took sides.

133
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,196
But now, in my moment of crisis,

134
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,993
it is glaringly apparent
that no one here

135
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,398
has made any effort
to understand my sensibilities.

136
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,390
No, this is me.

137
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,189
Diane?

138
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,397
Something my father used to say
when we had a death in the family.

139
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,393
Maybe it'll help. He'd say,

140
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,792
"Sprinkle the ashes,

141
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,593
all the tangible remains
of our dear one."

142
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,193
"But thank God for the intangibles."

143
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,600
"The impact of his life on ours."

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,191
"We remember the smile,

145
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,037
the frown, the quizzical look,

146
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,592
the love, the courage..."

147
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,153
Commercials are over.

148
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,319
Fun times, hurt, moments
of searching, risk, affirmation,

149
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,989
and a whole bunch of other stuff.
Come on, Celtics, go!

150
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,516
- Did the Celtics start without me?
- Yeah. Losing without him, too.

151
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,200
- How we doin'?
- Down nine, a minute and change.

152
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,959
- We can still win, right, Coachie?
- Sure, Norm.

153
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,594
I wish I had some money
on the Celtics.

154
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,598
Don't you wish you had money
on the Celtics, Sam?

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,069
- Go wait on somebody.
- Good idea. I'll wait on somebody.

156
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,153
Miss? I'm all by myself.
I only ordered one beer.

157
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,590
Didn't I see you with other people?

158
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,269
I was here last night with people,
but they're not with me tonight.

159
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,914
I see. They're all gone.

160
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,034
Everything in life comes and goes.
The things that matter most to us

161
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,913
are taken away
when we can't afford to lose them.

162
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,749
In the end, everything we strive for
comes to nothing.

163
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,193
- I'll take away the extra beers.
- No.

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,788
Suddenly, I'm in the mood
for all of 'em.

165
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,835
Vampira, get to work, here.

166
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,955
Carla, could we talk for a minute?
I really need to talk to somebody.

167
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,716
Carla, please? Have you ever lost
a pet? Have you ever had a pet?

168
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,797
Are you kidding? I've been through it
a thousand times with the kids.

169
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,151
Goldfish, parakeets, turtles...

170
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,158
No. A cat is different.

171
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,995
Yeah, you can't flush a cat.

172
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,999
I know you're not going to
believe this, but I do admire you.

173
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,997
I believe it.

174
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,954
You are so tough. You keep
your head up, no matter what.

175
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,596
How do you do that?

176
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,837
I'll tell you.
I always look on the bright side.

177
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,996
No matter how lousy a situation is,

178
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,839
I can always find something in it
to make me happy.

179
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,796
What good could you possibly say
about a loved one dying?

180
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,519
It ain't me.

181
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,398
Extra points. We've still got time.

182
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,670
- Terrific.
- Yeah, terrific.

183
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,678
Swish! Larry Bird got another one!

184
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,880
- Another one, already?
- Another one, already?

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,390
- They're only down by three.
- Shoot the inbound pass!

186
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,397
Three seconds, shoot it!

187
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,318
Damn, he missed!

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,193
- We lost!
- Alright!

189
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,160
Pitcher's elbow. I lose control of it
during intense moments of sorrow.

190
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,549
Coach, I think if I went out
and got a breath of fresh air,

191
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,114
it might fight back these tears.
Wanna join me?

192
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,515
- No, I feel terrific.
- Join me!

193
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,995
Yeah, I do feel a cry coming on.

194
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,438
Yeah. Boy, they're really
taking it hard.

195
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,989
- Did you ever lose a pet?
- Like an animal?

196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,750
Yeah.

197
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,793
I never had a pet. My grandfather
had a dog that I loved very much.

198
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,073
- What did you call him?
- Grandpa.

199
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,629
- I meant the dog.
- The dog? Bruno.

200
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,510
- What happened to him?
- Fell down in the bathtub and died.

201
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,793
- I meant the dog.
- So did I.

202
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,836
My grandfather, poor old guy,
got run over by a bus.

203
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,919
You know something? Nobody's ever
listened to my story before.

204
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,237
It's good to get it off your chest.

205
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,309
If ever I can be there for you,
just let me know and I'll be there.

206
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,112
- Actually...
- Excuse me.

207
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,598
Jack Daniel's.

208
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,678
Miss, I ordered this on the rocks.

209
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,593
No!

210
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,231
It's not that bad, really.
Sweetheart, it's no problem.

211
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,549
I'm sorry. I like it this way. Look!

212
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,796
Good, good!

213
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,190
Darling? Miss?

214
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,197
Here's a tip for you.

215
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,394
Five bucks for a couple of tears?

216
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,996
I can't believe you're that upset
over an animal dying.

217
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,513
You obviously have never had a pet.

218
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,596
I have, too.

219
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,995
- What?
- I had a dog.

220
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,712
Cutest little guy!
Floppy ears, big eyes.

221
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,195
I took him for a walk every morning.

222
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,637
Great way to meet women.

223
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,030
So you loved this dog because
you could use him as a come-on?

224
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,118
- No!
- I bet you can't remember his name.

225
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,390
Sure I do! It was Fluffy.

226
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,598
Or Buffy.

227
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,791
Or was that one of the girls
he helped me to meet?

228
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,354
Come on! What is it you want?

229
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,471
I wanted a little sympathy.

230
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,632
Why didn't you say so?

231
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,911
Sam, there are subtleties
of expression.

232
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,794
I have been saying so all day
with the look in my eye,

233
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,070
the knit of my brow, my posture...

234
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,794
How come you just don't use words?

235
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,396
No.

236
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,035
- No, I'm gonna sympathise.
- Don't be ridiculous!

237
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,913
- Tell me about your cat.
- I don't want to talk about it.

238
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,996
Well, tough!

239
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,913
Well, I was...

240
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,550
..pretty lonely as a child.

241
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,952
I wasn't close
to anyone in my family.

242
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,913
My father travelled frequently,

243
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,192
and my mother was incredibly social.

244
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,758
So Elizabeth was
my closest friend and confidante.

245
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,600
That cat could really keep a secret.

246
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,198
- That's good in a cat.
- Yeah.

247
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,991
She was the only one in my life
who was always there.

248
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,473
When everybody was mad at me,
she liked me.

249
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,798
When I'd hide when my parents argued,
she'd come with me.

250
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,959
Whenever I was sick, she never
left my bed until I was well again.

251
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,998
And then,...

252
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,790
..when I was 12 years old,
my parents separated.

253
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,593
It was maybe
the worst night of my life.

254
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,071
I actually thought about
throwing myself in the lake.

255
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,795
But then I looked down
at this cat in my lap

256
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,993
and I thought,
"Who would take care of Elizabeth?"

257
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,837
She saved my life that night.

258
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,918
And I know,
it's crazy and irrational,

259
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,989
but, Sam, I can't help thinking
that last night, when her time came,

260
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,509
she must have wondered where I was.

261
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,398
- Sam, you're crying.
- No, I'm not.

262
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,874
Yes, you are. Your eyes are all red

263
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,991
and your nose is running.

264
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,313
I'm allergic to cat stories.

265
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,519
I can't believe this.

266
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,995
Sam, this is so sweet.

267
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,190
You poor kid.

268
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,793
Wait.

269
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,392
What are we doing?

270
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,951
We're sharing our grief.

271
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,154
This doesn't feel like sharing grief.

272
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,350
Grief's kind of a tricky thing.
Shall we get back to it?

273
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,554
Sam, you're exploiting this situation
and it just doesn't feel right to me.

274
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,832
What? Exploiting?

275
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,832
We got caught up
in some wonderful emotions just now,

276
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,714
and I would hate to see that
turned into something sexual.

277
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,594
- What are you accusing me of?
- I'm not accusing you of anything.

278
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,598
I would just like to know
why this is happening.

279
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,917
What difference does it make,
why it's happening?

280
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,157
We're helpless, swept away.
What else can we do?

281
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,191
Sam!

282
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,989
You have never been helpless
where women are involved.

283
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,792
Jeez!

284
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,198
Your problem is that the only way
you can relate to women is sexually.

285
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,356
You wanna know what your problem is?

286
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,109
You always have to think
about things, talk about things.

287
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,549
"Why are we doing this?
What does it mean?"

288
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,797
"What are we going to do?"
God, it makes me so mad!

289
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,278
An unexamined life
is not worth living.

290
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,111
While we're talking about problems,

291
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,231
you want to know
what bugs me about you?

292
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,079
- Fine.
- The way you eat pretzels.

293
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,679
- Pretzels?
- That's right.

294
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,554
Three bites. Not two, not one,
like the rest of us. Three!

295
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,433
- Know what bugs me about you?
- What?

296
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,599
The cologne you always wear
is totally without nuance!

297
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,873
That explains
the laughter behind my back!

298
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,232
I don't know why I talk to you. Every
conversation we have is an ordeal.

299
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,319
So let's not have any more.
And I tell you something else.

300
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,908
You won't catch me
coming on to you again.

301
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,191
- You're right you won't.
- We agree on something.

302
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,995
No, I think we agree
on one other thing.

303
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,396
- I am getting the hell out of here.
- Two things.

304
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,432
- Diane! Wait!
- What is it?

305
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,711
- I'm sorry about your cat.
- Thank you.

306
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,113
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

307
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,590
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Alright.
