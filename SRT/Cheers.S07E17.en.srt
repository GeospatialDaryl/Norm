    ( <i>knuckles crack</i> )

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,609
Eww! Knuckle cracking.

5
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,176
I hate that sound.

6
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,311
And you hurt your fingers.

7
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:14,345
CLIFF:  
                        Woodrow,

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,681
knuckle cracking                
is relatively harmless.

9
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:17,866
Actually,

10
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,201
when you                        
crack your knuckles,

11
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:22,070
what you're doing is really,    
uh, breaking a sound barrier.

12
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:24,639
Yeah, what you hear             
is actually

13
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:27,709
a tiny finger-sized             
sonic boom.

14
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:29,444
Well, Cliff,          
      you're partly right.

15
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:32,047
Really? Which part?

16
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:35,317
The phenomenon of knuckle       
cracking is relatively harmless.

17
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,952
But in fact,          
    the sound you're hearing

18
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:38,753
is not a cracking at all,

19
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:41,589
but rather a popping      
      of tiny gas bubbles

20
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,790
imploding               
     in the sinovial fluid

    phalangeal joint.

22
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:45,827

00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,229
NORM:       
                    Yeah, but

24
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:49,397
knuckle-cracking        
 doesn't make a popping sound.

25
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,866
A popping sound         
    is more like this.

00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,869

I could never do that.

28
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:54,836
You know what else              
I could never do?

29
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,604
I could never whistle           
with my fingers.

30
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:57,739
Carla can do that great.

31

Hey, Carla, show Woody

00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,009
Sure.

34
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:01,726
First, you have                 
to crack your knuckles.

I hate that sound!

38

can you help me                 
with this zipper, please?

Sure, boss.

50
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,068
You know, when you first        
walked in in this dress,

51
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:04,071
you were like the closest thing 
to Cher I've ever seen.

53
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,442

Carla, I don't    
              have time to trade

55
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:10,645
Oh, that's okay.

56
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,647
You can still keep mine.

There you go.

00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:15,683

                any lousy excuse

153
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:43,424
like heart surgery.

154
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,192
As a matter of fact,
            she's very sick.

155
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:47,078
Sick of you.

156
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,413
( <i>both screaming</i> )

157
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,065
REBECCA:      
                  Well, you have

158
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,132
a good time     
                tonight, Sam.

159
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,668
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  
            Listen.

160
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:54,969
Here we are,

161
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:57,037
both dolled up,         
 looking like a million bucks.

162
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:58,973
What do you say                 
the two of us storm

163
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:01,241
the old USS <i>Constitution</i>        
<i>together, huh?</i>

164
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,910
I don't think so.

165
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,647
Oh, are you so depressed        
about being stood up?

166
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:07,648
No.

167
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,149
I just don't want           
        to go with you.

168
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:10,751
Wait a minute.

169
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:13,087
You spent all day               
getting dressed up

170
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,455
and you're trying               
to tell me

171
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,156
that you'd rather stay          
in this bar

172
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,191
than go out with me?

173
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,693
No, Sam,

174
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:19,760
I am trying to tell you

175
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,462
that I would rather       
remove my own gall bladder

176
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:25,032
with an oyster fork       
     than go out with you.

177
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,121
Why do you say                  
these things to me?

178
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:32,257
I mean, how come                
I turn you off so much?

179
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,524
I don't know.

180
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:34,558
It's just one  
                 of those things

181
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:35,559
you have            
            to take on faith.

182
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:36,928
It's kind of like   
            I don't know

183
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:38,629
that the refrigerator   
        light goes off

184
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:40,098
for sure when       
            I close the door.

185
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,268
Well, obviously you never tried 
  closing it from the inside.

186
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,576
Hey, everybody.

187
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,678
Guess who I brought
             back with me?

188
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,196
Sam, how'd you do it?

189
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,964
The doorman at the Ritz Carlton.

190
00:06:58,467 --> 00:06:59,634
CLIFF:    
                      Good Lord,

191
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,452
that's             
 Admiral William J. Crowe, Jr.

192
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,354
Chairman of the Joint       
    Chiefs of Staff, himself.

193
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,489
WOODY:            
              Now wait a minute.

194
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,474
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
            of Staff

195
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,209
is a doorman          
      at the Ritz Carlton?

196
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,430
No wonder they charge you       
      so much over there.

197
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,466
Woody, this really          
        is the Chairman

198
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,367
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

199
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,069
He was at the same dinner I was.

200
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:21,038
The Navy can't afford to pay  
the salary of a doorman, Woody.

201
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,306
You know that.

202
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,577
He recognized me        
from my ball-playing days.

203
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,245
Nobody gives up tearing     
home runs like Sam Malone.

204
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,131
Thanks.

205
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,666
I wish our missiles       
    flew as high and as far.

206
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,671
Admiral                         
William J. Crow, Jr.,

207
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,339
promoted to Admiral             
in 1974.

208
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,641
In 1983 commanded               
U.S. Pacific Command.

209
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:44,778
In 1985, appointed 11th Chairman
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

210
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:46,380
Wife, Shirley.

211
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:47,564
I'm impressed,
                  young man.

212
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,000
How come you know   
            so much about me?

213
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,769
Simple, sir. I'm an American.

214
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,941
Clifford Clavin,                
U.S. Postal Service, sir.

215
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,742
Nice to know you,           
          Mr. Clavin.

216
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,945
Us guys in uniform    
          got to stick together.

217
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,146
Yes, sir.

218
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,080
Were you ever   
                in the Navy?

219
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,765
No, sir, I wanted to be

220
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,501
but the old asthma          
 started kicking up, you know.

221
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,504
So, uh, so I joined       
the U.S. Postal Service instead.

222
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:12,072
I figured if I couldn't serve

223
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:14,442
I should at least           
deliver the draft notices

224
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:17,261
to those who could.

225
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,830
Admiral, hi.

226
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:20,648
Hi.

227
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:21,666
I'm Rebecca Howe.

228
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,501
It is truly an honor            
to have you

229
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,803
in our bar.

230
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,772
It's an honor  
                 for me as well.

231
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,007
Is there anything               
I can do for you?               
Anything at all?

232
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,643
Well, for starters,
             you might go out   
             with Sam Malone.

233
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,545
I hate to see a man
             in constant pain.

234
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,832
Maybe you could ask me

235
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,735
to do something                 
more enjoyable.

236
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,970
Like, say, a commando mission   
in Libya?

237
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,506
I tried, Sam.

238
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,443
Hey, Ad, park it.

239
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:53,197
I'm Carla Tortelli LeBec.

240
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,298
Hello, Carla.

241
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,684
I was wondering if              
I could ask you a favor.

242
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:57,785
Sure.

243
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,754
If you're ever                  
on the USS <i>Lexington,</i>

244
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:02,222
could you find out              
why nobody has ever called

245
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:05,359
or dropped a note               
or sent a card?

246
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,562
That must be        
            a hell of a ship.

247
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,346
I've had better.

248
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:16,137
Oh, well, well, well.

249
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,038
What do we have here?

250
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:21,042
The Chairman                    
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

251
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,243
Mm-hmm.

252
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,013
Hello there, sir.

253
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,114
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

254
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,115
Hello, Doctor.

255
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,682
This is my number.

256
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:31,486
I have treated Napoleon,        
Teddy Roosevelt,

257
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,687
and I know I could help you.

258
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,026
Doctor, I really am the Chairman
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

259
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,561
Aye, aye, Admiral.

260
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,362
But I'll keep your card.

261
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:43,831
I know a lot of people     
        in the Pentagon

262
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,032
that could use your services.

263
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,524
Hey, Admiral, thanks.

264
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,292
These are great hats.

265
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,145
Hats don't win wars;            
ideas do.

266
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,413
Now sir,                        
here's what separates

267
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,166
my submarine concept            
from everybody else's.

268
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,270
You see, mine's got wheels.

269
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:11,992
Uh, I understand, Cliff.

270
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:14,762
It's getting late.

271
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,847
Sam, thanks                     
for the autographed baseball.

272
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:17,848
Oh, yeah, listen.

273
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,049
If the President                
wants one of those,

274
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,050
he knows where to get me.

275
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,469
I'm sure you'll     
            be hearing from him.

276
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,570
Norm...

277
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,638
Later.

278
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:26,840
Uh, sir, these plans
            I've drawn up

279
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,642
for the new     
                assault vehicle,

280
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,244
where should
                    I send them?

281
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,396
Just send them to the Pentagon, 
             Cliff.

282
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,030
Yes, sir.

283
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,849
Sir, I'm a little bit

284
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,100
worried about that,
             though.

285
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,602
If I send them  
                to the Pentagon,

286
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,103
they might get lost.

287
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,273
Very definitely         
send them to the Pentagon.

288
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,009
Yes, sir.

289
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,344
Am I lucky or what?

290
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,914
One of the most
                 famous people  
                 in the country

291
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:53,017
comes into my bar,      
        and I am dressed for it.

292
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:53,985
By the way, Rebecca,

293
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,987
when are you going              
to take that thing off?

294
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,088
Oh, I might just dress this way 
         all the time.

295
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:01,392
It makes me feel all at once  
  desirable and businesslike.

296
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,293
You got a point.

297
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,945
About a half dozen guys asked me
how much you charge.

298
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:08,783
By the way, if anyone   
        says "Carla sent me,"

299
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,050
you owe me five bucks.

300
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:13,287
Carla, I'm just about           
to have a break.

301
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,455
You think you can               
teach me

302
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,058
to make raspberry sounds        
with my armpit?

303
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:18,325
No, no, I've got

304
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,028
to be wearing a tank top
        to get the full effect.

305
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:25,566
But you know,      
             I can teach you how

306
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,501
to make blue sparks
             in your mouth

307
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,003
with a Lifesaver candy.

308
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,939
They're gone!

309
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:32,622
Who's gone?

310
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:35,142
My diamond earrings.      
         They're gone.

311
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,376
Calm down.              
     Where'd you put them?

312
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,913
I had them in a tumbler,    
    and I put it on my desk,

313
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:40,180
and nobody                      
was in there but me.

314
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:41,749
And my door was locked          
the whole time

315
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,617
and I was the only one          
that was in there.

316
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:44,919
No, no, the Admiral went    
in there to use the phone.

317
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,823
You're right.

318
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:51,058
He was in there alone.

319
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,793
Oh, Lord.

320
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:56,463
The Chairman of the Joint   
    Chiefs of Staff

321
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,465
of the United States
            of America,

322
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,667
stole my earrings!

323
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:13,964
Oh! I just don't believe this!

324
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:17,367
And he seemed like              
such a nice Chairman

325
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,137
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

326
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,388
Rebecca Howe,          
    this smacks of treason.

327
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:22,422
I've got                        
a good mind

328
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,791
to place you under arrest.

329
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,876
Cliff, if you                   
had a good mind,

330
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,878
you would                       
still be stupid.

331
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,213
SAM:            
                Hey, come on.

332
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,282
Why would anyone who
            has a super job,

333
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,482
makes a great living,

334
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,518
and can shop at     
            any PX in the world,

335
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,086
want to steal   
                your earrings?

336
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,955
You saw them.          
      They were gorgeous.

337
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,223
CLIFF:                          
All right,                      
that's it.

338
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:43,760
Rebecca Howe, I would like      
  your social security number.

339
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:44,761
Oh, Cliff, shut up.

340
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:45,930
NORM:       
                    All right,  
                    wait, wait.

341
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,064
Maybe he did take them.

342
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,099
Oh, great.              
    Seditionists everywhere.

343
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:51,402
No, no. Maybe the guy had       
an anniversary coming up,

344
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,038
and he didn't have time to shop 
because he's too damn busy

345
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,039
running the military.

346
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,507
No, no. That doesn't wash, Norm.

347
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:00,010
His anniversary   
              was February 14th.

348
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:00,477
All right, Cliff.   
            All right.

349
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:01,611
Maybe this, okay?

350
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,547
Maybe he wears  
                them himself.

351
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,749
Yeah, right.                    
He wears earrings

352
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,851
and I wear                      
women's lingerie.

353
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,120
Carla,          
                you were right.

354
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,858
REBECCA:                        
I don't care

355
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:15,526
why he did it.

356
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,979
The fact is that        
     my earrings are gone,

357
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:19,646
and the admiral took them.

358
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:20,581
Oh, come on.

359
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:21,582
This is silly.

360
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:23,017
Let's just go          
      in your office here

361
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,018
and look for them.

362
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,086
I have looked for them.

363
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,587
I told you,             
        they're not in there!

364
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,555
I'm calling the police. 
Oh, don't do that.

365
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,240
Well, now that      
            we're through       
            being interrupted,

366
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,025
let's get down to       
        real serious matters.

367
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,811
Carla, you can't
                make blue sparks

368
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,113
come out of your mouth  
        with a Lifesaver.

369
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,650
Well, not just                  
any Lifesaver.

370
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,987
A magic Wint-o-green            
Lifesaver.

371
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:44,788
Oh, now, Carla, don't prey      
     on their gullibility.

372
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,156
There's nothing magical     
        about it.

373
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,291
It's just a simple              
chemical reaction.

374
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,593
When you crunch down      
        on a Lifesaver,

375
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,162
electrons strike        
      nitrogen molecules,

376
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,664
which causes the latter

377
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,066
to emit an invisible       
     ultraviolet radiation

378
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,168
which, when absorbed      
    by the methyl salicilate

379
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,839
in the Wintergreen flavoring,  
produces a flash of blue light.

380
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,874
Makes sense.

381
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,843
I find that                     
when you say that

382
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,945
to Dr. Crane,                   
he stops talking.

383
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,501
See? They're
                    not here.

384
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,203
I told you,         
            they are no here!

385
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:18,472
Calm down. Will you             
calm down, please?

386
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,174
I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm!

387
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,708
What's the number for 911?

388
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,677
You are not going               
to call the police.

389
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,447
Sam, I have told you    
        to remove your hand     
        from many a location,

390
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,382
but I have          
            never been more     
            serious than now.

391
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.         
Come on. Back off here.

392
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,987
They're earrings.               
You'll buy another pair.

393
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:34,188
Oh, yeah. Right!

394
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:35,990
What are you                    
going to do?

395
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:37,224
Spot me $32,000?

396
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:40,177
American money?

397
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,047
I didn't exactly        
      buy those earrings.

398
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,017
I told the man                  
at Shreve, Crump & Lowe

399
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:47,952
that I just wanted

400
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,670
to take them out        
        for the evening

401
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,273
to make sure that I really,   
      really wanted them.

402
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,475
I don't think that dress    
      is meant to do that.

403
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,396
And then I was going to just

404
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,263
wear them tonight,

405
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:00,964
and look really                 
beautiful, you know?

406
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,367
Then I was going                
to take them back               
in the morning.

407
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,003
But... God. Shreve  
            is holding all      
            my credit cards,

408
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:07,421
the pink slip to my Mercedes,

409
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,223
and my mom and dad's      
         phone number.

410
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:12,292
Uh-oh. Good chance you could  
      be sent to your room

411
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,194
for five to 15 years.

412
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:15,779
You know,               
you're really not helping.

413
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,013
Just get out of here.

414
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,967
God! I would
                    do anything

415
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,668
to get those    
                earrings back.

416
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,133
Yes, Sam,               
  I am exactly that desperate.

417
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,802
I don't care what it takes.

418
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,771
Go to the admiral's hotel room,

419
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,740
sneak in there         
and steal those earrings.

420
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:46,543
Just get them back for me and, 
    yes, Lord help me,

421
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,880
I will go to bed with you.

422
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:53,918
I'm going to turn           
    this joint upside down.

423
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,152
Starting with you.              
                    Sam!

424
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,487
All right,                      
all right, all right.

425
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,121
<i>Ending</i> with you.

426
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,659
I saw it!

427
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:05,329
Blue sparks         
            in Carla's mouth!

428
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,031
Hey, guys. Listen, fellas.

429
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,832
Am I interrupting anything?

430
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,602
Just science making             
another leap forward.

431
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,604
Fellas, listen. All right,      
    come here. Listen.

432
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,772
Come here. Listen.              
I need your help here now.

433
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:17,974
I want to get my hands     
      on Rebecca's jewels

434
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,076
but, first, I've got       
     to find her earrings.

435
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:23,213
All right, Sammy,           
      we're here for you.

436
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,949
All right. Now,                 
I guess we could

437
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,083
buy her another pair,

438
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,419
but that would set us back      
        about 32 grand.

439
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:31,622
Not here for you, Sam.     
    Left an hour ago.

440
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,291
All right, all right.           
Now, there's got to be...

441
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,759
See, I figure       
            that she probably

442
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,927
just put them down someplace  
        for safekeeping,

443
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,630
and then forgot         
      where she put them.

444
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:42,432
I got to just find a way to,    
you know, jog her memory.

445
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,334
I... I know                     
what we should do.              
                    What?

446
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,835
I saw this in a movie once.

447
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,938
We gather the suspects     
all together in one room.

448
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:50,657
Right. And then                 
you recreate the crime

449
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:53,294
so that you can work backwards  
and find out what happened.

450
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,228
Yeah.                   
                    Let's go.

451
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,262
Hey, Sammy, uh...

452
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,598
since I'm the only one          
here in uniform,

453
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,467
I suggest                       
I play Admiral Crowe.

454
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,002
Well, if you're Admiral Crowe, 
 who's going to be Mr. Clavin?

455
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:04,037
Aw, any of you yutzes           
can handle that.

456
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,330
( <i>Sam clears his throat</i> )

457
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:16,467
What are you all doing in here?

458
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,335
Well, Cliff here has agreed

459
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,637
to portray Admiral Crowe    
        so we can

460
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,106
recreate the alleged crime

461
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,908
so we can figure out      
         what happened.

462
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:26,543
And what about you two guys?

463
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,446
We're witnesses.

464
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah, we're                     
pretty much

465
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,483
just gonna hang                 
around and... and watch.

466
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,818
That's a stretch.

467
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:37,504
SAM:        
                    Okay, uh...

468
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:40,841
Admiral Crowe came in      
  and asked to use the phone.

469
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,343
What did he say?

470
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,778
"May I use the phone?"

471
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,997
Excuse me, Rebecca.       
        That's my line.

472
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,553
Then what?

473
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:55,255
And I said, "Sure,"       
    and he said, "Thank you.

474
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:58,174
Huh. Look who thinks      
      she's Admiral Crowe.

475
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,764
All right.

476
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,099
Now, he came in here,      
         he was alone.

477
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:07,768
Was he              
            carrying anything?

478
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:10,437
Uh... I think he was carrying  
    a glass of water.

479
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,938
I see.

480
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:14,441
And did he put this 
            glass of water down?

481
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,942
I think so.

482
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:20,181
Next to, perhaps,   
            this glass?

483
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:21,348
Ooh!

484
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,417
I see what you're               
getting at, Sam.

485
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,519
You think that                  
he picked up                    
the other glass

486
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:28,555
with the earrings               
in it and took it out.

487
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:31,325
Yeah, right. Absolutely.

488
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,061
Guys, we're out of here.

489
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:38,498
Hey, I didn't   
                get to portray  
                Admiral Crowe.

490
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:40,000
Uh... all right. Uh...

491
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,485
Rebecca,                        
as a favor for Cliff,

492
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,887
what was the last words         
the Admiral said? Anything?

493
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,756
Yes. Before he left, he said,

494
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,759
"I want to get out of this bar 
        as fast as I can

495
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,328
before I run into           
     that stupid mailman."

496
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:54,248
He stole them,  
                all right.

497
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:55,548
Wait.

498
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,633
You were supposed

499
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,268
to help me find my earrings.  
            Come on!

500
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:00,403
Yeah. Look what I found         
in this dirty old glass.

501
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:03,006
Oh! Oh!

502
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,242
Oh! You are     
                such an angel!

503
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,712
Oh, how can         
            I ever thank you?

504
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:13,133
I think the how has             
already been established.

505
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:20,423
We're up to where               
and how often.

506
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:28,848
Well... a promise is a promise.

507
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,251
Come on. I hate that.

508
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:32,819
I hate it                       
when you do that.

509
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:35,289
Come on. What...                
what's wrong with you?

510
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:37,057
Why... why                      
don't you want me?

511
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:38,392
What's the problem?

512
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:39,560
You know, Sam, I really...

513
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,462
I just don't know           
     why I don't want you.

514
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:43,363
Well, think,                    
damn it!

515
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,802
I think it's just one      
     of those things that,

516
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,136
when you first meet a guy,

517
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:53,173
you put him in one of three   
 categories-- yes, no or maybe.

518
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,741
From the second 
                I saw you,

519
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,710
I threw you right           
     in that "no" category,

520
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,979
and that's where        
you've stayed ever since.

521
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,315
I mean, when    
                Sam Malone walks
                into a room,

522
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,050
I say "no" and go on      
         with my life.

523
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,586
Every single time?

524
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,239
No. There was this one time,

525
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,907
when you were way down      
    at the end of the hall,

526
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:14,345
and I could just see this tiny 
  little piece of your elbow,

527
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,747
and I didn't know for sure      
         if it was you.

528
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:20,100
And I thought   
                to myself, hmm.

529
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,668
And then you came           
    around the corner,

530
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:23,870
and I thought, "God, no!"

531
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,477
"God, no" is a lot worse    
    than just no, isn't it?

532
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,846
Sam, wait. I want       
        to ask you something.

533
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,449
And I want an answer to this.

534
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,017
Why do you care?

535
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,502
Why do you want me?

536
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,304
I... I have never           
     given you any reason.

537
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:42,539
I've never come on to you.

538
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,007
Why do you keep hitting on me?

539
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,530
Uh... I don't know. I...

540
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:52,699
I guess that I...           
    when I meet women,

541
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:56,270
I put them into one       
      of three categories.

542
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:58,121
Oh, who am I kidding?

543
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:00,857
I put them into one category.

544
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,761
Boy, I guess          
      I shouldn't do that.

545
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,464
I mean, that's         
    not really fair to you.

546
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,365
I'm sorry.

547
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,218
Thank you, Sam.

548
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,554
I know that wasn't easy     
        for you to say.

549
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,773
I haven't been

550
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,058
real fair myself.

551
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:20,960
I mean, I haven't           
really given you a chance.

552
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,545
Don't worry about it.

553
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,281
I mean...               
Gee, I wish we could just

554
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,451
start all over                  
again, you know?

555
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,421
Just wipe all this              
junk out of the way.

556
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,423
I like that idea.

557
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,991
Yeah, I mean, it's,             
like, if I could

558
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,927
see you for                     
the first time,

559
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:39,095
I'd look over there             
and I'd...

560
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,398
well, I'd see                   
a beautiful woman.

561
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,167
Thank you.

562
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,470
And I'd see you, and I'd see  
    a real good-looking guy.

563
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,573
With... with nice hair.

564
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:53,760
Right.

565
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:55,529
Say it.

566
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,832
With nice hair.

567
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:00,934
Thank you.

568
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,135
And broad shoulders and...

569
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:04,637
a pleasant smile.

570
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,024
Nice hair again.

571
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,160
Aw, see, you're...

572
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:11,528
you're patronizing me.

573
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:14,097
No, I'm not. I am   
            not patronizing you.

574
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,799
We said we were going      
         to be honest.

575
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,433
I think you're         
    an attractive guy.

576
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:19,936
I think you're      
            cute enough to kiss.

577
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,621
I mean, if I didn't know you.

578
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:22,956
Yeah, yeah...                   
if you didn't know me.

579
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,924
All right, what?

580
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,692
You want me to  
                prove it to you

581
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:27,193
that I think
                    you're cute?

582
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:28,194
All right, fine.

583
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:29,629
I will prove it to you.

584
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:32,632
I will dispel the myth     
that you turn my stomach.

585
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,568
I will give you a little kiss.

586
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:36,720
Here.

587
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:38,722
There.

588
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,868
Now, what category              
am I in?

589
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,971
Yes?

590
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:56,573
No?

591
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,842
Oh, geez.

592
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:02,212
Why do I even                   
bother with you?

593
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:06,683
Ooh! A definite maybe.

594
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,651
I heard that.

595
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:10,887

00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:12,105
You said maybe!

00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,858

599
00:23:16,243 --> 00:23:17,744
I said that you kiss      
      like my Uncle Abey!

600
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,462
No, no, no.

601
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:22,515

      you gave me rabies!
