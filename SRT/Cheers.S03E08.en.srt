00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,917
DlANE MEETS MOM

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,916
- Hello.
- Hi, what can l get you?

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,473
- l'm a phone company repairman.
- l'm a bartender. Ernie Pantusso.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,916
Phil Ryan.
l got a call to come down here.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,709
There must be some mistake, Phil.
l didn't call for any repairman.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,599
- l think Sam put in a call, Coach.
- He did?

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,115
He didn't say anything to me.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,114
l'd better give him a call
and find out what this is all about.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,356
Bum luck, Phil, phone's out.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,197
Give him a couple of seconds.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,834
l hate to impose, but since they
got you here on this royal goose chase,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,116
would you take a look at the phone?

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,669
- Sure.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,758
Lucky thing he happened by here.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,549
Sometimes fate takes a hand, Coach.

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,115
Hi, everybody. l bet you're surprised
to see me on my night off.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,192
Yeah, we didn't hear your broom pull up.

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,718
What are you doing here?

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,634
l'm having dinner upstairs
with Frasier and his mother.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,429
She's a seafood aficionado,
we think she'll like the bouillabaisse.

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,751
You're having dinner
with Frasier's mother?

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,071
You deduced l'm having dinner
with Frasier and his mother

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,038
when all l did
was say it in your presence.

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,397
No flash cards, no crib notes
on your sleeve? Uncanny.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,755
We're a little edgy tonight, aren't we?

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,674
But l can't blame you. Meeting Mom
is a big step in a relationship.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,356
Granted, meeting your prospective
fiancé's mother,

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,548
especially an eminent psychiatrist,
trained to analyse a person's behaviour,

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,678
could be a nerve-racking evening,

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,389
for somebody who's going to be there,
but l'm not. Good night.

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,238
- Chickening out, Diane? - Not at all.
They're 1 2 seconds late.

32
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,234
Get back here.
Sit down and have a glass of wine.

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,958
Coach...

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,471
Sit down, honey, and relax.
Everything will be fine.

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,110
Just remember, don't snap your gum,
don't chew with your mouth open,

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,159
and for God's sake,
don't play with your bra straps.

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,671
- l'll try to remember.
- Trying's not good enough.

38
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,559
l'll have to write it down for you.

39
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,789
- What would you say to a nice beer?
- Going down.

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,193
Coach, do me a favour and don't make
a big fuss over me today, OK?

42
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,638
- You got it.
- No cakes, candles, party hats, singing.

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,439
- None of that.
- OK.

44
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,630
You know, because it would be
so embarrassing.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,234
And no gifts, all right?

46
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,954
And don't ask how old l am today.

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
Normie, is today your birthday?

48
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,229
Coach, you remembered?

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,876
Everybody, it's Normie's birthday.

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,310
Let me buy the birthday boy a drink.

51
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,313
Please, you're making
too big a deal out of this.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,430
There you are, my darling.
At last you two meet.

53
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,637
The woman who gave me life
and the woman who gives me life.

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,268
Oh, Frasier.

55
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,830
Forgive me. l lose my head
in the company of beautiful women.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,675
- Dr Crane...
- Oh, please, dear, call me Hester.

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,150
- Hester, it's a pleasure.
- lt's my pleasure.

58
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,390
Let me take your coat, Mother.

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,870
Diane...

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,669
- Here's the list of tips l promised.
- Thank you, Coach.

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,073
l also added instructions
for a dainty way to dispose of gristle.

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,236
Frasier, she's lovely.

63
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,356
He's made no secret of the fact,
but even he didn't do you justice.

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,878
Well, in an anxiety-provoking situation
such as this,

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,716
one tends to respond with exaggerated
compliments. Let me just be frank.

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,078
You are the most strikingly handsome
woman l've ever laid eyes on.

67
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,629
Something exciting is happening here.
Exciting, but not surprising.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,110
l say by the end of the evening
you two will be thick as thieves.

69
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,034
Only if we can't resist the temptation
to pig out on cheesecake.

70
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,314
- Hey, Doc, Vic's ready for you upstairs.
- l hope everybody's got an appetite.

71
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,153
l'll never eat again.

72
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,672
Let me hurry on up and make sure we've
got a good table. l'm thick with Vic.

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,239
Well, Mother...

74
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,154
- Boy, did you see that?
- What?

75
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,949
Frasier purposely avoided
drawing me into the conversation.

76
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,430
l noticed that, too, Cliffie.
What's his problem?

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,672
He knows how well versed
l am in his field, Coach.

78
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,196
l've embarrassed
many a professional so-called expert.

79
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,672
Actually, Cliff, l think you've
embarrassed everybody you know.

80
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,469
As long as you're saying it,
it's not bragging.

81
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,952
- Norm! When did you get here?
- 36 years ago today.

82
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,430
- lt's my buddy Norm's birthday today.
- ls that right?

83
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,434
l think the birthday of one of my best
customers deserves some bubbly.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,512
- No, no, no.
- Maybe you're right.

85
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,513
- Just kidding!
- You got me!

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,639
Open this up, Coach. Congratulations,
and many happy returns.

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,314
Just don't go singing ''Happy Birthday''.

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,916
Cos l'd really hate that,
if you sang ''Happy Birthday''.

89
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,036
Yeah, just because it is my...

90
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,516
Cut it out! Come on, now!

91
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,875
- Norm!
- Are you OK?

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,032
- You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, yeah. l'm all right.

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,555
That sucker nearly hit me.

94
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,116
Hold still now.

95
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,993
Why don't you
sit down here for a second?

96
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,196
- You all right?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,316
- How many fingers?
- Three.

98
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,472
- Not you, Coach.
- Three.

99
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,313
Sure, after l give him the answer.

100
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,436
- You sure?
- l'm fine.

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,239
The primary symptom
of postprandial trauma

102
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,709
is the blurring of the metatarsals.

103
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,917
- Cliff, shut up.
- Fine, l'll shut up.

104
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,959
Go ahead and wallow in ignorance.
We're re-entering the Dark Ages.

105
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,272
- Do we gain an hour or lose an hour?
- Would you guys cut it out?

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,671
Why don't you see a doctor?
That thing hit you pretty hard.

107
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,071
Play it safe, go to the emergency room.
l'll pay for it.

108
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,708
No, it doesn't even hurt any more.

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,718
Normie's right. l got hit all the time
in baseball. l never saw a doctor.

110
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,758
- You'll keep my glass chilled?
- Yeah.

111
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,036
Yeah, terrific, Normie, l'll pass that on.

112
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,395
Everybody, Normie's just fine.

113
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,791
They're just keeping him in
overnight for a few more tests.

114
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,115
A lot of people miss the whimsy in Jung.
He's given me many a chuckle.

115
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,037
l wrote one of my favourite papers on it.
lt's entitled, ''Hello, Jung Lovers.''

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,150
How clever.

117
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,195
Oh, dear. l hope l haven't dominated
the conversation tonight.

118
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,592
Nonsense, the wine and your verbiage
went perfectly with our meal.

119
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,392
Listen, why don't you two have
a seat and l'll get us a fine cordial.

120
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,394
Will you trust me to make the selection?
l have a little treat in mind,

121
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,516
l'd like to surprise you with it.

122
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,148
Frasier, you're mad, but l love you.

123
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,390
Three cans of Schlitz.

124
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,796
Listen carefully.

125
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,114
Stop seeing my son or,
as God is my witness, l'll kill you.

126
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,278
- Something to munch on.
- Yum, yum, yum.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,675
Now listen to me.
l have a gun, l know how to use it.

128
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,316
Here we are.

129
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,677
Doesn't that look lovely?
What do you call it?

130
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,392
- lt's a delightful pear liqueur.
- Sounds delicious, doesn't it, Diane?

131
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,276
l think she likes it.

132
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,035
l hate to leave your company again,
but l must visit the men's room.

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,875
You know what they say, you only rent
a Château Lafite Rothschild.

134
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,996
l'll go with you.

135
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,516
Diane, there are some things
a man must do alone.

136
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,956
lf you love me, you won't do this now.

137
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,079
Well, it's a peculiar test
of a man's affection,

138
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,595
but l think l'm up to it.

139
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,830
l've just had an inspiration.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,231
What say we go to an intimate cabaret
and hear some jazz?

141
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,633
That's a wonderful idea, Frasier.
How do you feel about it, Diane?

142
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,469
Diane, you're white as a sheet.
Are you OK?

143
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,596
l'm a little tired, Frasier.

144
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,036
- Why don't you two go without me?
- We wouldn't think of it.

145
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,839
No, l insist.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,039
l'll be fine. l'll call a cab. l wouldn't want
to spoil your fun. Please.

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,714
She's tired. Don't press her.

148
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,758
Go home, dear. Rest.

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,277
You need a night on the town
like you need a hole in the head.

150
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,712
l'll be fine, thank you.

151
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,912
Very well. l'll call you later.

152
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,789
- How did dinner go?
- She wants to kill me.

153
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,475
You've got to start picking up
some checks, Diane.

154
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,917
Sam, l have to ask you a question.

155
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,311
And promise me
you won't make a joke out of it. OK?

156
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,235
- l promise. What's up?
- Do you think l'm crazy?

157
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,913
Yes.

158
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,716
Now the joke is out of the way,
will you help me?

159
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,917
l know this is a strange question,
but it's important.

160
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,833
Do you think l'm...crazy?

161
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,671
Yes.

162
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,708
You're incapable of a rational
conversation, only flip remarks.

163
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,431
Wait a minute. Do you mean
are you crazy, like seriously unbalanced,

164
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,875
like losing your grasp on reality?

165
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,429
- Yes.
- Oh, well, then...

166
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,477
...yes.

167
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,636
When you're ready to discuss this
as an adult, then we will talk.

168
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,759
Do l sense a bit of tension between
you and dear old Mother Crane?

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,355
l don't want to blow this
out of proportion.

170
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,149
Doesn't every woman feel
their mother-in-law-to-be

171
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,438
is an evil, dark-hearted,
psychotic murderess?

172
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,991
- l mean competitor.
- What exactly did she say?

173
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,879
l don't remember it word for word.
Something about,

174
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,474
''l have a gun
and l know how to use it.''

175
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,509
Before she left, she said l needed a
night on the town like a hole in the head.

176
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,316
That's kinda cute.

177
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,831
You think a death threat is cute?

178
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,798
Not as a rule, no. But...

179
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,270
...your sense of humour
is not exactly your strong point.

180
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,750
ls it possible
that this lady is joking with you?

181
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,708
Anything is possible,
but what's funny about...

182
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,872
...a hole in the head?

183
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,077
God...

184
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,879
ls it possible?

185
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,396
l feel so foolish.
She must think l'm a twit.

186
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,519
Don't worry, when l first met you,
l thought you were a twit, too.

187
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,239
Boy, this gal is a real kidder.

188
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,790
l mean, we're talking veritable goose.

189
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,951
We're having lunch together,

190
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,910
so l can show Hester
that l can give as good as l get.

191
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,156
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

192
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,118
- What's up?
- Everything that's supposed to be.

193
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,038
Norm,
l hear you spent the night in hospital.

194
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,078
- l'm OK, though.
- Good.

195
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,631
You can just take care of this
at your leisure, l suppose.

196
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,229
$683?

197
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,836
- To have your head checked?
- lsn't that something?

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,390
They did a whole battery of tests on me.

199
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,511
- The important thing is l'm OK, isn't it?
- Well, no. l mean, yes, but $683!

200
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,753
The cost of diagnostic testing
has gone up dramatically.

201
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,992
l read recently
it's running to billions every year.

202
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,631
Gee, l didn't know so many people
got hit by corks.

203
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,794
- What did they do to you down there?
- Mostly routine stuff.

204
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,157
l did take care of one other little matter.

205
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,993
- Like what?
- l had a little mole removed.

206
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,439
- And you stuck me with it?
- Norm, where did you have a mole?

207
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,273
That must have been the one
on your butt there, right?

208
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,230
Norm, l didn't know you were that...vain.

209
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,709
Who's ever going to see your rear end?

210
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,269
You're just about to, wise guy.

211
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,634
l think you took advantage of me, Norm.

212
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
l figured you'd want to throw in the mole.

213
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,399
Makes a nice birthday gift, you know.

214
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,949
You want to be hard-nosed,
l'll pay for it.

215
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,792
No, no.

216
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,428
Happy birthday.

217
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,990
- Thank you, it's just what l wanted.
- You're welcome.

218
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,358
l know it's a little early, but l wouldn't
say no to a tummy tuck for Christmas.

219
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,598
l'll think about it.
Diane, look who's here.

220
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,639
lf you have knees,
prepare to slap them now.

221
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,279
Hello, dear.

222
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,318
- You're feeling better?
- Much better.

223
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,393
lf Sam will let us steal you away,
l have reservations for three for lunch.

224
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,516
Sounds good.

225
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,754
Hester, l've been thinking a lot
about our little talk last night.

226
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,832
l hope you've been thinking
long and hard.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,672
l have.

228
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,877
Frasier, l came to a decision last night.

229
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,353
lf we marry, l think we should commit
mommy dearest to a rest home,

230
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,718
making sure that beating and starving
are the only forms of recreation.

231
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,029
Diane!

232
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,316
l beg your pardon?

233
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,438
ln fact, l feel like slapping
your face right now.

234
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,670
Take me out of here this moment.

235
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,038
lt's a joke, come on.
l'm obviously kidding.

236
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,795
We won't put her in a rest home,
we'll have her with us always.

237
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,793
We're going to have her stuffed.

238
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,196
And l'll even slit her throat
in the process. Thank you, Sam.

239
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,430
l've never encountered such hostility,
personally or professionally. l'm leaving.

240
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,831
No, just a minute, let's all take a beat.

241
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,873
The three of us
are going into Sam's office

242
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,429
and we'll work this thing through.

243
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,469
There's got to be a logical explanation.
And there'd better be, Diane.

244
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,679
lt's all a joke. Hester,
you're with me on this, aren't you?

245
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,551
lf terrible threats constitute jokes,
no, l'm not with you on this.

246
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,074
OK, time to take stock here.
l'm not crazy, right, Diane?

247
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,390
Right you are.

248
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,990
A whole year of my life.

249
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,598
Hester, l was trying to joke with you
like you were joking with me.

250
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,718
lf you weren't joking,
you threatened my life...

251
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,791
- l what?
- What?

252
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,909
She said that if l didn't stop seeing you,
she'd shoot me.

253
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,876
This was obviously a mistake.

254
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,113
You know perfectly well
you threatened my life!

255
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,919
l will not stay and be talked to like this.

256
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,755
Frasier, she is a rude,
boorish, spiteful woman,

257
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,471
who, for some reason
l don't understand, resents me terribly.

258
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,553
- Mother, please.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.

259
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,838
- Diane!
- l'm not lying. She is.

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,470
lf you love me, you'll stand up for me
now when l need it.

261
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,519
Frasier, l'm asking you
to leave with me now.

262
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,870
Frasier, this is the most important
moment in our relationship.

263
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,600
lf you abandon me now, that's it.

264
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,555
Mother, why did you threaten Diane?

265
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,152
- You believe her?
- Yes.

266
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,479
Oh, God!

267
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,389
l've lost you.

268
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,314
Frasier, l did say those terrible things,
but, believe me, l had good reason.

269
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,835
OK, she said them,
but she had good reasons.

270
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,117
- Not good enough!
- They'd better be good!

271
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,033
The best in the world.

272
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,752
l wanted to save you from ruining
what could be a brilliant career.

273
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,910
l just can't stand the picture
of you being married

274
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,073
to a pseudo-intellectual barmaid.

275
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,152
No offence intended.

276
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,436
None taken. Ç <i>ne fit rien.</i>

277
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,876
Mother, l can't believe this of you,

278
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,875
a woman who has always been the most
gentle, rational human being l've known.

279
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,034
My dear boy, you know l would never
follow through on my threat to kill her.

280
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,629
As l was pricing revolvers this morning,

281
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,588
l realised how irrational
my feelings were.

282
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,274
But don't you understand?

283
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,231
l'd rather see you shovelling sherbet
at Howard Johnson's

284
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,996
in a silly hat and an apron
than make a bad marriage.

285
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,913
Mother, you don't understand.

286
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,710
We're not going to have a bad marriage.
And l'm not going to shovel sherbet.

287
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,829
But l would be happy doing it
if Diane were at my side.

288
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,473
Oh, Frasier,

289
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,316
l never realised how much
this woman meant to you.

290
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,436
Of course,
l don't really understand why.

291
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,792
l never understood your spider collection
either, but l grew to accept that.

292
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,796
Diane, she's reaching out. Please.

293
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,118
Doctor Crane, l'm sorry
if l made a bad first impression,

294
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,877
but l think, no, l know,
it was a wrong impression.

295
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,909
l may be a diamond in the rough now,
but l'm a dreamer,

296
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,637
and l have a habit
of making dreams come true.

297
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,031
When and if l marry Frasier Crane,

298
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,716
l will be the kind of wife and family
you'll be proud to know and claim.

299
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,909
People will get tired hearing
you boast about your daughter-in-law.

300
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,435
Diane, l see l've handled this so badly.

301
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,351
Well, yes...l suppose
l've made a few mistakes myself.

302
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,158
- Let's go out and come in again.
- l'd love to.

303
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,158
This is the most incredible moment
of my entire day.

304
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,678
l'm going to take you two future best pals
out to the finest lunch in town.

305
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,832
- Sounds good
- OK.

306
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,948
l need a glass of water.

307
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,954
You two, go ahead, l'll catch up with you.

308
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,710
That's OK. lt's free of charge.

309
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,190
l understand you used to date
that woman.

310
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,638
l want to know how much you'd charge
to start things up again.

311
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,353
- You don't have enough money.
- How would you know?

312
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,479
There isn't enough money.

313
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,837
- l know what you mean.
- l don't think you do.

314
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,911
- l think l do.
- Oh, no.

315
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,275
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.

316
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,555
