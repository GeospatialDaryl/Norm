1
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:07,068
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:10,627
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.

3
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,866
Oh, come on, what kind
of a greeting is that?

4
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:18,738
When Norm comes in, you all yell,
"Norm," make a big fuss over him.

5
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:22,139
ls it asking too much for me to get
the same treatment once in a while?

6
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:25,977
- She's right. Try it again, sweetheart.
- Yeah. Thanks.

7
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,823
- Hello, everyone.
- Norm!

8
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,583
That's better.

9
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,663
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

10
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:54,702
- How's life, Mr Peterson?
- l'm waiting for the movie.

11
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,427
Normie, you're in early tonight.

12
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:59,148
Yeah, l wanted to talk to you guys
before this evening.

13
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,262
What's this evening?

14
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:04,226
Well, l'm meeting a prospective
client and his wife here.

15
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:07,738
He runs a huge dairy. He's looking for
someone to take care of his books.

16
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:12,777
All right. He wants to squeeze a little
bit more out of his taxes there, huh?

17
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,984
That's a very funny joke, Mr Clavin.

18
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:17,497
- You got any udders?
- "Udders."

19
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:21,820
All right, guys. This is exactly
the kind of sparkling wit

20
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,058
that l'm talking about, okay?

21
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,378
Now, it's really important
that l impress these people,

22
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:29,585
so l'd appreciate it if you'd kind of
leave me alone with the Brubakers.

23
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,666
Yeah, yeah. Listen to the man, fellas.

24
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:35,224
Don't worry, Normie,
l'll keep them away from us.

25
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:40,299
All right, Cliff, that last comment was
specifically addressed to you, okay?

26
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:42,827
What are you saying, Norm?

27
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:45,582
What, you're ashamed of your
best friend, huh?

28
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,865
Afraid l'm gonna embarrass you?
Afraid l'm gonna be a big bore?

29
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,865
Thanks for understanding, Cliff.

30
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:54,418
All right. All right, Norm,
my lips are sealed.

31
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:59,946
l'm mute. You won't hear another word
out of me on any subject.

32
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:01,700
How did you do it?

33
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:05,786
Sam, l'm going to have to take
a couple hours off this evening.

34
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:09,623
Wait a minute. Our absentee
waitress strikes again?

35
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:11,619
What is it this time, bleach-bag?

36
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,707
Hey, hey. Carla, do you mind?
l'm the employer here.

37
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:18,099
l'll handle this.
What is it this time, bleach-bag?

38
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:24,096
l volunteered to work the first two-hour
shift on an auction for public television.

39
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,776
- You'll be on TV? No kidding, huh?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:30,424
They're selling off celebrity belongings
from the Boston area.

41
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:35,264
We have a baton that Leinsdorf used,
a letter from Henry Cabot Lodge--

42
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,625
- And nothing from Sam Malone?
- Come on.

43
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:40,102
Not such a crazy idea.

44
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:46,582
As a matter of fact, some fellows
named Yastrzemski, Bobby Orr,

45
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:50,463
- something like Havlicek...
- Yeah.

46
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:53,944
...have donated their athletic
accoutrements.

47
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,218
Would you be interested, Sam?

48
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:59,265
Come on. l mean,
l was a good athlete,

49
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,862
but, l mean, those guys
are superstars.

50
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:04,184
Well, to some of us,
you are too, Sammy.

51
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:06,908
Yeah, Sam, you may not have been
out there as long as those guys,

52
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:08,706
but you were loved.

53
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,984
- Please. Please.
- Go ahead. Don't be embarrassed.

54
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:14,464
No, no. l mean, please, a little louder.
The rest of the bar didn't hear.

55
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,543
- Then you'll do it?
- Yeah, if it's for a worthy cause,

56
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,778
l guess l could give them
my old jersey.

57
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,940
You know, old number 1 6.
Yeah, l'm gonna do it.

58
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,383
l'll make a call, and--
You know, l'll tell you what.

59
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:29,097
lf this sells, maybe l could give them
some more of my athletic equipment.

60
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:33,819
While you're at it, Sam, why don't you
give them one of your old jockstraps.

61
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,382
No. Too many memories.

62
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:45,736
Now, come on, all you baseball
fans out there. Our celebrities--

63
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:47,500
Hey, Sam, have they sold
your jersey yet?

64
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:50,819
Are you kidding? lt's been on sale
for half an hour.

65
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,258
Sam's fans are probably clogging
the switchboard.

66
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:55,658
Come on, Carla, let's not
get carried away here.

67
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,426
- Mr Brubaker?
- Peterson?

68
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,260
Yes, Norm Peterson. Yes. Hi.

69
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,259
- This must be the lovely wife.
- Yes.

70
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,339
How do you do, ma'am.

71
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,021
Well, come on in, folks.

72
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,021
We have just a few moments
till our table's ready upstairs.

73
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:11,021
And we can just have a drink here
and get acquainted.

74
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,777
Just have a seat, folks.
This is Cheers.

75
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,736
l think you'll find it a friendly, warm,
pub-like atmosphere.

76
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,227
l hate bars.

77
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:22,181
Well, l think they should
be abolished, actually.

78
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,418
But we just have to be here
a few moments.

79
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:28,024
Then we can go on upstairs
and strap on the old feedbag.

80
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:32,506
- There are a lot of things l can't eat.
- Yes, we're both very careful.

81
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,337
Well, l have a very sensitive
stomach myself, so...

82
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:41,585
Good news. We just got in those taco-
flavoured pork rinds you love so much.

83
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:46,501
Friendly serving wench, you know.

84
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:49,137
Now, come on, all you
baseball fans out there.

85
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,379
l'm sure one ofyou wanna
make a bid on this

86
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:53,584
priceless piece ofbaseball
memorabilia

87
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:57,582
donated by ex-Red Sox star
Sam Maloney.

88
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,780
- That's "Malone."
- Oh, yes. Thank you for that.

89
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,707
Perhaps we should meet
some of our volunteers now.

90
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,656
- And what is your name, miss?
- Diane Chambers.

91
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:11,858
l wasjust giggling with one
of our callers over ajoke

92
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:15,259
- that l'd love to share with you, Bob.
- Well, please.

93
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:21,227
How many Surrealists does it take
to screw in a light bulb ?

94
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:25,345
- How many?
- The fish.

95
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,061
l guess Surrealistic humour
isn't your cup offur.

96
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:43,024
Mr Brubaker, would you tell me
a little bit about the dairy game?

97
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:45,224
l've always felt it must
be really fascinating.

98
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,181
Really? Why would you think that?

99
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:51,942
l...

100
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:55,423
Because of all the different products.

101
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:01,466
You have, you know, your milk,
cheese and...

102
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:06,905
Now, we still have yet to receive
a single offer for this

103
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:11,067
authentic old baseball shirt.

104
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:16,348
Double-stitched. A very nice garment,
even ifyou're not a baseball fan.

105
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:18,778
- l have a bid, Bob.
- You do? How much?

106
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,064
- A hundred dollars, Bob.
- Wonderful.

107
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:25,779
Well, there's a very generous offer.
Going once, twice, sold.

108
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,657
- Yeah!
- All right! Yeah.

109
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,625
That's not too bad.
A hundred big ones.

110
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:34,256
- Yeah, way to go, Sam.
- Mayday's back, huh?

111
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:38,222
l just feel good to be able to do
something to help out quality television.

112
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:40,982
l think maybe we should start
watching this station more often.

113
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:44,185
Well, enough of this pledge break.
Let's get back to our program.

114
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,704
Hydro-Mulching:
How Much? How Soon?

115
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,056
Okay, wrestling.

116
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,745
- Hi, Sam. l'm back.
- Hey, get in here.

117
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,899
So, what'd you think, huh?
Hundred bucks.

118
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:03,467
That's not too bad, is it?

119
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:07,743
Yes, the station asked me
to convey their appreciation

120
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,297
- to you for helping them out.
- Oh, well, l was glad to.

121
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:12,823
l mean, that's my favourite station.

122
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:14,262
- lt is?
- Yeah, yeah.

123
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,738
l especially like those two guys
that talk about the day's events.

124
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:22,938
- MacNeil, Lehrer?
- No, no. Bert and Ernie.

125
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:26,180
Oh, wait a minute. Unless...
Maybe that's their last names.

126
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,226
- Could be.
- Anyway, listen.

127
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:31,505
l was thinking maybe l should donate
a few more of my baseball treasures.

128
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,898
You know, like,
l got some hats in here.

129
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,786
- No.
- Sam. Sam.

130
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,582
- l really don't think that's necessary.
- Oh, hey, listen.

131
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:40,386
We got 1 00 bucks for my jersey.

132
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,665
We could be looking at a thou for
the whole Sam Malone package.

133
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:46,706
Let me just call these folks here.

134
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,745
l bought the jersey.

135
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:55,378
- You did?
- Yes, l did.

136
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,304
Well, l know you don't
like to sleep alone,

137
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:00,982
but why didn't you come to me?

138
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:07,346
l couldn't bear just seeing it sit there
and nobody bidding on it.

139
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:11,057
l felt sort of responsible,
and the station let me buy it.

140
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:14,739
Well, why'd you do that? l mean,
you barely gave it a chance, really.

141
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,779
What difference does it make?
lt's over.

142
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:20,418
The station has their money,
and you have your jersey back.

143
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,145
Well...

144
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:26,388
No, l want you to take that back.

145
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,458
Truth is, l haven't thought
about baseball in a long time.

146
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:34,223
Seeing that jersey up there
with all those great athletes' stuff

147
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,948
just, you know, kind of got
my juices going again.

148
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,537
Come on, take it back.
lt'll sell. l know it will.

149
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:42,308
- Come on.
- Okay, Sam. Sure.

150
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,026
- Maybe it will.
- Yeah.

151
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:48,625
- Maybe l responded prematurely.
- Thank you.

152
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:52,025
l'll leave it up there until it sells
or ends up on Mr. Bobo's table.

153
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:54,861
There you-- There you go.
That's the spirit.

154
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,745
Diane? Can l...?

155
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,705
- Yes, Sam.
- l'm sorry, whose table?

156
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,266
Mr. Bobo's table.

157
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:14,704
- What's that?
- That's where things are put

158
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,620
when they aren't sold.

159
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:20,378
- Well, then what happens?
- You don't wanna know.

160
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:23,301
Yes, l do. Tell me.

161
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:28,178
ln the last ten minutes of the telethon,
a chimpanzee, Mr. Bobo,

162
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:32,667
draws viewers' names
out of a coconut,

163
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:35,626
and they give the things away.

164
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,746
You mean that egghead
station of yours

165
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:41,980
lets some dumb animal choose
who gets the prizes?

166
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,663
That "dumb animal,"
as you called him,

167
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:48,582
was part of a language experiment
at Cornell University.

168
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,706
He has a vocabulary of 500 words.

169
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,380
Five-- Oh, come on, Diane,
l find that completely...

170
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,586
- l'd better hurry.
- Yeah, hurry.

171
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:05,343
Wait. Dubious! Yeah, dubious.

172
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,260
Volunteers are standing by
to take your calls.

173
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,420
Sam, l'm getting a little worried.
Nobody's made a bid on your jersey

174
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:13,307
- since they put it back on sale.
- lt's only been an hour.

175
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:15,146
They just gotta give it a chance,
that's all.

176
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:18,579
--keep this station alive.
Oh, and look who's here.

177
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:22,104
lt's Mr. Bobo. lsn't he impressive?

178
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:26,181
We'll be seeing more of Mr. Bobo
in the later stages of our auction.

179
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,106
Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Bobo.

180
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,107
You know, all of a sudden,
l don't think l can stick it out

181
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,496
and watch that old jersey sell.

182
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,818
l'm getting kind of sentimental.

183
00:11:34,988 --> 00:11:37,183
Just wish somebody would
buy the damn thing.

184
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,100
Oh, what are you worried about?

185
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:43,022
There are thousands of baseball fans
out there who remember Sam Malone

186
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,383
and who would kill to have
a souvenir of him.

187
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:49,139
Carla, from your lips to God's ears.
l think somebody's making a bid there.

188
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,697
Well, this is interesting.
We have a lady on the phone

189
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:56,988
who wants to buy old number 16
here for the sum of$200.

190
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:59,858
All right, huh?

191
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:03,145
That's just wonderful.
l'm going to tell Sam personally.

192
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:10,536
No, no. No check. l'll pay cash
and pick up the jersey later.

193
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,661
Damn.

194
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,307
- lt's all right. l don't blame you.
- Yeah.

195
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,777
After all, we both had the same fear,
that it wouldn't sell,

196
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,223
and you'd be humiliated.

197
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,426
Shamed.

198
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:35,707
- Disgraced in front of--
- Thank you. Thank you.

199
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:40,263
You know, they used to cheer
when l walked out of the bullpen.

200
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:44,467
l mean, just the sight of old
number 1 6 would start them off.

201
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:47,188
Now, see, those were great days.

202
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:51,620
Yes, they were. But you have
more great days ahead.

203
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:54,666
You have a real job now, and friends.

204
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:57,137
And you've got your health.

205
00:12:57,948 --> 00:12:59,700
God, that's low.

206
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,578
- What is?
- The health crack.

207
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,699
- Well, all l meant was--
- l know what you meant.

208
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,224
That was pity talking. You don't tell
somebody they still have their health

209
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,697
unless what you mean is
that's all they've got.

210
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,938
- Forget l said it.
- No, l'm not gonna forget it.

211
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:16,140
You told me l had good health.
l'm not gonna take that.

212
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:20,821
- Sam, you're sick.
- lt's too late to make up.

213
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,548
You know something?
You were pitying me,

214
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,347
and if there's one thing l can't
stand from you, it's pity.

215
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:30,421
You know, what the hell. l'm gonna
put that jersey back in the auction.

216
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:33,580
- And it's gonna sell.
- Well, l hope it does.

217
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:36,467
No, it's gonna sell because
l said it's gonna sell.

218
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:40,503
Thank you very much for reminding
me that l have a little self-respect left.

219
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,863
That l have some pride
in who l am. Hello?

220
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:45,861
l'd like to return that
young man's jersey.

221
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:49,506
And so the woodchuck says
to the lumberjack,

222
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,222
"l was talking to the log."

223
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:56,696
l never much cared for jokes
in which animals speak.

224
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:58,946
- Let's go.
- No, no. Neither do l.

225
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:03,181
l used that as a kind of awful joke
a mediocre accountant might use.

226
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:06,779
Can we have some coffee?
What do you say?

227
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,620
No, thank you. lt keeps me awake.

228
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,342
Well, l can see why you
wouldn't want that.

229
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,864
No, sir. Come on. We haven't
discussed business at all, sir.

230
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,906
l really think we ought to just have a
spot of something. What do you say?

231
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:21,060
- Well, l'd like a glass of water.
- Specialty of the house.

232
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,140
Come on, sit down. Sit down,
and l'll just run up to the bar

233
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,264
and get it myself.
lt'll be much quicker that way.

234
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:29,181
Just keep the old party going,
you know.

235
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,738
Cliff. Man, l'm in Death Valley
over here.

236
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,660
Help me out. Woody,
give me a glass of water.

237
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:38,298
Just help me out, will you? Just
come on over and just talk a little bit.

238
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:43,662
Who, me, Norm? The laughingstock,
windbag, the boob?

239
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:47,344
All right, l'm really sorry for whatever
l may have said this afternoon.

240
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:49,658
l just didn't know what these
people would be like.

241
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,420
Oh, yeah? What are they like, Norm?

242
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:53,146
They're like...

243
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:56,221
Like dead people without the rouge.

244
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:01,944
Sorry, Norm. Can't help you out.

245
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,860
All right, there's something
you should know.

246
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,067
Listen, l found out over dinner that
both their fathers were postmen.

247
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:12,258
Postal brats?

248
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,936
Normie, Normie, Normie,
you should have said so.

249
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:18,259
Stand aside, me bucko,
and l'll take care of the rest.

250
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,859
So your parents wore
the colours, huh?

251
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:27,579
Well, l didn't follow my father into
the service. And Henry's in milk.

252
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:30,700
Oh, well, that explains
the lovely complexion.

253
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:34,025
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, yeah, yours too.

254
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:37,667
So, you know, speaking of milk,
here's a little-known fact.

255
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:38,668
The cow was domesticated
by the Mesopotamians.

256
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:39,669
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, that's right.

257
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,670
In fact, it wasn't originally
a milk-bearing animal. Oh, no.

258
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:41,671
It was originally used as a guard animal
for the Chinese emperors

259
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:42,672
during the Chung King dynasty.

260
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:43,673
Just when you think
you know an animal.

261
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:44,674
Well, allow me to elucidate.

262
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:45,675
Thank you, Norm.
Get me a beer, will you?

263
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:46,676
Yeah. Theory was that the intruder
would step on a cowpie...

264
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:47,677
- How we doing?
- Great.

265
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:48,678
- They keep talking about your jersey.
- Really?

266
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,679
And still no bids for the jersey
time forgot.

267
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
- Donations can be made by check...
- I'd make a big donation

268
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:51,681
if I could go a couple of rounds
with that guy.

269
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:52,682
Sam, would you relax? I'm your
biggest fan, I'm not worried.

270
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:53,683
That jersey is gonna sell,
and for a wad.

271
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:54,684
- You think so?
- Absolutely. Money in the bank.

272
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:55,685
Just stop doubting yourself
and trust me.

273
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:56,686
You're right. What am I doing?

274
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:57,687
Woody, how much have we raised?

275
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:58,688
We got $116 and a pledge
for a quart of buttermilk.

276
00:15:58,689 --> 00:15:59,689
What are you do--?
What's going on?

277
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,690
Oh, Sam, we're just trying to help.

278
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:01,691
Well, I don't need your help.

279
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:02,692
Nobody goes near the telephone.
You hear me? Nobody.

280
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,693
Well, I think we're gonna
have to move on.

281
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:04,694
I'm afraid we're gonna have to take the
Malone jersey off the bidding table

282
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:05,695
to make room for this ingenious
potato-powered clock.

283
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:06,696
We'll be seeing more of the jersey
on Mr. Bobo's portion of the show.

284
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:07,697
One of the things folks love
about public television

285
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:08,698
- is the fact we show no commercials.
- Sam, I'm sorry.

286
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,699
That's okay. Well.

287
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
This is it, huh? The end of an era.

288
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,701
Well, maybe I can finally put my
career in perspective.

289
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:12,702
Enjoy it for what it was.

290
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:13,703
I was a small player in a big town.
But that's okay. That's okay. I had--

291
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:14,704
I had some laughs, some good times,
some bad times.

292
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,705
And now, I guess I'm no longer
Sam Malone, ex-baseball player.

293
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:16,706
I'm Sam Malone,
ex-ex-baseball player.

294
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:17,707
Just an average guy doing
an average job.

295
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,708
That's something I can be proud of.

296
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,709
Hold everything. We've had a $300
bid on Sam Malone's jersey.

297
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,710
All right! Oh, I own this burg!

298
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,711
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Sam...

299
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:22,712
Did any of you do it?

300
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:23,713
Come on, just admit it
if you did it. Please.

301
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:24,714
Honest, Sam. Nobody here bought it.

302
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:25,715
Hey, do you think we have enough
for that potato-powered clock?

303
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:26,716
They bought my jersey.
Three hundred bucks.

304
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:27,717
Sammy, I got a great idea.

305
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:28,718
Why don't you call, have that guy
who bought it come here.

306
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,719
- You could autograph it for him.
- You can take pictures,

307
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
- send them to the newspaper.
- That's a good idea.

308
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,721
It's a terrible idea. Sam, don't you see
what's happening?

309
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:32,722
- What?
- This is a last desperate grasp

310
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:33,723
- at glory that you just said was over.
- Oh, come on. Lighten up, will you?

311
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:34,724
Do you have to take the fun
out of everything?

312
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:35,725
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You do.

313
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:36,726
You're a delight, Clifford.

314
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:37,727
Oh, enchanté, Enid.

315
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:38,728
Drive carefully, huh?

316
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:39,729
What? What? Where are they going?
Where are they going?

317
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,730
Henry's gotta get up
early in the morning,

318
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:41,731
and Enid's sciatica's flaring up again.

319
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:42,732
Oh, what that woman endures.

320
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:43,733
Forget her, what about me?
Did I get the job?

321
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:44,734
Oh, jeez, Norm.
Norm, I forgot to ask.

322
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:45,735
Hey, look, don't worry.
I'll bring it up this weekend.

323
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:46,736
This weekend?

324
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:47,737
Yeah, they invited me up to the farm.

325
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:48,738
Forty-eight hours of Charades,
food and Yahtzee.

326
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:49,739
- Sam Malone?
-Yeah. Hey, everybody.

327
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
- I want you to meet a Mayday fan.
- I'm Bert Simpson.

328
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,741
Bert, hi. Sam Malone. Oh, Diane,
come on over here and meet Bert.

329
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:52,742
- Hello, Bert?
- How are you?

330
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:53,743
Well, this must be pretty thrilling
for you.

331
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:54,744
- Did you see me pitch at Fenway?
- No.

332
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:55,745
- Caught me on the tube then, huh?
- Not really.

333
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:56,746
Actually, I've never heard of you.

334
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:57,747
But to tell the truth, I wouldn't know
a baseball from a meatball.

335
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:58,748
Boy, catch me having spaghetti
at his house.

336
00:16:58,749 --> 00:16:59,749
Why don't you just let me sign
that thing for you,

337
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,750
and you can get the hell
out of here.

338
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:01,751
I have no interest in that.
I thought you might like it back.

339
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:02,752
Why did you buy it
if you didn't want it?

340
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:03,753
Oh, frankly, it was
getting on my nerves.

341
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:04,754
I mean, the thing kept coming back.

342
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:05,755
Finally I said to myself,
"It's for a worthy cause.

343
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:07,757
Put the damn thing
out of its misery."

344
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:08,758
Excuse me.
Can I see you in my office?

345
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,759
Gee, Sam, I'm awfully busy
right now.

346
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
No hurry. Whenever you have
a minute.

347
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:11,761
- Now, Sam--
- Relax, relax. What's the matter?

348
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:12,762
You're upset. You're humiliated.

349
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,763
And you're angry.

350
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:14,764
This shirt thing has been an emotional
roller coaster for you,

351
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:15,765
and you want someone on whom
to vent your frustration.

352
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:16,766
Come on, take a look at me.
Do I look upset? Do I look angry?

353
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:17,767
- Then why'd you drag me in here?
- Well, because I know

354
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:18,768
that you were just dying
to call me a big dope.

355
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:19,769
- No. Not me.
- Yeah.

356
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,770
I thought I'd give you a chance
to do it privately.

357
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,771
- I see what you're doing.
- What?

358
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:22,772
You want an excuse to blow up
and let it all out so you'll feel better.

359
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:23,773
And you want me to provide the
excuse. Well, I'm not falling for that.

360
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:24,774
I am not gonna blow up.

361
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:25,775
I just think that we're not gonna
be able to lay this thing to rest

362
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:26,776
until you call me a big dope.

363
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:27,777
It's what's in your mind,
so why not just say it.

364
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:28,778
Get it over with, and we'll go on
with our lives.

365
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:29,779
No.

366
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Well, I really wish you would. I think
it would be good for me to hear.

367
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:31,781
- Well, maybe you should--
- I knew it!

368
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:32,782
I knew it! I knew you couldn't keep
your big fat mouth shut.

369
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:33,783
Oh, God, you think you know
everything, don't you?

370
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,784
In your entire life, you've never said,
"I don't know," or, "I think this."

371
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:35,785
Or, "In my humble opinion."
Oh, no, you always just say this.

372
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:36,786
And you just say that. This, that!
This, that! You know, you're nuts.

373
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:37,787
You are crazy. And in your twisted
little mind, you probably think

374
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:38,788
you're gonna make me crazy
just like you made Frasier crazy,

375
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:39,789
just like you make everybody crazy.
But you won't make me crazy.

376
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,790
You wanna know why?
I'm gonna tell you why.

377
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,791
Are you listening? Here it comes.
I don't know!

378
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:42,792
I'll tell you something else.
You don't know either.

379
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:43,793
Nobody knows why you're
not gonna make me crazy.

380
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:44,794
So stick that in your hat
and smoke it.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
