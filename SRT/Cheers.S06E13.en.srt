00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,777
Then I loaned him               
my gloves.                      

125
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:03,778
            Yeah? What'd he say?

126
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:04,445
Thanks.                         

127
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,913
                Oh! Can't you   

128
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:08,098
just hear him?                  

129
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,484
     You know, the truth is     
      I know how you feel.      

130
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,819
      I felt the same way       
      about Haley Mills...      

131
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,821
when I was 12.                  

132
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,457
            When weren't you 12?

133
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,430
 Hello, ladies, can I help you? 

134
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:26,300
                We're here about
                the book club.  

135
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,685
        Oh, you probably        
        have us confused        

136
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:28,853
    with the public library.    

137
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,455
     Happens all the time.      
     It's two blocks down.      

138
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:32,289
This is Cheers, isn't it?       
                    SAM:        
                    Oh, yes.    

139
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:33,958
                     But there's
                     no way...  
  Excuse me. I'm Rebecca Howe.  

140
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,659
You must be Mrs. Miller.        
MRS. MILLER:                    
Yes.                            

141
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,344
    We're here to make          
     the final arrangements     

142
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,012
      for our Sunday night      
        meetings.               

143
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,282
         Great. Well, let me    
         show you the back room.

144
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,150
            I hope everything   
            suits your needs.   

145
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,986
 Yoo-hoo! Uh, Miss Howe, can I  
speak to you for a minute?      

146
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,588

147
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,856
            and I'll join you   
            in just a minute.   

148
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,826
What is... what is this         
about a-a book club?            

149
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,528
                Ever since I    
                arrived here,   

150
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,862
              I have been       
              desperately trying

151
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,631
          to upgrade the        
          clientele in this bar.

152
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,366
We will upgrade                 
some other night.               

153
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,903
Sunday is the night that we have
our weekly pool tournament.     

154
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:04,188
You said it.                    
That's right.                   

155
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:06,157
            Well, just have     
            your pool tournament
            another night.      

156
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:06,957

         ( <i>chuckling</i> )          

158
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,694
Like we can, uh, rearrange      
our schedule here. Right.       

159
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:11,728
                Well, what about
                Monday night?   

160
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:14,165
Yo, guys, we got a lady         
right off the boat here,

     Tell her what happens      
Monday night, will you, please?

164
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,704
              How about Tuesday?

165
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:21,705
          Darts Night.          

166

                      Wednesday?

    Well, recovery              
    from Darts Night.           

168
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:27,611
    Thursday's Poker Night.     

169
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,496
Friday's a night                
to howl.                        

170
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,349

    Saturday night              
    is Date Night,

    that leave us?              

172

         The book club will meet
         here on Sunday, period.

Oh, come...!                    

175
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,208
    We have a few questions.    

176
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,343
          Of course.

Say, excuse me.                 

177
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:43,477
I don't mean to be rude,        

178
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,696
     but, uh, do you ladies     
     comprise a book club?      

179
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,730
              Yes, that's right.

180
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,366
Well, the salon                 
of the '80s.                    

181
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,203
You know, it's encouraging      
to meet a group of adults       

182
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,370
who still read                  
in this day and age             

183
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,739
rather than pay homage          
to the great god, television.   

184
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:58,108
I can't tell you how            
heartened I am...               
                Excuse me.

              I have a cigarette
              going back there. 

186
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:05,349
        Of course.              
MAN:                            
Hey, Woody,                     

187
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,468
        when you were on the    
        set there, you see      
        any famous actresses?   

188
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:08,502
Huh?                            
            No.                 

189
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:09,686
 What about all the drug stuff  
            you hear            

190
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,155
    about in show business--    
        see any of that?        

191
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,822
              No.               

192
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:12,823
There's a lot of that

juicy backstabbing

              No.               

195

these stories.                  

196
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,580
        Yeah.

      you think you'll be,      

198
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,150
uh, through, uh, painting       
my apartment tomorrow, or what? 

199
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:24,318
            Yeah, I'll finish   
            up tomorrow.        

200
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,320
                 Can you have a,
                 uh, check ready
                 for me, Cliff? 

201
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:29,657

    give you one now.

                      Cliff, uh,

207
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:44,521
    you are going to pay me     
for this job, aren't you?       

208
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,674
  Hey, Normie, look, you, uh,   
  didn't charge me last year    

209
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,176
  when you painted Ma's house,  
            did you?            

210
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,010
        Well, that was before   
        I was a professional.   

211
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,946
 Oh, I'll say. We never did get 
     those windows unstuck.     

212

            NORM:               
            Cliff, I finished   
            half your place.    

213
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,401
        I'll be happy to        
        come by and finish      
        the rest of it, okay?   

214
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,936
    I'd appreciate a check.     
    If you've got a problem     

215
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,171
with that, why don't we work out
 a payment schedule right now?  

216
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,123
        Look, uh, Norm,         
    money is not a problem.     

217
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,092
You know that. It's just,       
 uh, well, I'm not a cheap man. 

218
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,812
Oh, a statement I'll wager      
     has never been uttered     

219
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:09,379
by anyone <i>but</i> a cheap man.      

220
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,732
 Look, Norm, if I knew you were 

221
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,266
going to charge me for all this,

222
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,802
      I would've demanded       
         a better job.          

223
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,837
         Now, I've been         
letting you slide, buddy.       

224
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,639
          If you think          
the work is so worthless,       

225
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,273
just finish it yourself, Cliff. 

226
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,825
        Well, uh,               
      not that I couldn't.      

227
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,161
I mean, it doesn't exactly take 
        a Phi Beta Kappa        

228
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:26,830
 to stick a brush in a bucket,  
  slap it on a wall, does it?   

229
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,633
    I mean, any monkey          
    can do that, huh?           
                    Oh, yeah,   

230
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,836
  as opposed to the high level  
of skill and precision it takes 

231

      to shove a postcard       
        through a slot.

     That's enough, enough,     
     okay, enough, Normie.

         Drinking beer together.

585
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:14,180
And I'm sure there's            
a lot of other stuff, too.      

586
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:15,381
                  Hey, you know,

587
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,000
you're partly at fault here.    

588
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,184
              You made fun      
              of his profession,

589
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:19,386
                 and you refused
                 to pay him.    

590
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,487
                And you, Norm...

591
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,389
Actually, you didn't            
do anything at                  
all, did you?                   

592
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:23,556
I'll tell you what.             

593
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,692
 Why don't you let me hold him, 
     and you biff him one?      

594
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,661
I don't know, Sammy.            

595
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:30,797
        I just want this        
        to be over with.        

596
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,365
            Yeah, me, too.      

597
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:34,534
        ( <i>sighs</i> )               
     Well, I'm sorry, Norm.     

598
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:37,003
    Just... make out a bill,    
        and I'll pay it.        

599
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,204
  I'll give you that discount.  

600
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,006
      All right, uh, I...       

601
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,742
 I guess that monkey stuff was  
 a little bit out of line, huh? 

602
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:44,694
     It was actually pretty     
funny, but... ( <i>chuckles</i> )      

603
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:47,581
It's a small man who can't laugh
at his own profession, you know?

604
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:50,683
                  Yeah.         
I just want to let bygones      
be bygones, all right?          

605
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:53,220
And the important               
thing is we're just...          
still friends, hmm?

00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,422
                 You mind, guys?

00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:56,756
Oh, oh, no, sorry, sorry.

Yeah, Normie, I'm, uh,          

611
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:08,602
I'm sort of sorry about         
everything that happened.       

612
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:10,337
                Oh, well, Cliff,
                I'm even sorrier

613
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,771
                for what's      
                about to happen.

614
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:13,039

You're dead meat, Peterson!

                  Let's go shoot
                  some stick.

          Hey, Woody.           

619
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,748
  Hey, Bob, how are you doing?  

620
00:22:54,782 --> 00:22:56,049
Fine. Look, I was               
just passing by,                

621
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,383
and I wanted                    
to return your gloves.          

622
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,152
Thanks for letting              
me use them.                    
              Hey, my pleasure. 

623
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,620
            Listen, could you   
            hang on a second?   
Sure.

             I got some friends

            You'll never        
            guess who's here.

                      Bob Urich.

            Woody, it's been    
            a horrible night.   

630
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,266
          I'm really not in     
          the mood to be teased.

631
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,034
    No, no, it's the truth.     
    He's really here.           

632
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:17,036
                 Woody, go away!

641
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,638
         and I'm having         
    a few people over.
