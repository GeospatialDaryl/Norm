1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,431
Goodnight, Dan.
Be careful going home now.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,556
Boy, that guy
sure chewed your ear off, Coach.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,558
Yeah, but what a nice guy.
You know something?

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,958
That's the first person l ever met
that was on the Titanic.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,231
- He survived the Titanic?
- l forgot to ask.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,635
l would've loved to hear that story.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,914
l figured you'd heard it. Big boat,
hit an iceberg. Bang! Down it went.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,880
Any interesting stories, call me.
lt's one of the joys of bartending.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,356
You want interesting?
Forget the Titanic. Come here.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,836
Glen, tell him
what you told me earlier. Go ahead.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,396
l know all the words
to the <i>Bonanza</i> theme song.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,433
Go ahead. Let him hear it.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,639
<i>We got a right</i>
<i>To pick a little fight</i>, <i>Bonanza!</i>

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,753
<i>lf anyone fights any one of us</i>
<i>He's gotta fight with me</i>

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,077
<i>We're not a one</i>
<i>To settle up and run</i>, <i>Bonanza!</i>

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,749
<i>Any one of us starts a little fight</i>
<i>Knows he can trust on me</i>

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,634
<i>One for four</i>, <i>four for one</i>,
<i>This we guarantee</i>

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,432
<i>One for four</i>, <i>four for one...</i>

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,230
- Howdy, sports fans.
- Norm!

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,238
- What'll it be, Norm?
- Fame, fortune, fast women.

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,078
Yeah? How about a beer?

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,475
Even better.

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,477
How's the search for work, Norm?

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,070
Good news, everybody.
l'm no longer looking for a job.

25
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,551
l'm now begging for one.

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,710
- l don't believe this.
- What now?

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,517
That was my mother. She just flew
into town and she's coming here.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,551
No kidding.
We finally get to meet her.

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,229
- This is very strange.
- That you have a mother?

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,873
No.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,037
That you have a mother
that wants to see you?

32
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,628
No. That she's coming over here.

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,911
l didn't think Mommy'd be caught dead
in a place like this.

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,429
What are we, too grungy or something?

35
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,632
Yeah, inside an hour ago,
l'm in the tub.

36
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,832
You're taking this too personally.
You shouldn't.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,431
- lt's just Mommy doesn't like bars.
- Bars can be very sad places.

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,233
Some people
spend their whole lives in a bar.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,239
Just yesterday, some guy sat
right here next to me for 1 1 hours.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,829
- What kind of a life is that?
- Pitiful.

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,032
The sad thing is,
he'll be sitting in a bar right now,

42
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,913
drinking a beer,
going on and on about nothing.

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,955
Diane, if your mom is anything
like you, everyone will love her.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,718
She's nothing like l am.

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,276
She's very eccentric
and a little hard to take at times.

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,789
Yeah, worlds apart.

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,632
Diane, if your mother's so rich,
how come you're not?

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,154
l didn't want to go through life
being handed money on a silver tray.

49
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,836
For you.

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,832
Thank you.

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,514
There she is. My little baby.

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,437
Mommy.

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,032
Hello, darling.

54
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,635
They didn't get near each other.
How can anyone miss Diane's mouth?

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,437
So, this is a bar.

56
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,435
Yes. This is where l work.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,038
Let me introduce you.
Mother, this is Sam,

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,517
who wouldn't say anything to
embarrass me, so wisely says nothing.

59
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,073
How do you do?

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,838
Hi.

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,431
This is Carla Tortelli. She says even
less than Sam and she's very busy.

62
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,438
Down there we have Norman
and his friend Cliff.

63
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,233
They lost their tongues in the war.

64
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,953
Ernie Pantusso.
You can call him Coach.

65
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,878
- Or use my other nickname, Red.
- Red?

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,673
As a player,
his team-mates called him Red.

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,916
Because your hair was red?

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,634
No, ma'am. Because l read a book.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,640
He's very sweet though. Very sweet.

70
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,513
lt's nice to finally meet you,
Mrs Chambers.

71
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,553
lt's nice to meet you, Sam.
Diane's told me about you.

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,434
You're almost as handsome
as she says you think you are.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,994
There's a compliment
in there someplace.

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,228
lt's very nice of you
to come all this way.

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,148
l thought so, too,
but you know what tomorrow is?

76
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,398
- No. What?
- Your wedding day. Congratulations.

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,229
My what?

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,749
lf you're not married
before tomorrow,

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,235
l lose my share
of your father's estate.

80
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,555
My God! Why?

81
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,832
Darling, when he died,
you were still a little gawky girl,

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,238
with your nose in a book
and a terrible facial tic.

83
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,032
Your father was worried
that you would never find a mate,

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,230
and that you would have
a lonely life.

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,831
So he made me promise
that l would have you married

86
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,430
ten years after the day he died.

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,993
He even put it in his will.

88
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,317
So, if you're still single,
l'm cut off.

89
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,516
Why have you waited to tell me?
Father's been dead ten years.

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,950
You know how time flies
when you're having...

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,836
- Grief.
- Grief.

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,833
So, if l'm not married by tomorrow,
you're broke?

93
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,349
Put your mind at ease.
l'll never be broke.

94
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,268
l'll either be rich or dead.
The choice is yours.

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,034
You're seriously asking me
to get married?

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,836
My attorneys have assured me
that it need be in name only,

97
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,269
just for a few days.
There's no other way.

98
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,035
This is the craziest thing
Father ever did.

99
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,230
Not even close, dear.

100
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,839
Excuse me, madam.
l dropped the bags off at the hotel.

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,235
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you, Boggs.

102
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,999
l'd be honoured
if you'd consent to be my wife.

103
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,640
l said ''in a pinch'', Boggs.

104
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,638
- Now wait over there.
- Yes, madam.

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,237
Darling, think hard.
There's so little time.

106
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,148
Don't you know anyone who'd be
willing to marry you for a few days?

107
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,592
Well, l'm afraid there's no one
l'm steadily dating at the moment.

108
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,153
Excuse me,...

109
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,236
..rich lady.

110
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,799
l couldn't help overhearing
your problems.

111
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,434
Your daughter has a hot thing
for the bartender.

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,994
l do not!

113
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,836
She likes Red?

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,955
He's dumb enough to be your father.

115
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,279
Not him. Sam.

116
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,153
l care nothing. l feel nothing.

117
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,032
Sam who?

118
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,436
Come off it. We've all noticed
how you two go around,

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,599
looking at each other
like lovesick cows. Admit it.

120
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,439
He's got you
steaming under the silks.

121
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,990
- This happens to be my mother.
- That's why l'm being delicate.

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,833
Diane, is this true?
How about the two of you?

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,632
l'd rather marry Boggs.

124
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,830
l could make you very happy.

125
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,910
Sorry, Boggs.
Just a figure of speech.

126
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,632
Thank you, miss.

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,515
Diane, he's not a bad-looking fellow.

128
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,430
His cologne's an affront to society
but what harm would it do to ask?

129
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,913
Mother, no.

130
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,230
Darling, please.

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,148
l wish l was as strong as you are,
but l'm not.

132
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,034
Without money,
l don't think l can make it.

133
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,399
Alright, l'll ask him. Sam?

134
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,194
- What?
- May l speak with you a moment?

135
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,956
- l might as well come to the point.
- That'd be nice.

136
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,957
Would you be willing to marry me?

137
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,836
Boy, this cologne
must be doing its stuff.

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,912
You see, my very eccentric father

139
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,636
put a very strange clause
into his will.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,550
Providing that if l'm not married
by tomorrow,

141
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,478
my mother will become destitute.

142
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,037
So, if we could get married, just
long enough to satisfy the attorneys,

143
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,312
it would really help her out
and l would consider it a favour.

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,989
l'd consider it a joke.
Marriage and me do not mix.

145
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,351
No, it's not marriage.
lt's a business arrangement.

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,029
Just for a couple of days
and then we'll get divorced.

147
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,152
Listen, l've been married before.
You haven't.

148
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,840
Take my word,
marriage changes people.

149
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,351
No woman in the world can hear those
words and not start believing it.

150
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,835
That's a very sexist thing to say.

151
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,475
No, it's not sexist
because no man can resist it either.

152
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,197
Why, Sam,
that's a very romantic thing to say.

153
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,632
The difference is, with men,
they get over it in an hour.

154
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,638
With women, it goes on for years.

155
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,357
lf you're worried about me,
l'm only doing this for my mother.

156
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,549
Yeah, right.

157
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,151
l promise you that l will not feel
any emotions toward you.

158
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,432
l learned a long time ago never to
trust anybody wearing a wedding gown,

159
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,152
especially a woman.

160
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,632
Forget l asked.

161
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,840
- l'm sorry.
- Never mind.

162
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,318
l'm sorry, Mommy. He said no.

163
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,431
Oh, dear.

164
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,273
Hell.

165
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,274
- OK, Diane.
- OK what?

166
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,799
OK, we'll... get married.

167
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,710
- Really?
- Yeah. You bet.

168
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,639
Mr Malone, how wonderful.

169
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,831
You're both wonderful.

170
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,632
Thank you very much.

171
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,555
l'm still rich. l'll get the Justice.

172
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,636
Come along, Boggs.

173
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,753
- Thanks for changing your mind.
- You're welcome. l wanted to help.

174
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,592
- What you're doing is very noble.
- Thank you.

175
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,793
Where do you want to go
on our honeymoon?

176
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,279
l should've known.

177
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,393
As usual, Mr Malone
has his brains caught in his zipper.

178
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,751
ls this the first wedding
in Cheers?

179
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,838
No, Frankie Flaherty
got married in this bar.

180
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,829
He met Janet in that corner, proposed
to her here, right in front of me,

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,157
they married there,
had their first fight by the piano,

182
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,796
she caught him in the poolroom with
a woman, shot him dead in the alley.

183
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,753
That's an incredible story.

184
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,077
- Want to know where he's buried?
- Where?

185
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,077
He ain't. He's cremated.

186
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,640
- Thank God!
- Here's his ashes.

187
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,078
- We've got the licence.
- What took you so long?

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,432
While l was there, l paid my
water bill and registered my bicycle.

189
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,790
Know what they ask
for a bicycle licence?

190
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,435
- Sam, shut up.
- Sorry, dear.

191
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,234
l'd like to introduce you
to Mr Harrison Fiedler,

192
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,238
Justice of the Peace,
who will perform the ceremony.

193
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,557
- Hi, Just.
- We need witnesses.

194
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,956
Yep. Every accident
needs some witnesses.

195
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,436
Sammy, please, l'd be proud
to be your best man.

196
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,152
l'm honoured. Thank you.

197
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,989
The day Diane walked in,
l knew you'd get together.

198
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,111
Coach, this is just temporary.

199
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,435
l knew that, too.

200
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,829
How come you never got married?

201
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,239
Well, Norm, Coach, it's unfair to ask
a woman to be the wife of a mailman.

202
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,236
Watching him get up every morning,
strapping on that mailbag,

203
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,831
hitting those mean streets, never
knowing if he's coming back or not.

204
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,234
Right. Somewhere out there
is a beagle with your name on it.

205
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,838
Excuse me. l think we should begin.

206
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,439
Are you ready, Mr Fiedler?

207
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,632
l'm ready. May l have the licence?

208
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,830
The groom's name is Schwinn?

209
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,636
That's my bicycle licence.

210
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,033
Excuse me.

211
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,311
Diane, do you think
we could we lose the aprons?

212
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,158
The aprons. Carla, the apron.

213
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,636
Gee, l didn't know
it was going to be this formal.

214
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,230
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

215
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,429
Just a business arrangement.
l do appreciate it for Mommy's sake.

216
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,836
You're welcome.
Just remember, no emotions.

217
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,237
lf l feel anything romantic,
l will run screaming from the room.

218
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,635
And l will clear a path for you.

219
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,636
Would the bride and groom
come forward, please?

220
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,631
We are gathered
in the presence of these witnesses

221
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,433
for the purpose
of uniting in matrimony

222
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Diane Chambers and Sam Malone.

223
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,038
The contract of marriage
is most solemn

224
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,628
and not to be entered into lightly,

225
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,151
but thoughtfully and seriously
and with a deep realisation

226
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,317
of its obligations
and responsibilities.

227
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,152
Any two people
who have come to this point

228
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,912
clearly feel the love and joy
that they find in one another

229
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,031
can surmount whatever obstacles
lie in their path.

230
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,711
Sam, do you take...?

231
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,038
Do you mind?

232
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,119
What?

233
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,555
Never mind. l'm sorry, please go on.

234
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,638
- Sam, do you take this woman...
- What did l do?

235
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,751
l saw the leer.

236
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,634
- Leer? Come on, Diane.
- Please.

237
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,637
Please go on.

238
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,877
Sam, do you take this woman
to be your lawful...?

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,437
She's a customer in my bar.
l smiled, that's all. Go on.

240
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,432
She's a woman.

241
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,760
Well, l'll be darned, so she is.

242
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,953
To have and to hold
from this time forward...

243
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,753
- lt was just a look.
- Just a look?

244
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,236
This is just a look.
This is what you did.

245
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,630
Can we get on with the ceremony?

246
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,433
- To have and to hold...
- Wait a minute.

247
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,235
What's the big deal? You're beginning
to sound like my wife.

248
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,590
Excuse me. We are getting married.

249
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,837
l may not be asking for 50 years
of love, honour and obey,

250
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,714
but it would be nice if, during
the ceremony, you didn't drool.

251
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,958
You really are demanding.

252
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,318
l don't understand why you're trying
to make me so crazy.

253
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,396
l don't understand
why you chose now

254
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,272
to demonstrate your lack of class.

255
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,789
l'm the one doing you the favour.

256
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,514
- Don't do me any favours.
- Children, please.

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,473
Butt out, Mom. This is
the stupidest thing l ever did.

258
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,751
Stupidest thing? There is
no stupidest thing you ever did.

259
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,871
Everything you do is equally stupid.

260
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,197
lncluding not throwing you out
when l saw your stupid face!

261
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,914
- Sam, do you have the ring?
- Shut up!

262
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,758
That's it. We're making a mockery
of marriage and it's all my fault.

263
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,235
There'll be no wedding here today.

264
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,271
Fine.

265
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,234
- l hate your guts and l always will.
- That goes double for me.

266
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,033
l understand
they wrote their own vows.

267
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,756
You know, 30 minutes ago,
l was a wealthy woman.

268
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,237
- Now l can't pay for these drinks.
- Don't worry. The drinks are on me.

269
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,432
l don't want your charity
and l don't want your pity,

270
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,949
but l will take your money.

271
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,437
Well, if it hadn't been
for dear old Dad

272
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,154
and his strange clause in the will,

273
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,840
you would never
have been in this predicament.

274
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,155
You mustn't think ill of your father.

275
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,831
He was concerned. He loved you
very much. You know that, don't you?

276
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,949
- Yes, l guess l do.
- ln a strange way, he loved me, too.

277
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,231
Unfortunately,
he loved a good joke more.

278
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,158
Spencer, wherever you are tonight,

279
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,430
l hope you're frying.

280
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,636
You two are still here?

281
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,949
We'll lock up.

282
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,830
How are you getting home?

283
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,635
How are we getting home, Mommy?

284
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,433
Boggs is waiting outside to drive us.

285
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,352
l'm sorry about this afternoon.

286
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,635
l'm sorry, too.

287
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,069
l told you,
weddings do weird things to me.

288
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,239
l must admit,
l got a little swept away myself.

289
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,950
l think l owe you an apology, too,
Mrs Chambers. l'm sorry.

290
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,158
What l asked you to do was unfair.

291
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,036
Are you alright?

292
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,597
Actually, l...
l'm really quite afraid.

293
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,030
Afraid of what, Mommy?

294
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,435
l'm afraid of being poor.

295
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,755
l was poor before l met your father,

296
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,874
and it took me years to really forget
how being poor felt.

297
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,353
Excuse me, madam.
Could l have a word?

298
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,436
- What is it, Boggs?
- l heard of your tragedy.

299
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,949
l'd be honoured
if you'd consent to be my wife.

300
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,796
- lt's too late for that.
- No. l meant you, madam.

301
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,233
Why, Boggs, have you lost your mind?

302
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,035
l mean, l've only accepted
your familiarity over the years

303
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,232
because l was afraid
of class warfare.

304
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,309
l am aware of that.

305
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,149
However, in view of the developments
in the last half an hour,

306
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,796
our stations have, shall we say,
grown a little closer.

307
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,069
Now, then, Boggs...

308
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,953
Madam, it so happens,

309
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,356
l have a considerable
sum of money stashed away.

310
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,632
Really?

311
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,637
- Where did you get it, Boggs?
- From you and yours, madam.

312
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,117
l've been embezzling from your family
for close to a quarter of a century.

313
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,836
Why, Boggs, how clever of you.

314
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,838
Exactly how much
money do you have?

315
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,349
As l recall my Emily Post,

316
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,031
a lady does not ask her chauffeur how
much he stole from her dead husband.

317
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,629
Let us just say,
l am very comfortable.

318
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,269
Shall we go to dinner
and talk about the future?

319
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,833
<i>Bon app</i>é<i>tit.</i>

320
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,671
You know, Boggs, l must confess,

321
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,638
l've always found the back of
your head enormously attractive.

322
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,236
l sensed it, madam.

323
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,394
Would you do me a favour, madam?

324
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,637
- What's that?
- Would you drive?

325
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,392
Kinky.

326
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,835
