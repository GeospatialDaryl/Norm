00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:05,055
CARLA: Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,407
Hi, it's me.

3
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:25,909
Li-listen, I've, uh...

4
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,827
I've been thinking about you and...

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,164
Oh, what the hell.

6
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,550
Will you marry me?

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,921
Sam?

8
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:38,922
SAM: Well,

9
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,473
who else do you think it'd be?

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,842
Sam, if this is some kind of a joke...

11
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,344
SAM: No, I'm serious.

12
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,346
Will you marry me?

13
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,985
Oh!

14
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,987
Oh, my God.

15
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,490
I'm... I'm stunned.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,992
I mean, it's-it's not like

17
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,494
I never expected to hear this from you.

18
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,495
It's just that

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,115
one is...

20
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,667
...is never quite
prepared for the question.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,953
Oh, Sam, I'm touched. I...

22
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:11,254
(Diane laughs)

23
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:13,623
All... All at once, I...

24
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,625
I'm-I'm feeling giddiness,

25
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,627
fear, euphoria, relief.

26
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,013
I-I don't know what to say.

27
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,381
Oh, that's okay.

28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,632
I'm not listening anymore.

29
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,271
Sam,
I-I-I...

30
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,774
I can't answer you now.

31
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:33,276
Not like this.

32
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,278
Every woman

33
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:38,281
wants her proposal to be...

34
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,150
enchanting,

35
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,986
something she can remember
for the rest of her life.

36
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,871
Find something like that.

37
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,123
Keeping in mind I don't
care for sports arenas,

38
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,375
theme parks or miniature golf.

39
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,161
All right, young lady, you just prepare

40
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:53,913
to be swept off your
feet tomorrow night.

41
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,250
I already have been.

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,252
Bon soir, mon coeur.

43
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,639
R-Right, right.

44
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:18,154
Ugh.

45
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:20,156
I'll get another one.

46
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:25,111

Good afternoon, everybody.

62

ALL: Norm.

63
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,651
Hey, Mr. Peterson.

64
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,519
What's the story?

65
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,853
Boy meets beer.

66
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,854
Boy drinks beer.

67
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:45,358
Boy gets another beer.

68
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,359
Uh,

69
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,861
boy, have I got an
evening cooked up for us.

70
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,363
Yeah? thanks for thinking of me, Cliffy,

71
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,365
but, uh, I think I better
get home early today.

72
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,866
What?

73
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,868
Yeah, Vera's getting
home from Springfield,

74
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,370
and I thought a special elegant meal

75
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,872
would be the proper way to
welcome her home, you know.

76
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,873
How thoughtful, Norm.

77
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,874
Say, what's on the menu?

78
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,376
Yeah, whatever she
feels like whipping up

79
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:04,877
after a five-hour bus trip.

80
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,878
Oh.

81
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,879
SAM: Hey Woody,

82
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,381
didn't you say you'd been to this,

83
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,882
uh, Le Petit Orange Restaurant?

84
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,884
Yeah. CLIFF: Hey, Woody,

85
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,886
you been to that, uh, fancy joint, eh?

86
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,388
Yeah, a couple of times. Yeah?

87
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,390
Yeah, well, how was it?
Did they treat you well?

88
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,391
I didn't eat there.

89
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,893
I just went in to use the men's room.

90
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,396
Well, the-the restaurant
part-- did it look like a...

91
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,282
a nice romantic place to take a lady?

92
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:27,734
Well, who could tell, Sam?

93
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,735
It's real dark in there,

94
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,736
and they got this guy

95
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,237
running around playing a violin.

96
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,739
SAM: Oh, no.

97
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,041
I bet they got those
pictures of those guys

98
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,043
that are half men,
half horse, too, right?

99
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,411
I'm glad you said that, Sam.

100
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,414
I thought I was seeing things.

101
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,416
I've been racking my brains all day

102
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,417
trying to find a place

103
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,918
that's out of the ordinary

104
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,420
and classy for dinner tonight.

105
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,922
How about a nude barbecue?

106
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,926
No. It's kind of dangerous
with all those sparks.

107
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,428
Oh, right.

108
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,680
Uh, well, what's the
occasion there, Stretch?

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,432
Well, let's just...

110
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,934
Let's just say it's a special evening

111
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,437
for a special lady.

112
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,938
Ooh! Get out your scorecards, boys.

113
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,440
Sounds like Sammy's back in action.

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,441
Yeah! Yeah!

115
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,942
FRASIER: I, uh, take it this means

116
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,194
you've terminated

117
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,029
your relationship with
Councilor Eldridge.

118
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,031
Ooh, yeah, in-in the dumper.

119
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,532
CLIFF: Well, gentlemen,

120
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,534
in memory of the
Councilor, may I suggest

121
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,536
we lower our cocktail
napkins to half mast, huh?

122
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,923
Yes, let's not forget the
traditional 21-peanut salute.

123
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,091
Oh, no.

124
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,681
Sammy, another round for the back?

125
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah, but I want to know
who's the lucky lady tonight.

126
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,601
CLIFF: Yeah, come on, Sammy.

127
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,103
You'll-You'll find out soon enough.

128
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,604
Just come on, help me
think of a place here.

129
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,556
Well, all right, Sam, I-I got something

130
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,058
that might be just the ticket for you.

131
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,059
How about this?

132
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,561
A sailboat anchored offshore,

133
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,447
you know, chilled champagne,

134
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,364
candlelit dinner

135
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,233
underneath the stars, huh?

136
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,985
Worked great for Sean and Madonna.

137
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,907
Where do you hear all this stupid stuff?

138
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,409
Let's just say

139
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,911
inquiring minds want to know, huh.

140
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,081
A sailboat. That's a good idea.

141
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,467
Maybe I'll call and
see if I can rent one.

142
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,219
Hey, Sam,

143
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,088
I just remembered something
that might help you.

144
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,089
What's that?

145
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,590
Now my Uncle Wade was a master

146
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,093
at putting women in a romantic mood.

147
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,094
Well, what-what'd he do?

148
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,095
Gave 'em money.

149
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,596
Worked like a charm.

150
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,099
Uh, thank you, Woody,

151
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,600
but I'm looking for a place

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,103
to take someone, a-a
very special place.

153
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,104
As a matter of fact, come here.

154
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:29,605
Can you keep a secret?

155
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:32,992
Can I keep a secret?

156
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,994
You still don't know Carla leaves early

157
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,995
on your night off, do you?

158
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,499
Good, good.

159
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,000
Listen, I'm only telling you this

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,503
because I-I like you,
and I... and I trust you.

161
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,872
I'm thinking about proposing.

162
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,792
Oh, well, Sam, I'm flattered, but...

163
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,298
You probably don't mean me, huh?

164
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,183
We'll talk later.

165
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,471
Boy, oh, boy, I wouldn't
mind being a barnacle

166
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:04,357
on the rudder of Sam's sailboat,
if you know what I mean.

167
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,142
I'm sure you'd be better-looking,

168
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,143
but would you be happier?

169
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,979
Ooh.

170
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,481
NORM: Woody, are you in pain, buddy?

171
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,982
No, I was just thinking.

172
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:15,485
Yeah, well, the first
time's always the worst.

173
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,208
Who do you think Sam's
gonna propose to tonight?

174
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,161
What're you babbling
about, Billy Bob Joe Jim?

175
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,662
Well, Sam said

176
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,165
he was gonna propose to someone.

177
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,666
FRASIER: That's odd.

178
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,668
He said he broke up
with Councilor Eldridge.

179
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,421
Who could he possibly be
talking about proposing to?

180
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,258
(Frasier and Carla scream)

181
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,763
You've chosen the most beautiful spot

182
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,765
in which to anchor.

183
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,268
Everything's absolutely perfect.

184
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,273
This is the most wonderful
idea any man ever came up with.

185
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,775
(chuckles)

186
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,777
Who came up with it?

187
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,278
Come on, give me some credit.

188
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,280
I have an original thought now and then.

189
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,282
You're right. I'm sorry.

190
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,667
Was it Frasier?

191
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,620
Actually, it was Cliff.

192
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,122
Well, okay then, don't tell me.

193
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,625
(giggles)

194
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,128
Right now I'm having a
rather unoriginal thought.

195
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,139
Are you as happy as I?

196
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,641
Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,643
I just wish I could get this song

198
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,644
out of my head.

199
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,145
Song?

200
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,032
Yeah. You-You know how

201
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:38,818
sometimes you connect certain places

202
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,320
and things with certain songs?

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,824
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.

204
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,825
Thank you.

205
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,326
This may sound a bit pretentious,

206
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,829
but every time I'm in a taxi,

207
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,333
I can't help but hum "Dove
Sono" from Le Nozze Di Figaro

208
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,837
simply because once a
rather zaftig Parisian cabbie

209
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,339
sang the entire aria on a trip

210
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,841
through Montparnasse to La Coupole.

211
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,226
(laughs)

212
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:06,512
Anyway, whenever I get
out on the water like this,

213
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,515
I can't help thinking about this tune.

214
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,519
Uh, Cappy Johnny, the old
sailor who taught me how to sail

215
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,022
used to whistle it all the time.

216
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,524
(whistles "Popeye the Sailor Man")

217
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,413
"Popeye the Sailor Man?"

218
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,699
You know it?

219
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,584
Oh, yes.

220
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:31,454
Well, that one haunts me, too.

221
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,339
May I propose a toast?

222
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,840
Indeed you may.

223
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,842
No, no, a, uh, shrimp toast.

224
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,345
A shrimp toast is even better.

225
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,713
Hmm.

226
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,049
To us.

227
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,051
How eloquent.

228
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,553
To us.

229
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,564
(laughs)

230
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,066
Boy, us.

231
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,567
(laughs) Mm.

232
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,069
What a pair, huh?

233
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:07,073
The important thing is that

234
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,575
this finally seems right.

235
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,576
Yeah.

236
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,078
I'm so happy about us.

237
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,581
I feel so good.

238
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,085
To think I almost let you
get away because of Janet.

239
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:24,090
Well, you had some crazy
notion you cared about her.

240
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,591
Well, hey, if it weren't for Janet,

241
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,594
I wouldn't be here right now.

242
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,981
Which reminds me, I guess I better...

243
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,850
better get to why I came
here in the first place.

244
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,854
Can you, uh, give me some room here?

245
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,357
Oh, oh, yes, indeed.

246
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:42,858
Mm. Ha, ha!

247
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,860
(laughs)

248
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,115
You know, for the longest time,

249
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,619
I kept pretending about you.

250
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:58,124
I guess I was afraid to
really admit my feelings.

251
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,126
But from the very start,

252
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,627
down deep inside,

253
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,013
I have been crazy about you.

254
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:04,880
Crazier about you

255
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,382
than any other woman I've ever met.

256
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,384
I mean, hell, I was crazy about you

257
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:09,385
even when I hated you.

258
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,388
(laughing)

259
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:18,277
What I'm trying to say is...

260
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,063
will you marry me?

261
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,066
No.

262
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,070
No?

263
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,323
No.

264
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,126
Are you serious?

265
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,127
I'm afraid I am.

266
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:46,138
Well...

267
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,142
seems to me you have two choices.

268
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,144
One, I can throw you in,

269
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,646
or two, you can jump in.

270
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,513
Sam, I warn you...

271
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,148
It's very simple.

272
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,817
One or two. Sam, you haven't...

273
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,653
It's not open for debate, Diane.

274
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,906
Sam, I think after you've
heard my explanation,

275
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,324
you won't...

276
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,336
Sam, throw me a line, please?!

277
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,338
Okay.

278
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,842
What's a nice girl like you
doing in an ocean like this?

279
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,845
Sam!

280
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,774
(dishes banging)

281
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:40,276
What are you doing?

282
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,777
SAM: The dishes!

283
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,280
(dishes banging)

284
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,782
Sam... calm down.

285
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:47,783
You're upset.

286
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,785
Only that I fished you out.

287
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,289
I know my answer was unexpected...

288
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,200
Unexpected. No, no.

289
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,200
Don't be silly.

290
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,292
I brought you out here
so I could be dumped

291
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,294
with a nautical theme.

292
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,295
(grunts)

293
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,798
(glass shattering)

294
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:04,800
(dishes banging)

295
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,804
Sam... if you'll stop
that for a moment...

296
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,306
if you'll stop that for a moment,

297
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,808
I'll try and explain... my answer.

298
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,311
Are you done?

299
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,813
Maybe.

300
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,317
All right, then.

301
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,821
As it happens, I came out
here with every intention

302
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:30,326
of... accepting your proposal...

303
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:33,329
but when you spoke of Janet, I...

304
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,333
had this enormous pang of doubt.

305
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:39,835
"What if wanting to get married

306
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,339
"is a knee-jerk reaction to losing her?

307
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,343
Does he want me or just someone?"

308
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,131
Oh, Sam, I want it so much,

309
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,135
but I have to be free of
doubt before I can say yes.

310
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,639
Sam?

311
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,981
Did you notice that?

312
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,484
Notice what?

313
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,488
Everything just got calm.

314
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,992
I don't notice any difference.

315
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:20,993
Oh, yes, yes.

316
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,495
There's a difference in everything.

317
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,998
The whole world just changed for me.

318
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,001
Oh!

319
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,002
Look!

320
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,005
The stars are new.

321
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,308
The moon is new.

322
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,729
Sam Malone is new, and I like him.

323
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:44,233
And I like them, and they like me.

324
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,735
And none of us like you.

325
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,241
Am I going overboard again?

326
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,743
No, no, no, don't be silly.

327
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:57,746
That would mean I care, and I don't.

328
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,248
Bye-bye, Diane.

329
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,249
Where are you going?

330
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,250
I'm going to swim ashore.

331
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,252
You can't do that.

332
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,255
Very well... I'll take the dinghy.

333
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,758
You... See how quickly
the new Sam adjusts?

334
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,763
You're going to just leave
me out here all alone?

335
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,682
Yes, I am.

336
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,686
Sam. Sam Malone.

337
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,187
If you leave me out here all alone,

338
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,190
you are the most despicable
creature on Earth!

339
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,695
Well, I yam what I yam,
and that's all what I yam.

340
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,947
(whistling "Popeye the Sailor Man")

341
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,874
Hello, Mr. Clavin.

342
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,377
Hey, Woodrow. Uh, suds du jour, please.

343
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,330
Oh, there he is!

344
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,832
Normie, eh!

345
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,217
So, uh, Vera get home from
Springfield last night, huh?

346
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,218
Yep. Yeah, yeah?

347
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,720
So, uh, how'd it go?

348
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,221
Well, I'll tell you, Cliff,

349
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,724
it got pretty hot in
our bedroom last night.

350
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,092
CLIFF: Whoo-hoo!

351
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,928
Yeah, yeah? Air conditioning broke down.

352
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,149
EVERYONE: Hey, hey!

353
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,434
The lucky fella.

354
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,935
Let me get this over with.

355
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,822
Uh, I asked her. She
said no. End of bulletin.

356
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,830
CARLA: Sorry, Sam.

357
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,699
I feel like dirt.

358
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm fine, everybody.

359
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,202
I just don't want to
talk about it, that's all.

360
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,204
Can I talk to you just for a minute?

361
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,708
Sure, Sam. What can I do you for?

362
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,711
Well...

363
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,214
I'm kind of worried
that Diane may get hurt.

364
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:42,134
My God, Sam, that is very noble of you.

365
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,635
No, I-I mean that I...

366
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,140
I had a dream last night
that I killed her...

367
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,144
and-and-and-and it
felt really good.

368
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,148
Does this mean I'm-I'm crazy or...?

369
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,150
No, no, of course not.

370
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,070
It's very normal for most sane people

371
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,572
to entertain insane impulses sometimes,

372
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,075
and it's very natural
to want to hurt someone

373
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,076
that's rejected you.

374
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,545
Well, for example...

375
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,330
Well, there's me.

376
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,666
But I can't tell you
how many times I felt

377
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,553
my own hands around her windpipe...

378
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,305
strangling her...

379
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,808
fingers tightening...

380
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,310
cartilage snapping!

381
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:30,516
And, uh, I'm a respected psychiatrist.

382
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:37,322
Look, Sam, you've been through
an emotional meat grinder.

383
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,775
My best advice to you is get away,

384
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:43,662
relax... reflect on what's happened.

385
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,998
You know, I still have the boat
rented for a couple of days.

386
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,001
I guess I could sail up to Marblehead.

387
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,003
Great. Cool it out there.

388
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,505
Thank you. You know, maybe
I'll work on the old tan.

389
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,008
Terrific. It'll be just
what the doctor ordered, Sam:

390
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,378
sun, salt air, ocean spray in your face.

391
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,680
I know I-I wish I could come with you.

392
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,549
Well, I wish I could ask.

393
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,299
I understand.

394
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:08,554
Ooh, boy, how 'bout that Diane, huh?

395
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,355
Eh, just like all women.

396
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,808
If they're not turnin' down
your proposal of marriage,

397
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,727
they're... they're accusin'
you of suspicious behavior

398
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,729
in the lingerie changin' room.

399
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,288
Oh, uh, hello, Diane.

400
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,790
Norman.

401
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,158
Excuse me, miss,

402
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:31,994
aren't you confusing
this bar with the one

403
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,496
where everyone isn't
repulsed by your presence?

404
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,885
Oh, Frasier, please
tell me where Sam is.

405
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,386
I have to talk with him.

406
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,390
Diane... in light of your
disposal of him last night,

407
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,393
I think it's better that
he be left alone right now.

408
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,395
That poor man.

409
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,397
Can you imagine how he must feel?

410
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,900
Gee, I'll try.

411
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,910
Of course. I'm sorry.

412
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,912
It's just that I'm so distraught.

413
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,914
I fear I've made a terrible mistake.

414
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,917
Sam's instincts were superior to my own.

415
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,418
He was right, and I was wrong.

416
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,786
I should've said yes.

417
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,255
You're running back to him?

418
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,006
If he'll have me. I...

419
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:23,846
Oh... my neck is so stiff
from that water last night.

420
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,348
Would you give me one
of your special massages?

421
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,350
Please? Please, please, please?

422
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,852
Certainly. Thank you.

423
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:36,859
I was such a fool out
in that boat last night.

424
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,360
(sighs)

425
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,361
When I told him no,

426
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,364
I was listening to my
head and not my heart.

427
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,366
I should've known.

428
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:48,370
Sam and I are inevitable.

429
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:52,374
Why fight it?

430
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,376
Why fight it?

431
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:58,380
Why fight it?

432
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,882
Frasier...

433
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,801
You don't mind me talking to you

434
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,300
about this, do you?

435
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,804
No, no, no, no.

436
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,306
Uh, I'm happy for you. Feels better.

437
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,807
Thank you. Good, good.

438
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,309
No, I'm-I'm really happy for you.

439
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,811
Uh, Diane, I think it's
wise to go to him now.

440
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,812
Yes. Uh, right-right now.

441
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,815
Yes, yes, right... Where is he?

442
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,317
Oh, uh...

443
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,819
(laughing): He, uh,
he, uh, took the boat

444
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,689
to Marblehead. Oh, thank you, Frasier.

445
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,943
I'll wait till tonight
and motor out to the boat.

446
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,444
Yes. Oh, this is perfect.

447
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,947
Sam will already be asleep,
and I'll slip into bed

448
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:34,449
beside him and give him
the surprise of his life.

449
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:35,367
Eh, uh, Diane?

450
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,252
Sam's nose is, uh, pushed

451
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,538
out of joint, and I think
you better let him cool down.

452
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,507
Oh, don't be silly. He proposed.

453
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,511
You can't turn off
emotions like a spigot.

454
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,513
Besides, making up has always been

455
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,016
the cornerstone of our relationship.

456
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,517
You know, that's...

457
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,970
that's what I always loved
about the two of you, Diane.

458
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,972
That's-that's beautiful, really.

459
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,724
You and Sam are magic.

460
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,059
I should've killed her
while I had the chance.

461
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,651
Hey, everybody.

462
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:11,653
Sam!

463
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,155
Thought you were on the high seas.

464
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,656
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

465
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:16,658
I decided the best way
to forget about Diane

466
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,161
was to start dating some babes

467
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:23,165
long on legs and short on syllables.

468
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,167
Sounds like a good plan, too.

469
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,169
Besides, I ran into
an old friend of mine,

470
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,171
Monsignor Demarest.

471
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:30,672
He needed to relax a little bit,

472
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,674
so I sent him out to
Marblehead on the boat.

473
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:34,676
Oh, my God!

474
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,178
What?

475
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,097
Nothing.

476
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,068
Nothing.

477
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,070
Oh.

478
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,941
(engine shuts off)

479
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,911
Thanks for the lift.

480
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,916
(engine starts)

481
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:13,348
(Diane and man screaming)

482
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,912
Yes!

483
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,631
Yes, what?

484
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:32,551
Yes, I will marry you.

485
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,554
Oh, oh, I see what's happening here.

486
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,556
You-you're still under the assumption

487
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,057
that that offer is still valid.

488
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,058
No, no, no, no.

489
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,061
The-the statute of limitations
on that proposal ran out

490
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,931
the second your feet hit the water.

491
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,235
In that case, may I
suggest you propose again?

492
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:54,606
I assure you this time, I
will accept your proposal.

493
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,909
Fine. I propose that you step
in front of a speeding bus.

494
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,078
(all laughing)

495
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,663
You know, and I...

496
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:04,499
from now on, I'm
dedicating myself to life,

497
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,001
liberty and the pursuit of every woman

498
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:08,003
in Boston except that one,

499
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,337
so, to celebrate,

500
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,289
drinks are on the house.
Come on, everybody!

501
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,792
(all cheering)

502
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,295
Wh-What do you think you're doing?

503
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm going to work.

504
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,183
I'll probably stop working
when we get married,

505
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:23,185
but I need a little
money for my trousseau.

506
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:26,438
Who knows when the first
little Malone will come along?

507
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,274
Yeah, how do I say this clearly
enough to register with you?

508
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,777
I'm buying everybody a drink
in this bar to seal the fact

509
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,780
that you and I are through forever.

510
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,282
Oh, come on, Sam, come on.

511
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,785
Nobody believes that.

512
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,788
Well, go ahead. Ask them.

513
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,623
Yeah, all right, I will.

514
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,458
Hey, turn around here
for a minute, guys.

515
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,326
Now, after everything I just said,

516
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,162
do you think that Diane and I

517
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,415
will ever get back together again?

518
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,253
Could I have my drink before I answer?
