1
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:06,482
LI'L SISTER DON'T CHA

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,946
Oh, no. Here comes another order.

3
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:20,204
I need two martinis.
One straight up, one over.

4
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:24,625
Gin or...vodka?

5
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:29,380
Gin. Beefeaters.

6
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,761
Anything eIse?

7
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,266
Yes. There's something eIse.

8
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:45,563
Something I need...desperateIy.

9
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,569
A MoIson GoIden aIe.

10
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,990
Sam, you're out of this room.

11
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:01,912
Coach, we were gonna kiss.

12
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,123
We were?

13
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,544
Do you mind if I do these first, Sam?

14
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,667
It won't budge.

15
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,838
I think I'II be pregnant
for the rest of my Iife.

16
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,257
Just Iike it said in the yearbook.

17
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:44,515
- Stubborn IittIe bugger, isn't he?
- He Iearnt about brothers and sisters.

18
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,102
He decided to stay inside
where it's safe.

19
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:54,358
There's a theory that Iate-born babies
are more inteIIigent. I was born Iate.

20
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:57,945
- Hey, so was I.
- It was just a theory.

21
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:02,866
- How did it happen the Iast time?
- Benny HiII did it.

22
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:08,122
- Benny HiII?
- I Iaughed so hard I went into Iabour.

23
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,457
I heard that couId happen.

24
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,628
If Iaughter's what you need, I have
a face that makes peopIe Iaugh.

25
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,548
But you got a nice personaIity, Diane.

26
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:24,680
No, I'm going to make a funny face.

27
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:34,314
I don't think it's gonna heIp,
but go ahead.

28
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,525
Very funny.

29
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:40,821
Let me have two Gansetts
for the IoveIy coupIe at the back.

30
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,449
- Have you got yourseIf covered yet?
- Yeah, it's aII set.

31
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:47,744
- My sister's gonna fiII in for me.
- Great. Thank you.

32
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:49,955
Which sister is this? No-Neck?

33
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:53,333
No, not No-Neck. Another one.

34
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,336
You have a sister named No-Neck?

35
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,757
It's her nickname.
Everyone in my famiIy has one.

36
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:04,761
Just out of curiosity, CarIa,
what's your nickname?

37
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,390
- Muffin.
- You're kidding?

38
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,767
What's wrong with Muffin?

39
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:16,189
It's just an incredibIe coincidence.
You and I have the same nickname.

40
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,150
No?

41
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:23,572
Daddy aIways caIIed me his muffin
because I was so sweet and toasty.

42
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:30,162
I'm Muffin cos my brothers put yeast
in my ears and tried to bake my face.

43
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:39,588
ShouId I ask what this sister's caIIed
or wiII I regret it?

44
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:44,176
Annette is different than the rest of us.
She's aIways been the good one.

45
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:47,512
- Every famiIy has its white sheep.
- You two cIose?

46
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:52,726
We never spent much time together.
I onIy see her at famiIy occasions.

47
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,145
Weddings, hoIidays, stays of execution.

48
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:59,900
Anyway, the thing about Annette,
she's reaI shy.

49
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,944
A waIIfIower.
She doesn't have many friends.

50
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,614
We'II take care of her.
When are we gonna meet her?

51
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:08,450
Soon. I've been in Iabour
for four minutes.

52
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:13,955
- It was my funny face, wasn't it?
- Why didn't you say something?

53
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,084
I tried to hoId out
untiI my customers Ieft.

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,628
It was my Iast shot at a pity tip.

55
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:23,507
MaiI it to me.
I'II be at Saint EIygius HospitaI.

56
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:27,427
Enjoy your drinks
whiIe I'm under the knife.

57
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,864
I'm CarIa's sister, Annette Lozupone.

58
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:51,952
What an interesting name.
How do you pronounce it?

59
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,293
- Lozupone.
- Gee, just Iike it sounds.

60
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,923
- Hi, Annette. I'm Sam.
- Hi.

61
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,510
We've been waiting for you.
I see you aIready met Coach.

62
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,305
He must be a good worker.

63
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,560
Let me introduce you around here.
That's CIiff, Annette.

64
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:20,564
This is Norm. This is Diane Chambers.

65
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,066
- Annette.
- Diane.

66
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:27,612
WeII, you must hear about me
from CarIa aII the time.

67
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:36,913
- She didn't mention another waitress?
- I've heard her taIk about Fishface.

68
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,791
She quit.

69
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:44,254
- Nice kid, that Annette.
- Yeah, she is, Coach.

70
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:48,091
- Yeah, she's cute too.
- Cute?

71
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,262
You Iike her there, CIiffo?

72
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:55,891
- I just said she was cute.
- Are you gonna ask her out?

73
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,601
No.

74
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,186
You haven't had a date in months.

75
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:05,817
There's an expIanation that you
riffraffs probabIy wouIdn't understand.

76
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:09,070
I have impossibIy high standards
for a woman.

77
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:11,281
She has to Iike you, right?

78
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:17,495
Excuse me. I'II get you a pad
and we'II get a tray.

79
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:20,665
- Here's a penciI.
- OK, Coach. Thanks.

80
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:29,382
You'd do her a favour if you asked
her out. She'd feeI more comfortabIe.

81
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,678
WeII, I don't know.
Maybe on the way out.

82
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,848
Gotta go.

83
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:40,518
So soon? The night's young
and it's your round.

84
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:45,732
Got a big day tomorrow. They've asked
me to test-drive a new postaI vehicIe.

85
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,403
- How come they asked you?
- I've got the best safety record.

86
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,616
- Never been near an accident.
- Not since you were born.

87
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:00,372
Was that comment addressed to me,
PauI?

88
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:06,336
No, CIiff. If it were addressed
to anybody, it'd get Iost in the maiI.

89
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,179
If I wasn't wearing this uniform,
I'd ask you to step outside.

90
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:20,266
If you weren't wearing it,
we'd aII step outside.

91
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:27,357
CIiff? Annette.

92
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,612
Excuse me. I just had
a sudden thought here.

93
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,200
If you're not doing anything,
maybe we couId go out if you want.

94
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,371
ReaIIy? That sounds nice.

95
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:48,878
WeII, I'd better warn you. I'm going on
a speciaI assignment for the department.

96
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:53,133
I've got no right
to ask you to wait for me.

97
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:58,888
Here's my phone number
in case you make it.

98
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:02,475
- Great. WeII, <i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
- Bye.

99
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:08,440
What do you think?
How's the new girI doing?

100
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:13,820
Very weII. That date with CIiff
is the second one she's made here.

101
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,156
ReaIIy?

102
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,076
WeII, that's good.
She's breaking out of her sheII.

103
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:24,122
Sam, it's Cheers. It's a romantic bar.

104
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:28,334
As many peopIe faII in Iove here
as get sick.

105
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,714
So what do you say? Maybe 1 am?

106
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,634
That wouId be fine.

107
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:48,730
- She's not what CarIa thinks she is.
- Yes, she is. She's just...

108
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,940
She's naive.

109
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:56,029
Sam, I am an exceIIent judge
of character.

110
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,157
And I say she's Ioose.

111
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:06,581
Stop. She's not Ioose. I'II taIk to her.
I'II keep her from getting into troubIe.

112
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:09,542
Annette, can I taIk to you in my office?

113
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:17,467
By the way, you'd do a Iot better if you
stop meddIing in other peopIe's sex Iives

114
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:20,136
and concentrated on mine.

115
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:30,438
That's great. That'II keep me
tiII the end of the minute.

116
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:40,365
- Did I do something wrong?
- I just wanted a IittIe taIk with you.

117
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:43,576
I know you haven't worked in bars
before

118
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,080
and I wanted to expIain
how men behave in bars.

119
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,250
They have a few drinks, get a IittIe high

120
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:55,421
and get carried away
around a beautifuI new waitress.

121
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,217
And, weII, does this make any sense
to you?

122
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:03,846
Why don't you we sit down here?
See, I thought maybe that...

123
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,642
Take me, take me!

124
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:14,440
Sam, teIephone caII.

125
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,860
I'II just teII them you're breaking in
a new waitress.

126
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,987
No! Coach!

127
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,661
OK, foIks. AImost ready.

128
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:37,834
That was CIiff. He's feeIing a Iot better.
He's coming in.

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,044
What happened to him anyway?

130
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,423
He was doing his test drive
a few days ago.

131
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:50,138
He stepped into a pothoIe, smashed his
Ieg, but he finished his route in pain.

132
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:55,768
He figured those 1 97 4 Christmas cards
couIdn't wait another day.

133
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:02,233
Annette? You're Iate again.

134
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,612
I'm sorry. WouId you Iike to take me
into your office and scoId me?

135
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:14,162
- Just maybe don't do it again.
- I won't.

136
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:22,503
She's turned into
the thing that devoured Boston.

137
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,299
- We've gotta teII CarIa.
- No, we do not.

138
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:29,844
It's none of our business
if she Iikes men.

139
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:34,432
Loves men. She can do whatever
she wants with her sex Iife.

140
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,642
It's in the BiII of Rights.

141
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:41,188
Where is it in the BiII of Rights?

142
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:46,277
WeII, you know, the part about
the right to assembIe and bear arms.

143
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:54,452
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

144
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:58,372
Hey. I thought you said
you weren't gonna caII me stupid

145
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:01,250
now that we're being intimate.

146
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:05,922
No. I said I wouIdn't caII you stupid
whiIe we're being intimate.

147
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,885
OK, foIks. The movie's ready.

148
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:13,596
- I got the Iights.
- Thanks, Sam.

149
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:18,768
Sit down. Get nice and comfy.
Here we go. Everyone comfortabIe?

150
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:25,024
This fiIm I caII ''A Trip To The HospitaI
To Visit CarIa

151
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:28,194
And Her New Two-Day-OId Baby.''

152
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,530
- I Iike it.
- Thanks, Sam.

153
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,826
Here we are in the eIevator.

154
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:40,831
Those eIevator doors are opening
and we go into CarIa's room.

155
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,751
And, yes, we go in...

156
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:48,005
And... Oh, gee, I made a mistake.
That's the dead guy's room.

157
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:52,802
The widow was so upset.
I tried to cheer her up with a gift.

158
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,680
It just wasn't the right moment.

159
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,684
Now, here we are.

160
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,940
I'm on the right fIoor, and there's CarIa's
room, I hope, and in we go.

161
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:10,069
It is! AII the kids were very good.

162
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:15,491
They were on their good behaviour.
Then Anthony squirted his water pistoI.

163
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,952
Here I am wiping the Iens.

164
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:23,416
And Seraphina grabbed the camera,
crawIed under a bed

165
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:27,169
and I begged her for it
and I had a heck of a time.

166
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:30,005
Then Ann Marie jumped on my back.

167
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:32,591
Coach, didn't you get
a shot of the baby?

168
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:35,845
- There she is.
- Which one's CarIa's?

169
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:40,724
It's the IittIe girI. Doesn't she Iook Iike
her mother? That's aII.

170
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:42,935
I got the Iights.

171
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:55,865
That was nice.
I'm gIad I got to see the babies.

172
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,701
You haven't been over there yet?

173
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:04,457
I got as far as the hospitaI,
but I met the surgeon in the parking Iot.

174
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:08,794
We spIit a six-pack in his van.
What a nice feIIow.

175
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,971
- Hey, Iook here!
- WeIcome back.

176
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:23,350
When CIiffy comes marching home
again... Come here.

177
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,561
WeIcome home, CIiffo.

178
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:29,857
Thank you, Coach.
Boy, I've missed you guys.

179
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,067
Except PauI.

180
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,904
- So, who wants to see it?
- No, not me.

181
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,658
I can't stand that stuff. I can't even eat
an open-faced sandwich.

182
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:44,455
It's aImost gone now anyway.

183
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:48,292
- A IittIe sudso there, CIiff.
- Thank you, Coach.

184
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,920
I had heaIing hands to heIp me.

185
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:56,634
- You deviI!
- Some incredibIe, beautifuI hands.

186
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,889
- He's been bitten by the Iove bug.
- You've found somebody?

187
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,142
- WeII...
- He did, he did.

188
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,771
I never thought I was the kind of guy
to faII head over heeIs.

189
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:11,482
Oh, God. It isn't Annette, is it?

190
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,235
- Yeah.
- I'm so happy for you.

191
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:19,573
Thank you, Diane. It's great.

192
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,286
She doesn't know it yet,
but I'm gonna ask for her hand.

193
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:28,749
- Annette?
- Isn't it something?

194
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:33,045
Me and CarIa's sweet IittIe sister.
It's Iike fate?

195
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:35,255
There she is.

196
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:42,721
- Hiya, sweetheart.
- HeIIo there, handsome.

197
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:53,232
Sam, I think we have to taIk
in the back room.

198
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,776
Why?

199
00:16:55,943 --> 00:17:02,157
It's our weekIy seminar on the use of
<i>leitmotiv</i> in the ''Chanson de RoIand''.

200
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:07,705
Yeah. Boy, time reaIIy fIies by,
doesn't it?

201
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:12,459
- Norman, join us. Coach?
- Not me, Diane. Thank you, no.

202
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,379
You're the guest speaker.

203
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,673
Hey, this might be good.

204
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:32,020
- We are confronted with a probIem.
- If we teII him, we ruin his Iife.

205
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:37,025
- What if we don't teII him?
- If we don't teII him, we ruin his Iife.

206
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:40,654
WeII, if I'm confused,
everybody must be.

207
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:49,413
CIiff's a sweet guy. If anyone
can change Annette, he's the one.

208
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,751
Maybe you're right.
I guess we've been pretty cynicaI.

209
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:59,631
Who are we to judge?
Maybe Annette reaIIy Ioves CIiff.

210
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:05,429
Face it. Love can be a rebirth
for any man and woman.

211
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:11,059
- I feeI better about that.
- Wasn't it Dante who said...

212
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:23,322
- Annette, wouId you get me a soda?
- CertainIy.

213
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:28,827
- CIiff is reaIIy something speciaI.
- Which one's CIiff?

214
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:35,667
Let me teII him. I'm his best friend.

215
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:39,713
- TaIk to you in the back room?
- Sure, Norm.

216
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:44,801
You sure?
This can destroy reIationships.

217
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:49,556
He shouId hear this from someone
who cares about him.

218
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:52,309
See you Iater, sweetheart.

219
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:59,274
- So what's going on, Norm?
- Nothing.

220
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,156
- I can't taIk to my buddy?
- Sure. No probIem.

221
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,331
So what's up?

222
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:18,543
What wouId you say your definition
of friendship was?

223
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,465
Annette's out there waiting for me.
Use a dictionary.

224
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:28,637
Friendship is two guys who remember
the good times they shared.

225
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:32,140
- That's good.
- Remember the times we shared?

226
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:36,395
- Listen. If you want a few bucks...
- No. CIiff...

227
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:41,149
Remember when you thought
that I was drinking too much?

228
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:47,781
And you feIt I reaIIy ought to stop.
As a friend, I appreciated that.

229
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:52,119
- You didn't stop.
- I decided you were wrong, but...

230
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:56,707
Remember when we took a squirt
on that guy's Iawn?

231
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,337
We kiIIed his Jack in a PuIpit.

232
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:11,138
What did you ask me back here for?
It wasn't to taIk over the good times.

233
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:14,057
WeII, not just that.

234
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:19,813
More Iike about...Annette.

235
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:27,612
Norm. Look. When Annette and
me are married, it won't change us.

236
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,451
CIiff, Annette's not as innocent
as you think she is.

237
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,873
What's that supposed to mean?

238
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,586
Since she's been working here,
she has been around.

239
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:45,756
And...around.

240
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,096
What are you saying this for?
Are you jeaIous?

241
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:58,560
Because we're starting a new Iife
and the magic's Ieft your reIationship?

242
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:03,732
More peopIe have enjoyed Annette's
magic than Doug Henning's.

243
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:11,448
Normie, I'II give you one second
to take that back.

244
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:16,912
OK, I'II give you three.

245
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:30,675
- Who's she been with?
- Everybody.

246
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:35,096
You?

247
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:38,475
Because you're married, right?

248
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:44,648
If you're married to a woman Iike Vera,
you don't even think of extramaritaI sex.

249
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:48,068
You try not to think about maritaI sex.

250
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,080
So you're gonna hate me now?

251
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,211
Hate her?

252
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:09,047
Hate yourseIf?

253
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:11,258
My choice too, yeah.

254
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:15,345
I guess I shouId have known.

255
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:21,268
She said she invented aII those things
it takes years to Iearn.

256
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:26,523
I guess I ought to thank you, Norm.

257
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,360
It couIdn't have been easy for you...

258
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:34,489
- I hope I do the same for you one day.
- Thanks.

259
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:43,081
- Come on. Let's get a beer.
- Are you kidding? The guys'II Iaugh.

260
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:45,292
No one wiII Iaugh at you.

261
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:49,337
They care about you
and know you're hurting.

262
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:53,550
Anybody who Iaughs at you
has gotta answer to me.

263
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,431
Normie, you're about the best friend
I ever had.

264
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:05,937
You're mine.

265
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:09,983
Wanna hug?

266
00:23:15,238 --> 00:23:17,198
Me neither.

267
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:22,620
It's not Iike you puIIed me
from a burning car wreck or anything.

268
00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:58,990
