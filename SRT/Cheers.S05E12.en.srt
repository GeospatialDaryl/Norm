(static hissing)

00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,794
NORM: Hey, wow, Sammy!

5
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:12,212
Woody, Woody, Woody, jump up there

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,213
and fix the TV. again, will you?

7
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,214
(patrons complaining)

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,219
Whoa, whoa!

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,220
Perfect, Perfect!

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,221
Don't move!

11
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,025
Oh, wait a second,
Woody-- uh, just a...

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,027
just a minor adjustment.

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
SAM: That's it!

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,035
Oh, I sure hope this game
doesn't go into overtime.

Oh, thank you.

32
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,395
Oh, dear.

33
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:53,897
What?

34
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:57,734
I can't remember whether
or not I left my stove on.

35
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,686
Oh, boy.

36
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,988
No, it's off.

37
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,823
A-ha. I think.

38
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,610
It's off. Of course it's off.

39
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,496
It's on. My apartment's on fire.

40
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:11,998
Still...

41
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:12,999
Go, go, go, go, go.

42
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,834
Oh, wait, uh, before you go,

43
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,836
uh, while you were
up there at Melville's

44
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,838
a Madame Likova called.

45
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,591
Something about showing up tonight

46
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,259
with, uh, a videotape and analysis?

47
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,512
Here? Madame Likova? Yeah.

48
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,347
Well, we've got to get
this place cleaned up.

49
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,598
Everyone, out!

50
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,218
What's the big deal? Who is she?

51
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,721
What?

52
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,222
Well, she...

53
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,727
Promise me, all of you, that
you won't make fun of me.

54
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,612
Yeah, right.

55
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,397
Hey... Carla, come on.

56
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,283
No, we, uh, we won't make
fun of you, we promise.

57
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,237
I've been studying ballet.

58
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,290
(laughing)

59
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,292
Sam!

60
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,161
You laughed.

61
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,914
No, no, we just, uh,
all thought of a joke.

62
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,800
What joke?

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,385
You in a tutu.

64
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,504
Come on. What is this?

65
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,506
Come on. Tell us all about it.

66
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:13,009
Madame Likova has been visiting Boston

67
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,762
and she consented to teach
a class at the college.

68
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,313
On a caprice,

69
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:19,599
I decided to enroll and I was accepted.

70
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,486
Our final session entailed doing
a solo performance on videotape.

71
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,405
Oh, I get it--
that way she could

72
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,156
puke in the privacy of her own home.

73
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,826
NORM: Diane, uh,

74
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,161
why the sudden interest in ballet?

75
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,447
Oh, Norman, it's not sudden.

76
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,450
I've had an on-again,
off-again love affair

77
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,337
with the ballet since
I was seven years old.

78
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,874
I studied for a while, then gave it up.

79
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,376
Regrettably, of course.

80
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:50,263
Although I was blessed
with a swan-like neck

81
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,965
and natural grace...

82
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:57,053
I abandoned my dream of
becoming a prima ballerina

83
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,440
and concentrated instead
on my career as a novelist.

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,860
Which explains why you're
here in a bar pushing beers.

85
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:11,651
Oh, I remember the first time
I ever put on my toe shoes...

86
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,653
Excuse me, Diane. Isn't
your apartment on fire?

87
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,154
Oh, my God!

88
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,906
I completely forgot!

89
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,291
My poor kitty.

90
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,792
Wait a minute.

91
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,295
I'm sure I turned it off.

92
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,797
(sizzling noise)

93
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,798
(coughing)

94
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,300
(meowing)

95
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,304
Hi, Cliff.

96
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,305
Hey, Diane. Hi, everybody.

97
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,806
Sammy? Hey!

98
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,676
Mind if I put one of these up
on the old, uh, bulletin board?

99
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,894
Go ahead.

100
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:40,680
Ah, better take this old
one of mine down, huh?

101
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,181
Boy, oh, boy, nobody was interested

102
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,184
in my singles potluck séance.

103
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,188
What's going up this time?

104
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,523
Well, you know, for years

105
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,525
I've been saving up
and, uh, finally made it.

106
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,411
I bought myself a snazzy
Italian sports car.

107
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,663
Yup.

108
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,164
As of tomorrow I'm going to be the owner

109
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,415
of a brand new Alfredo.

110
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,250
Hey, all right.

111
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,119
But first I got to, uh,

112
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,871
sell off the old Cliff-mobile.

113
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,205
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,459
Now you own a 1965 Chevy
station wagon, right?

115
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,626
Yes, sir.

116
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,428
This is a picture of a Rolls-Royce.

117
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:13,296
What are you doing?

118
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,099
Uh, read the copy there, Sammy.

119
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,435
"Chevy, the Rolls-Royce
of station wagons."

120
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:20,937
Oh, come on.

121
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,939
Smart.

122
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,442
Um, ex... excuse me.

123
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,443
SAM: Yeah?

124
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:30,196
I'm looking for Diane Chambers.

125
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,481
Oh, she's not here right now.

126
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,983
Oh, I'll bet you, you're
Madame Lik... Likova.

127
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,401
Oh! Oh, goodness no.

128
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,903
No.

129
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,706
How Madame would laugh
if she heard you say that.

130
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,375
And then she would strike me.

131
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,579
No, I, I am Leeza, her assistant.

132
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,580
Oh, Sam Malone, hi.

133
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,581
Hello. Hello.

134
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,582
Frasier Crane.

135
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,466
Hello.

136
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:51,417
Uh, well, is Madame

137
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,418
going to come here

138
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,920
later on tonight?

139
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,423
Oh, no, no, Madame Likova
would never come to a tavern.

140
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,175
No, I am bringing by

141
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,094
the tape and analysis for Diane.

142
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,097
Normally the students
pick them up themselves,

143
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:10,853
but, well, Madame Likova
can be very... harsh,

144
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,523
so I wanted to soften the blow

145
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,324
by bringing them here myself.

146
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,576
Her dancing's that bad, huh?

147
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,578
I am afraid so.

148
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:23,082
That is why I, I, I
wanted to come here myself

149
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,953
and, and tell her not to dance anymore.

150
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,206
Uh, but I, I have to go now.

151
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:32,208
Uh, we are checking out tonight.

152
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,210
And an impatient Madame Likova

153
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,711
is a dangerous Madame Likova.

154
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,463
Oh.

155
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:41,267
Uh, give her this
videotape and this envelope

156
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,770
and tell her I'm so sorry.

157
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,772
Well, I will. Thank you very much.

158
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,722
Yes, thank you.

159
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:47,723
Do Svidaniya.

160
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,692
"Do Svidaniya", huh?

161
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,195
Those Russkies can never leave

162
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,698
without slipping in
some Soviet propaganda.

163
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:57,700
Hey, you guys think, uh, Diane

164
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,569
is really that bad of a dancer?

165
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,487
CARLA: I don't know.

166
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,991
Guess there's no way of
ever knowing, is there?

167
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,994
Yeah, none that I can really think of.

168
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,912
CLIFF: Me, uh, neither.

169
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:11,297
And who knows if that VCR

170
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,665
in Sammy's office even works, you know?

171
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,635
There's, uh, there's only one way

172
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,136
to find out, you know. How's that?

173
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,005
Get a tape and, uh,
slip it right in there.

174
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,972
Talk about luck.

175
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,341
Here's a tape right here.

176
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,012
That's extremely insensitive.

177
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,013
No, it's not. No, it's not.

178
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,514
It's like driving by
the scene of an accident.

179
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,515
You don't want to look,

180
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,517
but you just can't help yourself.

181
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,521
Yeah, and in this case you get
to play it over and over again.

182
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,525
(piano playing)

183
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,910
Is it working?

184
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,661
(laughing)

185
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,662
Guess so.

186
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,664
Hey, that's Miss Chambers.

187
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,165
Oh, boy.

188
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,167
Why is she hopping around like that?

189
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,669
Well, she's dancing, Woody.

190
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,120
Get out!

191
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,424
I don't know, guys.

192
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:56,926
You know, maybe this isn't funny.

193
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,428
Sam, are you looking at the screen?

194
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,430
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm just...

195
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,433
(groaning, complaining)

196
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,435
Being laughed at is
going to be the least

197
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:07,436
of Diane's worries.

198
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:08,938
If she ever reads this analysis,

199
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:09,939
she's going to be shattered.

200
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,440
Take a look at this thing.

201
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,441
Oh, boy.

202
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,443
"Poor, poor,

203
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,395
poor, terrible..."

204
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,867
Ooh, how was her attendance?

205
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,368
What... I mean, what are we gonna do?

206
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,871
She thinks her teacher's
going to show up tonight.

207
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,372
Uh, what are we going to tell her?

208
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,741
We're not going to tell her anything.

209
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,076
Madame Likova is going

210
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,078
to write her a splendid analysis.

211
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,579
Can I borrow your office?

212
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,964
Oh, hey, now wait a second now.

213
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:36,916
Do you think this is
the right way to do it?

214
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,417
Oh, listen, what harm can it do?

215
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,919
I mean, she said this
was a one-shot deal.

216
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,671
Why not let her leave it a winner?

217
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,006
Uh, why would you, her favorite doormat,

218
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:47,009
want to make her feel
better about herself?

219
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,427
Oh, I hear what you're saying.

220
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,930
Yeah, sure, she mocked me, debased me,

221
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,433
humiliated me, ridiculed me,
finally left me at the altar,

222
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,937
but you never really can
forget your first love, can you?

223
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,330
Back again.

224
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,282
And you'll all be happy to know

225
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,283
that my oven was off.

226
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,284
Ah!

227
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,169
But I had left the milk out,

228
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,670
so it wasn't a wasted trip.

229
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,540
Uh, Diane,

230
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,209
while you were out,
your, uh, dance teacher's

231
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,510
assistant came by.

232
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,462
Oh, poo.

233
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,464
Madame Likova didn't come?

234
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,885
No, no, uh, she got hold
of a bad bowl of borscht.

235
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,387
Uh...

236
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:35,391
but she, she, uh, told us
to make sure you got this.

237
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,312
Here it is.

238
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,813
Yeah.

239
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,316
The moment of truth.

240
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,700
Mm...

241
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,371
Oh, I can't.

242
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:49,789
Oh, oh, come on.

243
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,041
You, you're going to
have to open it sometime.

244
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,332
"Technique: very good.

245
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,833
"Strength: very good.

246
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,336
"Emotional response: outstanding.

247
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,671
Flexibility: average"?

248
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,674
Well, I always thought
I was very flexible.

249
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,063
"Excellent natural instincts."

250
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,569
"Soul of a dancer."

251
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,407
"If not for the late start,

252
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,776
could have had a career in dance."

253
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,078
Oh, my.

254
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,363
Oh, I'd love to call her and thank her.

255
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,864
Maybe I can still
catch her at the hotel.

256
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,617
Oh, no, no, Diane, I don't
think that's a good idea at all.

257
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,285
Why not?

258
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:39,088
Why not...?

259
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,589
Why not?

260
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,509
Because, uh, because...

261
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,013
Well, uh, you know,
she's probably packing

262
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,514
and if you disturb her right now,

263
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,017
she'd probably put, uh, her,
her work clothes in one bag

264
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,019
and her regular stuff in another bag.

265
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,021
Then if the airline
lost one of those bags,

266
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,523
then she, you know,
either she wouldn't be able

267
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:01,027
to work or she'd look real
goofy out there on the street.

268
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,029
That's why not.

269
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,399
Is there something
you're not telling me?

270
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,200
No! Ha! No.

271
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,702
We're just, uh...

272
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,070
What are we doing here?

273
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,825
Uh, well, we're, ha,
we're horsing around.

274
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,209
Horsing around, huh?

275
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,078
(laughing)

276
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:19,962
FRASIER: No, listen.

277
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:20,913
The fact is we're all just

278
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,415
thrilled to death about the report.

279
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,917
Now you go ahead and call
her. I'm out of here, fellas.

280
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,921
Sit.

281
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,309
Ah, yes, Madame Likova, please.

282
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh, boy...

283
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,646
DIANE: Oh, I see.

284
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,814
She's busy, huh?

285
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,766
Well, maybe...

286
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,652
Oh, Madame Likova!

287
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,282
Madame Likova!

288
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,783
Yes, yes.

289
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,568
This is Diane Chambers.

290
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,538
I'm, I'm so glad I caught you.

291
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,541
I...

292
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,543
Yes. Yes, Madame Likova.

293
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,044
I read it. I...

294
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,913
Did you really mean everything you said?

295
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,749
Ah, yes, I'm sorry.

296
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:16,252
I know you always mean what you say.

297
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,253
(line disconnects, dial tone buzzes)

298
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,254
Hello?

299
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,675
She hung up.

300
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,679
Well, she was never one to chat.

301
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,431
This is unbelievable.

302
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:29,765
Mmm.

303
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:31,150
I never thought I was this good.

304
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,853
Maybe I've been too critical of myself.

305
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,605
I really don't think that's possible.

306
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,859
I must view my tape again--
through Madame's eyes.

307
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,278
Would any of you mind, if...?

308
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:43,279
Mind?

309
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,281
We'd be angry if you didn't.

310
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,785
Oh, my friends.

311
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:59,261
I'm, I'm so glad you're all here
to share this moment with me.

312
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,598
I tell you what.

313
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,099
What don't you come and stand

314
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,101
right up close to the television here?

315
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,102
Oh, okay.

316
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:09,104
So you get the best possible viewing,

317
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,606
and we'll just sort of surround you

318
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,108
behind you so we don't
distract you, all right?

319
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,109
CARLA: Hit it!

320
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,862
(piano playing)

321
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:22,151
Yes, yes. Look at me.

322
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:26,455
(muffled laughter)

323
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:31,577
Ever since I was a child,
I wanted to dance so badly.

324
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,913
Ooh, looks like you got your wish.

325
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,595
Norman, don't you think it's time

326
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,980
you got home to your beloved?

327
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,400
No, no, it's, uh, Vera's
night to howl tonight.

328
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,769
She's, uh, hosting a Tupperware party.

329
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,571
I'd say, uh,

330
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,072
right about now they're
probably knee-deep

331
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,440
in lettuce crispers.

332
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,778
Vera's really into Tupperware?

333
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,779
Are you kidding?

334
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,081
She wants to be buried
in one of those things.

335
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,918
I can just, uh, see the service.

336
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,920
You know, they lower
you into the ground,

337
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,921
somebody burps the corner

338
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,875
and you're sealed fresh
for eternity, I guess.

339
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:23,929
Oh...

340
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,100
Was that a sigh, Diane?

341
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,019
I don't know.

342
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,022
Come on. What's the matter? Come on.

343
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,391
Nothing. You mentioned eternity, and...

344
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,309
it got me to thinking.

345
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,815
"For of all the sad
words of tongue or pen,

346
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:47,319
The saddest are these:
It might have been."

347
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,455
Yeah.

348
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,294
I wonder what might have happened

349
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,795
if I had pursued my dream.

350
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,966
Who knows?

351
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,469
I might have ended up an
accomplished ballerina.

352
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:07,890
Now I'll never know.

353
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,843
Yeah, that is tough, but, uh, well,

354
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,345
that's what you get for dreaming.

355
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,850
Didn't you ever have a dream, Norman?

356
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,769
No.

357
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,022
Not at all? Nope.

358
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,990
You never wanted something
that was out of reach?

359
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,661
Well, uh... beer nuts.

360
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,669
Norman, I'm serious.

361
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,455
So am I. Could you just...

362
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,456
Yeah.

363
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,710
Everyone has dreams, Norman.

364
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,462
Everyone except me.

365
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:47,796
I learned

366
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:49,298
early in life not to have 'em.

367
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,182
Oh...

368
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,184
Yeah! I figure they're useless.

369
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,185
They don't come true anyway.

370
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,687
Norman...

371
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,188
Yeah, life's tough enough

372
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,190
without getting yourself all worked up

373
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,192
over something that's not gonna happen.

374
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,193
Mm-mm.

375
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,697
Dreams-- they just
give you heartache.

376
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,451
But isn't the real heartache

377
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:11,453
knowing that you had the
potential to do something

378
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,955
and you never tried?

379
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:14,790
Listen to me.

380
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,958
Listen to me!

381
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,078
Do I have another choice?

382
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,330
I have the potential to be a dancer.

383
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,833
I still have a fighting chance
to make my dream come true.

384
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,470
I'm gonna send my tape to Boston Ballet.

385
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,172
You know... In fact, I am

386
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,141
going to drop it in the mail tonight.

387
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,142
I, uh...

388
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,143
Oh, Norman...

389
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,144
Diane?

390
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:38,147
Oh, this is so wonderful. Well...

391
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:40,149
Thank you so much. (smooches)

392
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,150
Um...

393
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,068
I'm too excited to stick around.

394
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,570
Anyway, you know how to
lock up, right, Norman?

395
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,938
You kidding? I'm the one who taught you.

396
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,940
Right.

397
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,941
Good night.

398
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,442
Yeah.

399
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,446
Well.

400
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,949
Ah, alone in a bar.

401
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:03,956
Maybe Diane is right.

402
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,958
I guess dreams can come true.

403
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,969
Hello, everyone.

404
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:17,970
My!

405
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,725
Don't you look the ballerina.

406
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:23,726
Thank you, Carla.

407
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,729
Now, why don't you take a flying leap?

408
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,732
Sam, the reason I came early

409
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,735
was to tell you that I'm
going to be a little late.

410
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,737
You're not early. You're right on time.

411
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:37,740
Oh. Well, then, I'm
going to be quite late.

412
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,242
I'm auditioning for Boston Ballet.

413
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,627
Would you mind

414
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,995
if I warmed up?

415
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,998
This seems a tad high, but
it might serve as a barre.

416
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,501
Well, it is a bar, Miss Chambers.

417
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,004
No, Woody, when a dancer warms up,

418
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,389
they hold onto a barre.

419
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,092
That is a bar.

420
00:17:57,092 --> 00:18:00,012
FRASIER: If I might
interrupt here, uh...

421
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,013
Please.

422
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,899
Diane, what audition?

423
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,400
Well, you know I sent off my tape

424
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,401
to Boston Ballet.

425
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,020
Yeah. What audition?

426
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,823
Well, they had the nerve
to send it back unopened.

427
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,825
They never even looked at it.

428
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,194
I think that's patently unfair.

429
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,579
Is that giving art a chance?

430
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,081
Well, uh, Diane, do you think,

431
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,450
uh, maybe you're just not ready
for the Boston Ballet? Hmm?

432
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,919
Yes, I am.

433
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,920
I know it.

434
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,422
Madame Likova knows it.

435
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,424
The only people who don't know it

436
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,926
are the people at Boston Ballet,

437
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,294
and they're about to find out.

438
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,097
They're rehearsing now.

439
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:37,015
They're going to see me

440
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,018
if I have to do a grand
jet? over the gate.

441
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,521
Uh, Diane, I think
that might be a mistake.

442
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,523
Why?

443
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,024
Don't you think I'm good enough?

444
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,527
Oh, no. Oh, hey, are you kidding me?

445
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,528
I think you're wonderful.

446
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,397
Heh. So what's the point?

447
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,733
Um, Frasier, the point?

448
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,321
The point is...

449
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,823
You know...

450
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:05,077
you two have been behaving
very mysteriously lately.

451
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:05,878
Oh...

452
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,881
Are you planning a surprise party?

453
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,168
(laughing): You're onto us.

454
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:16,305
Darn! Oh...

455
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,589
Well, I will try to act surprised.

456
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,590
Oh.

457
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,592
Well, that's great, but
as I was saying, Diane,

458
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,594
the point is... well, not to make

459
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,596
a big scene about this thing.

460
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,597
You see, I-I'm sure the Boston Ballet

461
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,598
must have, uh,

462
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,599
open auditions, you know,

463
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,600
from time to time.

464
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,602
Why not, uh, wait till then?

465
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,605
I've wasted enough
time already. Thank you.

466
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,107
No, wait, Di-Diane, wait a second here.

467
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,491
Uh, oh, boy.

468
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:37,910
Listen, I-I'm going to...

469
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,411
(laughs)

470
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,413
I-I'm going to have
to tell you something,

471
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,283
and, uh, you may not like it.

472
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,585
You see, the-the truth...
the truth is that...

473
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,339
Sam, I know what it is.

474
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,125
You're afraid of losing
me to the world of ballet.

475
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,629
No, no, see, that's...

476
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,514
See, that's not what
I'm afraid of at all.

477
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:02,267
Oh, my plucky little man.

478
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,639
I-I-I...
Whoo, boy!

479
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,142
I'm just going to have to come
right out and, uh, say this.

480
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,612
Uh, I-I hope I don't hurt
your feelings here, um...

481
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,398
Please, please, please, don't do this.

482
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,233
Help me here, Frasier.

483
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,870
Diane, please, please,
please, don't do this.

484
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,159
Sam...

485
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,413
this is one of the most
genuine displays of affection

486
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,415
you've ever shown me.

487
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,751
With love like this in my corner,

488
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,502
how could I possibly fail?

489
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,805
Yeah, well...

490
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,672
Hmm...

491
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,140
Frasier, she's not going to believe me.

492
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,141
Tell her. Come on, tell her.

493
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,142
Diane, Diane, just a second.

494
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,644
There's something I've
got to get off my chest.

495
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,145
Uh... Yes, Frasier?

496
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,514
Knock 'em dead.

497
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,817
Thank you.

498
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,189
What?!

499
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,693
(classical music playing on piano)

500
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:11,286
Excuse me.

501
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,789
Excuse me. Excuse me!

502
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,540
Miss, we're in the
middle of a rehearsal.

503
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,010
Yes, yes, and-and you're
all very wonderful,

504
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,012
but I have something I'd like to say.

505
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,513
CHOREOGRAPHER: Miss, please...

506
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,015
This will only take a second.

507
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,634
Hold it, everybody.
(piano playing stops)

508
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:30,522
Oh, you may put her down.

509
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,391
Kirby, please show
the lady to the wings.

510
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,359
Oh, no, no, please.

511
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,862
I must prove to you that I indeed belong

512
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,364
in your fine fraternity. Kirby!

513
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,867
I'm sorry, miss,

514
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,236
but we just don't have
time for this right now.

515
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,205
I don't have much time myself.

516
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,708
A dancer's career is not a long one.

517
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,961
I'm sorry, but it's true.

518
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:57,799
I have a dream: to be a dancer.

519
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,302
And in order for it to come true,

520
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,803
you must see me dance.

521
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:05,807
Oh, yes, my technique
is not quite as polished

522
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:09,311
as it should be, but is
that all there is to art?

523
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,312
Mere technique?

524
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:13,932
Or is it not the passion

525
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,736
and emotion and pain that
lie deep within our souls?

526
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:22,240
For I have that emotion.
I have felt that pain.

527
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,744
I... I am a feeling person,

528
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:30,749
and I can communicate those
feelings to you through dance,

529
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:36,755
so judge me not by what
my arms and legs are doing.

530
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,762
Judge me... by what I make you feel.

531
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,264
No, most importantly, judge me...

532
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,766
for I must dance.

533
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,268
Damn it, I must!

534
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,887
Well...

535
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,056
Oh! Thank you!

536
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,391
You won't be disappointed.

537
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,393
Oh, oh!

538
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,149
SAM (whispering): Psst! Hey!

539
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,828
(whispering)

540
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,678
Never mind.

541
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:39,518
(classical piano music playing)
