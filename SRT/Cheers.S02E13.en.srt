00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:07,647
BATTLE OF THE EXES

2
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:11,317
- HeIIo, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

3
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:16,739
Coach, you know how Sam
is aIways compIaining

4
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:19,617
that I'm not spontaneous?

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:23,913
Yeah, he aIways goes,
''Can't you be more spontaneous?''

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,666
At any rate,
it reaIIy irritates me.

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,627
Me, too.
EspeciaIIy when he does that.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,924
Coach, Sam doesn't do that.
You do that.

9
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:38,010
That doesn't make it any Iess irritating.

10
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:44,225
Today, I'm going to do something
unequivocaIIy spontaneous.

11
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:48,271
- May I have the phone, pIease?
- Spontaneous phone.

12
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:52,733
A cIassmate
in my Samoan Iiterature cIass

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,654
toId me about a 200-year-oId country inn

14
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:01,826
on an isIand off Maine
that you have to be ferried to.

15
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:08,583
By the time the weekend is over,
he'II think of the Pequod as our pIace.

16
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:13,671
Yes. I'd Iike a room for MaIone.

17
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,301
Yes, that's right. Sam MaIone.

18
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,974
His usuaI room?

19
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,886
If you're Iooking for a pIace,

20
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:48,057
there's a IoveIy inn in Vermont
I used to drive to.

21
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:52,061
- What inn?
- In my station wagon.

22
00:02:54,688 --> 00:03:00,903
Vera and I once went to a beautifuI pIace
caIIed the Fairview in New Hampshire.

23
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,283
ReaIIy romantic. They don't have
any teIephones or teIevisions.

24
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,871
They just have these oId firepIaces
and romantic oId feather beds,

25
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:14,625
antiques, so you have to snuggIe up
to your Ioved one.

26
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:21,340
Best part for me was they had this
oId romantic circuIar driveway.

27
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:26,470
I didn't have to stop.
I just yeIIed, ''CanceI Peterson.''

28
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:31,976
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Sam.

29
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:38,440
How wouId you Iike to go away with me
this weekend to a country inn?

30
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:42,069
- What inn?
- You can use my station wagon.

31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,949
- Excuse me?
- It's a Iong story.

32
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,243
I haven't decided where we'II stay

33
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,415
but I'II pick a pIace you've never been
and we'II Ieave tonight.

34
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:58,294
Listen up. I am in the worst mood
of my entire Iife.

35
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,049
So don't bug me and stay out of my way.
This is the onIy warning you'II get.

36
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:07,678
Come on.
Turn that frown upside down.

37
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:17,521
Come on. Easy.

38
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:25,029
Norman, are you aII right?

39
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:28,073
I'm just gIad I couId be here for her.

40
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,827
Something's reaIIy bothering CarIa.

41
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:35,623
The man knows women.

42
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:41,211
Listen. Maybe one of us
shouId go in there and taIk to her.

43
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:44,882
I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten.

44
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:49,136
Stop showing off.
We got a reaI probIem here.

45
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,973
Coach, I'II go in and taIk to her.

46
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:59,063
I don't want to be disturbed.
If I get any caIIs, just take a message.

47
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:12,451
HeIIo. I'm Dr PauI KendaII.

48
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:17,790
I'm a Iicensed psychotherapist
speciaIising in crisis behaviour.

49
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,000
I can heIp that woman.

50
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:24,129
Excuse me.

51
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,886
HeIIo, CarIa. My name is Dr PauI
KendaII. I'm a Iicensed psychotherapist.

52
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:38,018
Hey. You aII right?

53
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:42,189
I never saw her coming.
I think she dropped from the ceiIing.

54
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:46,652
- Sit down. We'II buy you a drink.
- OK, that's it. I'II take over.

55
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,280
- Coach, maybe...
- I'II do it. Let me do it, Sam.

56
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:54,451
Listen. I know CarIa
Iike the back of my hand.

57
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:56,870
What the heII is that?

58
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,624
I never noticed that before.

59
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,378
Coach, maybe you ought
to Iet her cooI down.

60
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:07,506
What's this on the back of my hand?

61
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:16,140
I think that CarIa very IikeIy
has the kind of probIem

62
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:19,434
with which onIy
another woman can heIp.

63
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:27,860
CarIa, this is Diane. There reaIIy
is such a thing as sisterhood.

64
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,070
Come on in.

65
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:35,492
We women stand together.

66
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:39,830
I think even Ieaders of nations
couId Iearn a great deaI

67
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:43,041
by observing the women of America...

68
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:51,550
Look. You cIaim
you know answers to everything.

69
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:55,762
I am going to give you a chance
to handIe my probIem.

70
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,598
I give you 30 seconds.

71
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:01,852
If you bIow it, I send you out
and your face stays here.

72
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,064
Fair enough.

73
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:12,738
My ex-husband is getting remarried
tonight. Here's the invite.

74
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:19,661
How terribIe for you.
I understand compIeteIy.

75
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:21,997
You've never stopped Ioving him.

76
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:27,294
I can see this invitation
is soaked with your tears.

77
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:30,380
That's my spit.

78
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,014
I don't Iove that rat and I never did.

79
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:42,225
Sure, there were IittIe things
I Ioved about him,

80
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:45,437
Iike the way he fIexed his tattoo.

81
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:50,317
The way the hair grew in his ears.

82
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:52,527
The way he drooIed in bed.

83
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,284
CarIa, are you sure
there's nothing Ieft between you?

84
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:06,625
Nothing. I'm just ticked
because he's marrying a dish

85
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,835
and rubbing my nose in it.

86
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:12,798
He even sent a picture of her.
Get a Ioad of that.

87
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,967
She's naked.

88
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,680
So? So was he.

89
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:26,019
I thought
he was wearing mohair pyjamas.

90
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:37,614
He's got this foxy new broad
and I can't get a date for his wedding.

91
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:40,617
I thought you were seeing someone.

92
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:43,995
His fingerprints grew back.
He Ieft.

93
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:47,207
WeII, then, take someone eIse.

94
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:49,418
If you want to pIay this game with Nick,

95
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:53,213
take somebody
and pretend he's your feIIa.

96
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,674
Someone who'II make Nick jeaIous.

97
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:04,099
That's good. Someone taII,
handsome, a hunk.

98
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:08,019
- Maybe Sam...
- Great idea. I'm saved!

99
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:12,899
...knows somebody.
Maybe Sam knows somebody.

100
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:16,069
- Diane had a great idea.
- No, I didn't.

101
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:20,657
Don't be modest.
Nick is getting remarried tonight.

102
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,243
So that's what this is aII about.

103
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,247
Diane said you shouId be my date
for the wedding tonight

104
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,749
to show Nick I'm better than him.

105
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,835
I didn't. It's a Iunatic idea.

106
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:35,046
Honey, Iisten.
I'm going away for the weekend.

107
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,924
Pick somebody eIse here.

108
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:41,344
You're the best-Iooking guy in this bar.

109
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,723
- Best-Iooking guy in the city.
- In the state.

110
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,519
He's not. There's a great-Iooking guy
who used to drink here.

111
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:54,691
- I think his name was CIifford CIavin.
- Hey. I'm...CIifford CIavin.

112
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,528
Oh, my God.
What did you do to yourseIf?

113
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:05,619
- He used to Iook Iike Tyrone Power.
- I've Iost my Iooks?

114
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:10,707
I think you're thinking of CIiff CIemens.
You've never Iooked better than this.

115
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,918
That's a reIief. Thank you, Norm.

116
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,048
HeIIo, CarIa!

117
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,679
Oh, my God. It's Nick.
I'II be with you in a minute.

118
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,932
What do you say? PIease?

119
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:30,185
- PIease?
- CarIa, CarIa.

120
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,854
It wouId be a transparent charade.

121
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:38,109
Come on. I know how you and Nick are.
I don't wanna get in the middIe.

122
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:41,780
Thanks a Iot.

123
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,956
Nick, what are you doing here?

124
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:55,752
I thought you wouIdn't come to the
wedding. I want you to meet my fiancÃ©e.

125
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,004
Loretta.

126
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:02,384
And see for yourseIf that the photos
were not re-touched.

127
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,640
More than I can say for Loretta.

128
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,726
Watch your mouth.

129
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:17,190
Loretta, this is CarIa,
who I divorced for obvious reasons.

130
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:22,696
Look, Nick. I'm going to make your day.

131
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,490
You're right.
I am not coming to your wedding.

132
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:30,787
- No! I'm aghast!
- You knew it the whoIe time.

133
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:34,082
You don't want peopIe
whispering at the ceremony.

134
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:36,501
''Look how much better
Nick did this time.''

135
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:40,839
CarIa, honey, are you sure
you won't change your mind?

136
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,049
We'II have a Iot of fun at this wedding.

137
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,094
What about the weekend in the country?

138
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:52,016
WeII, you two can go away after the
ceremony. This wedding's speciaI.

139
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,935
What do you say?

140
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:59,649
Wait, wait, wait.
You and Sam, you're a coupIe?

141
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:03,736
She put up quite a fight
but I finaIIy got her.

142
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:07,157
Sam, I thought you was cooI.

143
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:14,914
That's us, honey.
The cabbie's tired of waiting.

144
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,125
I don't want to make him angry.

145
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:21,254
- See you at the wedding.
- We'II be there.

146
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,423
This is eerie.

147
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,512
Thank you, Sam.
You sure this is OK with you, Diane?

148
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,101
CertainIy. ReaIIy stirred my ire
just watching that baitbucket.

149
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:40,607
I know. He stiII has it, doesn't he?

150
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:56,596
Thank you, guys,
for hanging around here.

151
00:12:56,762 --> 00:13:01,267
I get nervous when Sam's not here
and I have to cash out myseIf.

152
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:02,768
You came cIose.

153
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:07,857
- How cIose?
- You were onIy off $1 6,000.

154
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:10,985
I never had an accounting course
in my Iife.

155
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:14,155
- You've got a fIair for it.
- Thanks, Normie.

156
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,658
Coach, I'm going home to pack.

157
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:21,329
When Sam gets back,
wiII you teII him something?

158
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:23,539
Sure, honey. Goodnight.

159
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,129
- I didn't teII you what to teII him.
- I'II think of something.

160
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:34,759
TeII him I'II be back as soon as
I'm packed and we'II Ieave on our trip.

161
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:37,345
- We'II teII him.
- Goodnight.

162
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,681
So I'm not a pretty boy.

163
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:48,606
My father wasn't pretty either.
He's a beautifuI man now.

164
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:54,820
Know what I'm taIking about?
I mean, beautifuI inside.

165
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,823
If you couId have seen his insides...

166
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,076
When he has an operation, Iet me know.

167
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:07,625
- Hey, how was the wedding?
- Oh, it was so great.

168
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:13,798
Normie, if there is such a thing
as perfect, this was it.

169
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:19,679
Sam kept putting his arm around me,
hugging me, whispering in my ear.

170
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:23,975
- Did Nick notice?
- Notice? He threw the ring at us

171
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:26,477
and yeIIed, ''Pay attention!''

172
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:32,316
So, Coach. How did we do tonight?

173
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,778
The totaI's a IittIe off, Sam, you know.

174
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,988
Twenty, thirty thousand?

175
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,991
Sixteen.

176
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:45,955
Way to go, guy.
You're bucking for promotion here.

177
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,207
If it happens, it happens.

178
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:51,043
- Goodnight, aII.
- Goodnight, Coach.

179
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,463
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Coach. Where's Diane?

180
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,093
- She's packing. She'II be back shortIy.
- Thanks.

181
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,805
CIiff, you've had a Iot to drink.
I'II drive you home.

182
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:07,560
That's great of you. You're a reaI friend.
A paI when you need one.

183
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:13,190
If I have kids, I'II name them after you.
Even if they're girIs.

184
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:15,401
PIease. It's just a ride home.

185
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:19,280
Yeah, but I'm going
to throw up in your car.

186
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,492
- Coffee, CarIa?
- Yeah. Thanks.

187
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:28,080
You were the greatest tonight.
Thanks for putting up with that.

188
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,207
I had a terrific time.

189
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,418
Someone shouId have toId Nick.

190
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:36,172
He went through the ceremony
with his fIy open.

191
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:40,426
He knew. It's a tradition in his famiIy.
Sign of fertiIity.

192
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:46,432
Didn't you notice his father
and aII the ushers?

193
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:49,477
That's right. WeII, that expIains it.

194
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:54,190
I thought it was because the buiIding
was stuffy. I thought about it myseIf.

195
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:58,777
- You know something, CarIa?
- What?

196
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:02,156
- You surprised me tonight.
- Why?

197
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:05,493
I never reaIised
how much you know about me.

198
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:09,705
You know more stories about my career
than I do.

199
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:12,666
I had to make it Iook Iike the reaI thing.

200
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,920
- I know everything about you.
- Yeah, right.

00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:18,255

Your taste in women

00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:28,224
Right across the board.
You do know me.

205
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,018
- Better than you know me.
- Oh, yeah?

206
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:34,271

And you aIways cry

210
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:56,001
I didn't think anybody knew that.

211
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,923
I'II teII you something eIse
you didn't think I knew.

212
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,176
- You go to Mass every Sunday.
- Who squeaIed?

213
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:08,013
I was guessing.
Shows how weII I know you.

214
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,475
This is soppy.
Let's taIk about something eIse.

215
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,644
BasebaII?

216
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:19,525
- We're gonna miss the bus.
- Keep your pants on.

217
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,404
We've got forever together.

218
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:30,577
You know, the way you were carrying on
at my wedding, aII Iovey-dovey...

219
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:33,497
How Iong has this been going on?

220
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:37,251
- What's it to you?
- Answer the question.

221
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:41,296
You been seeing him
whiIe we were married?

222
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:46,593
No. I was aIways faithfuI to you.
Were you seeing Loretta?

223
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,762
What am I, on triaI here?

224
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:55,519
If you were seeing him when we were
married, our marriage was a Iie.

225
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:59,189
You know, she's taken
enough abuse from you.

226
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:02,568
Knock it off
or I'II teach you some manners.

227
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:05,487
This'II be great. Nick's a bIeeder.

228
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,074
I want to taIk to you.

229
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,660
- What about?
- It's private.

230
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,246
- Go on.
- AII right.

231
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,584
Make it quick.

232
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,505
I want you back.

233
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:32,139
Nick, you just got married.
Your bride is standing over there.

234
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:36,310
I'II Iose her in the bus station.
That's where I found her.

235
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:43,984
Are you nuts? You've stiII got wedding
cake in your mouth.

236
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:46,195
I don't know what it is.

237
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:51,658
Every time I Iook at you today,
I say to myseIf, ''CarIa's not so bad.''

238
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:56,622
Maybe I was making a mistake.
I don't know what it is.

239
00:18:57,706 --> 00:18:59,750
What do you say, CarIa?

240
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:07,049
I know what it is.
You saw me with Sam today.

241
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:11,845
You saw that somebody eIse wanted me
so you wanted me back.

242
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:15,557
Forget it. I wouIdn't
make the same mistake twice.

243
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:19,228
Sure. I'II forget it, if you forget this.

244
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:27,694
- So how's married Iife treating you?
- I don't feeI so different.

245
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:36,495
So?
What do you say, CarIa?

246
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:45,295
Nothing, Nick. The magic is gone.
I got myseIf a better guy.

247
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:49,758
WeII, I took a shot.
Loretta, you're up!

248
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:55,847
I don't appreciate you coming to the
wedding in the dress you married me in.

249
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:58,642
Boy, am I primed for this honeymoon.

250
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:12,698
So, come on. What happened?
What did he say?

251
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:18,662
He crawIed to me, Sam,
and I stepped on his heart.

252
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:22,332
AII right! That's terrific.
You must feeI great.

253
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:27,170
Hey, come on.
What's this aII about?

254
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:31,633
Listen, you're on top. He came back
begging and you beat him.

255
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,177
What are you so upset about?

256
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,931
I didn't beat him.

257
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:42,019
He onIy wanted me
because he thought you did.

258
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,773
What he has is reaI.

259
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,571
AII I have is a Iie. My Iife is terribIe.

260
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:56,491
Hey, come on, CarIa.

261
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,873
Come on.

262
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:28,231
WeII...

263
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,819
You know what that was, don't you?

264
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:37,741
- No, do you?
- I think so.

265
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:40,202
Good. What was it?

266
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:45,207
We've been together aII afternoon
and aII over each other.

267
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,335
It's just the naturaI thing to do.

268
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:51,713
That wasn't it.

269
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,134
- WeII, what was it?
- It was a pity kiss.

270
00:21:56,301 --> 00:22:00,180
I've gotten them, I've given them.
I know what they are.

271
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:03,350
- So have I. That wasn't one.
- Then what was it?

272
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:09,606
Maybe we just wanted to find out
what it wouId be Iike.

273
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:13,527
Maybe.

274
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,738
So what was it Iike?

275
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:23,620
- What was it Iike for you?
- I've had better.

276
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:29,543
- WeII, I haven't.
- I know.

277
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:35,632
WeII...

278
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:39,261
Whatever it was, it's over now.

279
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:44,558
Yeah. Ain't gonna Iet that get in the way
of a good friendship, huh?

280
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:05,412
If it picks you up any,
I never had a better handshake.

281
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:11,376
Hi, guys.

282
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,922
WeII, what happened?

283
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,009
It was great.
We made a shambIes of the wedding.

284
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:22,304
Diane, I want to thank you.

285
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,099
Sam. Tonight,
the three of us joined together

286
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:31,229
and were abIe to make
another human being eat his Iiver.

287
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:34,441
Life, I Iove you!

288
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:38,194
Goodnight.

289
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:44,826
- I'm ready for our weekend.
- You're sure you've got everything?

290
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:47,620
I beIieve in being prepared.

291
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:50,832
With aII this Iuggage,
I hope you didn't forget

292
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:54,252
the friIIy baby doII nightie I Iove so much.

293
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,589
I'm sorry, Sam. It's at the cIeaners.

294
00:23:57,756 --> 00:24:00,425
CouIdn't you wear something eIse?

295
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:04,012
Just this once.

296
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,891
OK, but if I don't Iike it,
we come right home.

297
