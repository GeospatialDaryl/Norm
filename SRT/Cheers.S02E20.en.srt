1
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:07,359
NORMAN'S CONQUEST

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:11,906
You got the next round ready
for the Iadies in the back room?

3
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,950
- AImost.
- Aren't they a cute group?

4
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:17,661
The GoIden 80s CIub.

5
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:21,165
A bunch of oId widows
and spinsters get together

6
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:24,752
and pIay connect the Iiver spots.

7
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:29,381
I agree with Diane, CarIa.
They're absoIuteIy adorabIe.

8
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:33,469
- You Iike anybody who caIIs you sonny.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:35,679
AII set, Diane.

10
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:39,183
This is quite a Ioad. I'II take two trips.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,854
Yes. There is
a non-professionaI for you.

12
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:47,149
Last round, I got them aII in one trip.

13
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,576
- One more beer.
- Like me to carry it for you?

14
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:00,162
No. No probIem.

15
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:05,918
I'II simpIy do as the nobIe women
of primitive tribaI cuItures do -

16
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,629
I'II baIance it on my noodIe.

17
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:17,972
Those sweet IittIe oId Iadies
are gonna Iove this!

18
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:36,699
- Look! It's Lawrence WeIk!
- No! Stop!

19
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,491
- And you're wrong.
- In your hat.

20
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:03,660
I've Iost track, CarIa. What round is this?

21
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,871
I can't count that high.

22
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:09,583
So we can foIIow the fun,
what's this fight about?

23
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,923
We're not fighting. We're discussing a
difference of opinion. Vodka rocks, two.

24
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:21,553
I think Sam is a heartIess, mindIess,
sIack-jawed cretin and he disagrees.

25
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,183
He'II see reason eventuaIIy.
Let me know when his head Iights up.

26
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,020
You take
a connecting fIight to get to the point.

27
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:37,361
We were taIking about the way
you don't trust me, motormouth.

28
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:44,368
No, broken brow, we settIed that. You
were proven wrong and we moved on.

29
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:51,208
Credit me with enough inteIIigence to
humiIiate you in the right subject area.

30
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,795
My favourite coupIe.
Steve and Eydie Amin.

31
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,217
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

32
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:08,475
- Normie, couId this be Vera?
- With expensive surgery, maybe.

33
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,733
This is EmiIy PhiIIips and she runs
a boutique downtown.

34
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,736
I've just taken them on as a cIient.

35
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:26,451
Why are they so excited?
You said you had Iots of cIients.

36
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:30,998
They're naturaIIy happy peopIe.
They sing the Iive-Iong day.

37
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,545
Hi. WeIcome to Cheers.
I'm Sam MaIone.

38
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:42,050
- What kind of boutique is it?
- A dress shop, struggIing to survive.

39
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:45,637
Thanks to Norm,
I'II get a heaIthy tax return.

40
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:51,893
I did a few simpIe things. She wasn't
writing off her cockroaches as Iivestock.

41
00:04:55,522 --> 00:05:01,320
I'm so proud of us. Women have taken
our pIace in society as never before.

42
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:05,157
Working, doing,
rising on merit through the ranks.

43
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:09,870
We are taking our pIace aIongside of
and in many cases above men.

44
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:16,209
- Once expIoited, now we are equaI.
- Shake it up! I'm dry over here!

45
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,545
Excuse me.

46
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:23,383
Pardon me. I gotta caII the shop.

47
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:26,053
I reaIIy Iike this Cheers pIace.

48
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,930
- Do you come here often?
- What's often?

49
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:33,852
- Two or three times a week.
- Then I don't come here often.

50
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,773
- Can I have a beer?
- You toId her you have a Iot of cIients?

51
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:43,111
75. 200 wouId be stretching it for
someone working out of his car.

52
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:49,659
What's going on?
You seem kind of friendIy.

53
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:55,165
She brought me in to ceIebrate
the outstanding work I did.

54
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:59,753
I don't know. I sense something
between the two of you.

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,340
The temperature rose
when you two waIked in.

56
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:09,179
You're her new accountant.
Have you gone over her figure?

57
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:12,057
Does she have sizeabIe assets?

58
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,979
Is she showing you capitaI gains
to make you Iiquidate your hoIdings?

59
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,403
It's aII very weII to be witty,
but you don't understand.

60
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:29,533
She's just a nice Iady and she
wanted to show me her appreciation.

61
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,743
That's what you think.

62
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,831
Haven't you noticed the Iooks
she's shooting at you?

63
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,293
Like you're a juicy steak,
soon to be sizzIing on a griII.

64
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,421
Here she comes.

65
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:47,092
- Where do you want to sit?
- That tabIe's fine.

66
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,304
- What can I get you?
- Whatever you have wiII be fine.

67
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:56,685
Come on. Don't be ridicuIous.

68
00:06:56,852 --> 00:07:01,106
Let's submit this to our resident expert
on womenoIogy.

69
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:04,943
WeII, I don't usuaIIy think of myseIf
that way, but...

70
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,905
I'd be happy to share my thoughts.

71
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,616
What do you think, Sam?

72
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:18,039
- I think she's scouting your territory.
- Norman, ignore these bIatherskites.

73
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,545
- They're having fun at your expense.
- She's right.

74
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:28,675
The emptiness of their Iives causes
them to cast aspersions on yours.

75
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,805
- You can say that again.
- No, I can't.

76
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:40,687
I know these guys are joking.

77
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:46,943
They know that if anything did happen
it wouId injure the speciaI one you Iove.

78
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,196
I'd get over it in a coupIe of weeks.

79
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:58,038
Look at the way she's Iooking at you.
She is hot for your bod.

80
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,126
- There you go.
- There you are.

81
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:06,171
I've been getting IoneIy.

82
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,965
WouId you excuse me just one moment,
pIease?

83
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:13,637
You're right. The woman's a she deviI.

84
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:17,849
- What shaII I do?
- The course is cIear.

85
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:22,771
You act Iike the man you are
and submit to her every demand.

86
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:28,318
Thank you. Can I have an opinion from
someone who's had a date this century?

87
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:31,571
You toId her you were married, right?

88
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:36,076
Course. She knows about Vera.
I mentioned her a few times.

89
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:42,248
My wedding ring's there for everyone to
see, at a pawn shop on BoyIson Street.

90
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:48,421
You see? You're aIways making these
crass, adoIescent jokes about Vera.

91
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:54,386
This woman takes you seriousIy. She
thinks you don't care about your wife.

92
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:59,182
- Don't Iisten to her. Go for it.
- Be a man, Norm.

93
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:02,852
You are recommending
Norman commit aduItery.

94
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:07,941
It happens aII the time, stick.
That's the way Iife is.

95
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:16,116
The difference between ''Dynasty'' and
the reaI worId is they got better hair cuts.

96
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,743
What do you think, Sam?

97
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:25,500
I think it's stupid to jump into bed
with somebody you're working with.

98
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:33,466
I didn't mean stupid
in the uninteIIigent sense.

99
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:39,264
Sam's depressed. This is the year
his age caught up with his IQ.

100
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,061
That's years away.

101
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:51,943
- Norm, do you find her attractive?
- Of course. She's very attractive.

102
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,155
If it was me she was attracted to,

103
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:59,409
I wouIdn't be hanging around a bar
taIking to jerks.

104
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:03,413
Yeah, Norm. Do something. Come on.

105
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:08,042
- Is anything wrong, Norm?
- He's gonna take care of you.

106
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:12,881
- Just a sec, EmiIy.
- Norm. Look.

107
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:17,260
If you're scared, I'II take charge.
With me it won't be sinfuI.

108
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:19,888
Just unsightIy.

109
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:24,058
If you're interested,
strike whiIe the iron is hot.

110
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:32,775
Norman, wiII you do me a favour?

111
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,986
- What?
- CaII Vera.

112
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:38,281
- Why?
- Just caII her and Iisten to her voice

113
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:42,577
before you rend asunder the invioIate
garment of your marriage.

114
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:45,204
Diane, pIease.

115
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:49,083
- Are you afraid?
- Afraid to taIk to my own wife?

116
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:59,302
EmiIy, I'II be with you in a minute.
Quick business caII here.

117
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,182
HeIIo, Vera, it's Norm.
I'm at Cheers. It's 8:05.

118
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,685
You need me, you've got
the number here. Bye.

119
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:12,815
- You have an answering machine?
- No, that was Vera.

120
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:19,530
I think you'd better give
the Iady what she wants.

121
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:24,911
If you don't come across, she's going to
drop you Iike a bad habit.

122
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,498
Norman, has it come to this?

123
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:34,045
Are you going to seII your virtue to
the first person who buys you a drink?

124
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:37,048
If you were a woman,
we'd have a name for you.

125
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:40,343
I kind of Iike Becky.

126
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:47,892
I reaIise Norma is cIoser.
You just have to add U-H, but...

127
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:55,483
CouId everybody back off? Is my private
Iife a subject of pubIic debate?

128
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,277
- You backing out?
- Guys, Iay off.

129
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:02,365
OK, Sam.
Norm, we were just kidding with you.

130
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,910
- We knew you wouIdn't do it.
- We know what kind of guy he is.

131
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,038
We know he wouIdn't cheat on Vera.

132
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:14,711
AII right. Norm, Iook. We'II even sing
your wedding song for you.

133
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,674
Yes, dear.

134
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:23,094
Of course.

135
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:26,264
Right away.

136
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:29,892
You think
I'm the heavyweight champion wuss.

137
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,687
UnchaIIenged.

138
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:40,361
Stand back and eat my dust.
Stormin' Norman is primed for Iove.

139
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:44,240
You better hurry up.
She's on her way out.

140
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:48,161
Hey, EmiIy. Wait up.

141
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,204
Are you trying to ditch me?

142
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:54,959
It's obvious you'd rather be
with your friends. I'm in the way.

143
00:12:55,126 --> 00:13:00,256
That was rude. I'm sorry.
I'd Iike to make it up to you.

144
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,801
- It's OK.
- PIease. Let me buy you dinner.

145
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:11,058
That might be nice. But I don't feeI Iike
being around peopIe any more.

146
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,227
Me neither.

147
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,275
I guess I couId fix a IittIe something
over at my pIace.

148
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,779
Sounds good.

149
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,458
You don't have to go through with this.

150
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:41,422
Have there been any innovations in
women's undergarments since 1 965?

151
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,202
I'm so disappointed in Norman.

152
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,543
Your probIem is a Iack of understanding
of the maIe of the species.

153
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,254
Man was not made to be monogamous.

154
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:17,051
It's an artificiaI phenomenon
imposed from without.

155
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:20,179
The maIe can never
have enough women.

156
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:23,682
Or in your case, any.

157
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:33,400
Don't be too hard on Norm.
He's inexperienced. He got swept away.

158
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:40,032
It makes me aImost gratefuI the amount
of experience you've had with women.

159
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:49,291
I think by now your curiosity is satisfied,
your inexpIicabIe Iusts sated.

160
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:53,462
If our reIationship remains
as strong as it is now

161
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,925
you'II have no need for sexuaI
experience with another woman.

162
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,386
Oh, my God.

163
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:04,807
What do you mean, ''Oh, my God?''

164
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:10,938
I just never thought about that before.
My Iast woman.

165
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:15,609
- You do agree, don't you?
- I don't know.

166
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:19,154
- Why not?
- Come on.

167
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:25,661
Something couId happen to you.
You couId die or go insane or...

168
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:28,539
What happens if you don't age weII?

169
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:33,085
What wouId happen if I went down
in an aeropIane over South America

170
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:37,005
and was taken captive
by a tribe of huge women...

171
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,594
...who made me their sex sIave.

172
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:46,765
Forced by High Priestess Bettina
and her handmaidens

173
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:51,478
to satisfy them day after day after day.

174
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,733
Come on. Be reaIistic, Diane.

175
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:04,950
I thought of something. What if Vera
caIIs wanting to know where Normie is?

176
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:09,913
- TeII her he stepped out.
- That's kind of fIimsy.

177
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,749
OK. He went to a movie with you.

178
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:18,255
That's nice. Norm and I haven't
been out together in a Iong time.

179
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:24,136
Mrs Peterson, Norm's out with a dame.

180
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:26,680
Give me that!

181
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:31,643
Coach, if you were at the AIamo,
we'd aII be wearing sombreros.

182
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,897
What? EmiIy who?

183
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:38,942
Yeah. Norm's dame.

184
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,282
Of course he isn't here.
I thought he was pitching woo with you.

185
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,619
You're kidding.

186
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:51,538
Oh, man. It figures.

187
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:54,666
I'II teII him to caII you.

188
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,377
- What?
- We shouId have known.

189
00:16:57,586 --> 00:17:00,964
- Norm chickened out.
- Come on!

190
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:06,136
- What happened?
- He dropped her off and went to park.

191
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,307
That was two hours ago
and she hasn't seen him since.

192
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:13,894
If he has any pride, he's kiIIed himseIf.

193
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:18,357
- He just came to his senses.
- He came to his knees.

194
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:22,277
He did the decent,
honourabIe and moraI thing.

195
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,197
We'II make him pay the rest of his Iife.

196
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:30,285
Quiet! Here he comes.
Just act Iike you don't know anything.

197
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:34,039
Something teIIs me
you boys can handIe that.

198
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,962
She's an animaI.

199
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,842
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

200
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,723
I'm spent.

201
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,435
Give me a beer, Coach.

202
00:17:57,521 --> 00:18:03,443
- She couIdn't get enough of you?
- I had to cIimb out the fire escape.

203
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,740
You got to give us aII the detaiIs, Norm.
And I mean detaiIs.

204
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:12,119
- Is everybody over 21 ?
- Don't do this.

205
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:15,247
- Shut up and Iet the man taIk.
- Come on.

206
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:18,667
I think this just about says it aII.

207
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,294
Major hickey!

208
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:26,508
It's the onIy one I can show
in mixed company.

209
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:32,931
Norm, I hate to see you make a fooI
of yourseIf, but EmiIy caIIed.

210
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,394
She wants more?
That woman is insatiabIe!

211
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:41,731
She wanted to know where you were.
You didn't show up.

212
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,526
And everybody here knows it.

213
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:49,823
Of course.
Do you expect her to brag about it?

214
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,701
OnIy a crass IowIife wouId do that.

215
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:57,456
Let's go and taIk in the pooI room.

216
00:18:57,622 --> 00:19:01,293
Big guy wants some pointers now!
I'II fiII you in.

217
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:07,591
What a pathetic dispIay.
I'm ashamed God made me a man.

218
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:11,178
I don't think God's bragging either.

219
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:18,518
I didn't even have the guts to go in.
I've been in the car for two hours.

220
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,814
What about your hickey?

221
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:27,152
I've got a vacuum cIeaner
in the gIove compartment.

222
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,487
I'm such a coward!

223
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:36,578
Come on, Norm. MeaningIess affairs
aren't aII they're cracked up to be.

224
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:39,623
- Did they make me happy?
- Ecstatic.

225
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,875
Yeah, but that's me.

226
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:48,632
- You're a different kind of man.
- You're teIIing me.

227
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:54,137
Sammy, can I make
a confession to you right now?

228
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,264
PIease don't.

229
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:01,478
I Iove my wife.

230
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:05,065
- That's not as bad as I thought.
- It gets worse.

231
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:09,694
- Oh, God.
- Vera is the onIy woman I've ever had.

232
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:14,449
When you say ''had'', you mean...

233
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:17,661
- Yes.
- Come on, man. Be serious.

234
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,580
- I am.
- What's wrong with that?

235
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,586
I don't even want other women, Sam.

236
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,298
Don't get me wrong. I get urges.

237
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:34,344
If I acted on them,
I'd be no better than a rutting pig.

238
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:37,847
A happy, singing, dancing, rutting pig.

239
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:47,107
What was this about? You make it
sound Iike you're confessing a crime.

240
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:50,860
PeopIe don't brag
about Ioving their wives.

241
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:53,780
Have you seen guys sIamming beers

242
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:57,492
and exchanging great taIes
of maritaI bIiss?

243
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:03,665
So those jokes about Vera are a bunch
of baIoney. You reaIIy Iove her?

244
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:07,877
Course I do.
Most of them aren't even true.

245
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:11,673
Like that one about the tentacIes.

246
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:19,514
I can onIy speak for myseIf,
but I think that's wonderfuI.

247
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:24,769
You may not beIieve me, but I envy you.

248
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,980
- You envy me?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:32,444
I used to think that the more women
I conquered, the more I'd be a man.

250
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,281
And now I'm just Iooking for the right one.

251
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:38,575
Now you've found Diane.

252
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,202
When they made her
they broke the mouId.

253
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,289
And tried to pretend it was an accident.

254
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:48,209
You're doing it, too! And you know why?

255
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:53,631
Because you're a guy. Deep down,
we're terrified of being wusses.

256
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,969
Someone's got to pay for that.
Might as weII be women.

257
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:04,976
I'm sorry, but I couIdn't heIp
overhearing what you just said.

258
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:08,771
- How much?
- Everything.

259
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:12,442
I discovered,
if you go into the women's room,

260
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,572
wet your ear and jam it against the waII,
you hear the occasionaI word.

261
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,369
Just be gIad I did. Listen to me. I have
something to say to you. I can heIp you.

262
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:25,663
I want to say it to your face.

263
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,918
- You are a Iadies' man.
- I am?

264
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:35,381
Yes. You're a one-woman man and
every woman Ioves and respects that.

265
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:41,721
Don't Iive your Iife in deference
to what some beer-swiIIing swine think.

266
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:44,349
Gee, I aIways have.

267
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:51,439
Norman, they're unhappy
with their marriages or Iack thereof.

268
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:57,946
They're waiting for you to throw yours
away and Iower yourseIf to their IeveI.

269
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:03,117
- I hate them. God, I hate them.
- Me too.

270
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,536
It's time I faced up to it.

271
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:08,748
My marriage is
my most prized possession

272
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:12,377
and next to my Honda Civic,
my onIy possession.

273
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:15,421
I Iove my wife. I don't care who knows.

274
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:20,343
- Hey, you guys! Listen up out here.
- You're a wimp!

275
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,973
I Iove my wife. I'm not about to throw
away 1 1 years of marriage.

276
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:28,393
- Isn't he sweet?
- You're a wuss, Norm.

277
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,189
- Let me finish!
- Norman, stand up to them.

278
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:39,362
I won't throw away 1 1 years of marriage.
I'm Iooking for someone to hauI it away!

279
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:45,326
Let me teII you about my honeymoon
suite, or, as I caII it, the Dead Zone.

280
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:52,542
Want to see an impression of my wife at
the dentist's? Where's my jacket?

281
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:55,003
This is gonna be great.

282
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:57,338
Oh, shut up.

283
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:00,883
Doctor, wouId you pIease
cIean my fangs?

284
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:06,264
- Do you beIieve this?
- I don't want to miss this.

285
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:43,092
