00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:04,085
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,553
(bell ringing)

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,655
Oh, here you go,
pal. Let me, uh...

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:08,823
(laughs) Sorry.

5
00:00:08,857 --> 00:00:10,658
I don't have any change on me.

6
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:12,527
That's all right.
God bless you anyway.

7
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:13,728
FRASIER:
Hey, Sam.

8
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:15,530
Hey, Frasier, how
you doing, man?

9
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:17,215
I tell you, I used to
have change all the time,

10
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,383
but things are tough now.

11
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:20,786
The bar burned down, you know.

12
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,337
This is the place right here.

13
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,638
Yeah, burned down,

14
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:25,740
and I've been spending
every dime I have

15
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,575
just to rebuild the place.

16
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:29,911
I don't have anyone to
blame but myself really.

17
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:31,145
And women. Oh, God.

18
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,313
(laughs)

19
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,715
Me and women.

20
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:35,100
Oh. Yeah, I tell
you, I think...

21
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,369
I think it first started for me

22
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,138
when I hired this really bright,
blonde waitress, you know.

23
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:41,606
Her name was Diane.

24
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,857
Maybe you heard about her.

25
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,325
Used to come in and out
of here all the time.

26
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:46,427
Five years ago,
books under her arm...

27
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:50,931
And then Rebecca, you
know, finally admitted,

28
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:52,800
"Yeah, I burned
the bar down."

29
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:54,352
I forgave her.

30
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:55,670
Good night, Sam.

31
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,289
Yeah, good night, Fras!

32
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,472
And then, listen to this.

33
00:00:58,473 --> 00:00:59,640
Rebecca finally

34
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,609
admits to me, "Yes, I
burned the bar down."

35
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,111
(whoops) Was I mad, I tell you.

36
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:04,412
But what are you gonna do?

37
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,547
Are you gonna stick her
with guilt the rest of...

38
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:08,116
Sam?
Yeah?

39
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,283
There you go.

40
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:10,451
Thank you.

41
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:12,854
Come this way. Oh.

42
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:14,189
Here you go.

43
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:16,123
You earned it.

44
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:20,178

Hey, guys.

52
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,558
Oh, hey, Sam.
Hey, listen, uh,

53
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,760
my folks sent me
a Christmas ham, and I wanted

54
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,161
to surprise Kelly,
so I'm putting him

55
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:12,497
in your office till the last
minute. Is that all right?

56
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,915
Fine with me.
Sure it will keep?

57
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,182
WOODY:
Oh, sure.

58
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,401
(squealing)

59
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:20,204
Unless some city boy
lets him out.

60
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:23,041
(squealing)

61
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,193
Oh, Woody, look.

62
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,361
He's so cute.

63
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,747
(baby talk):
Yes, you are. You're so sweet.

64
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,382
Oh, he's shivering.

65
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:33,017
Should we cover
him with something?

66
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:34,135
Well, not really.

67
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:36,654
Maybe with some honey glaze
and a little pineapple.

68
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,189
That is disgusting.

69
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,090
I can't believe
you'd even think

70
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,259
about killing
something this sweet.

71
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,261
Rebecca, where do you think
hams come from?

72
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:47,181
Big, funny-shaped
cans on aisle six.

73
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,183
(squealing)

74
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:52,987
Actually, I'm something
of an expert on that subject.

75
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,273
Big, funny-shaped cans?

76
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,475
No, Carla.

77
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,510
I happen to be a swine buff.

78
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,913
You see,
your porcine mammal is known

79
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:05,115
for his superior intelligence.

80
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,200
Well, that's true.

81
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:07,502
You know, back in Hanover,

82
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,613
they say pigs are smarter
than the people.

83
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:12,406
Actually, it's usually
the tourists who point that out.

84
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:13,624
(door opening)

85
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,079
Excuse me.

86
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,081
I'm looking for Sam Malone.

87
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,582
I'm Sam.
What can I do for you?

88
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,351
Oh. I'm, uh, Susan Methany.

89
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:25,853
My husband Kirby
bought your Corvette.

90
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,505
(liquid pouring,
glass clinking)

91
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:29,074
You... You've seen my Corvette?

92
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,875
Is it parked outside right now?

93
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,627
Wait. Oh, how is she?
How's she doing?

94
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,028
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

95
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,664
Let me... Let me get my shammy
from the office here!

96
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,067
No! Mr. Malone,
it-it's not here.

97
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,768
I just came here to ask

98
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:41,786
a few questions about it.

99
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:42,987
SAM:
Oh. Oh.

100
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,224
I'm sorry. I got a
little carried away.

101
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:50,161
You see, um, Kirby passed
away a couple months ago.

102
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,163
Oh. Well,
that is bad news.

103
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:55,166
It wasn't a car crash, was it?

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,917
Oh, no, no.

105
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:58,786
It-It was a
heart attack.

106
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,855
Oh, thank God.

107
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,006
Oh, I'm sorry.

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,110
I mean, thank God that he's,
uh, not suffering anymore.

109
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,844
I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,079
Let me... Sit down. Let me...

111
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,924
Let me buy you a
coffee or something.

112
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,616
Thank you.

113
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,152
Um... boy, that must be really
tough on you right now, huh?

114
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:18,022
Well, it's been a little rough,
but I'm getting over it.

115
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,356
Yeah.

116
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:20,625
And part of getting over it

117
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,727
is dealing with all
the details, like the car.

118
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:23,862
Oh.

119
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,197
My lawyer says I need
the vehicle ID number,

120
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,531
and I can't find it.

121
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:32,202
That's U510593947-D.

122
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:33,905
Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,989
What am I doing?

124
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,958
Let me... Let me write
this down for you.

125
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,894
Although I, uh, do have
kind of a cute way of remembering this.

126
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,396
Uh, I made up a little song.

127
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,697
Want to hear it?

128
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,881
Yeah. I-I'm a kindergarten
teacher.

129
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,950
I get my fill
of cute little songs.

130
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,118
All right.

131
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,853
Maybe you could
just write it down.

132
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:50,088
Sure.

133
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,990
So, Susan.

134
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:54,826
So, what are you
gonna do with the car?

135
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,994
Um, I don't know.

136
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,096
I-I was just keeping it
in the garage.

137
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,198
I'm perfectly happy
driving my Volkswagen.

138
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,349
Excuse me.

139
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,085
Is that garage heated?

140
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,020
Oh, yes, yes.

141
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,521
Kirby insisted.

142
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:10,858
He was a little nuts
about the car, sweet as he was.

143
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,943
Okay, there you go.

144
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,211
Oh, thank you.

145
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,462
Do you have a pay phone?

146
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:17,031
Uh, my lawyer said I should
call him with the number.

147
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,633
Oh! Uh, here. No.

148
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,417
As a matter of fact,
use this one right here.

149
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,753
There you go.
Hey, guys...

150
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,598
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little excited

151
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,791
about your husband, uh...

152
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,712
(quietly):
Hey, fellas.

153
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:33,464
(laughs)

154
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,965
You know that guy Kirby

155
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,401
who, uh, bought my Corvette?

156
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,436
Dead.

157
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,154
Yeah.

158
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,839
Sorry, I can't be
happy for you, Sam.

159
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,141
I didn't know
him like you did. No, no, no.

160
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,978
No, no. No, I'm not happy
that the guy had a heart attack.

161
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:50,247
It's just that this is a chance
for me to get my Corvette back.

162
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,850
Oh, so, how do you figure
you're gonna get the car?

163
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,535
Oh, uh, that lady right there...

164
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:55,787
that's, uh...
that's the widow.

165
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,988
So, I figure, what?

166
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,073
You know, I just take her out
to dinner a few times,

167
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:00,508
let her get
to know me, you know,

168
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,776
pour on the charm,
and then, boom.

169
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,310
I'll lowball her, you know?

170
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:06,030
Well, this calls for a round
on the house, huh? Come on.

171
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,216
I don't have my car yet, man.

172
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,402
You, uh, kind of jumped the gun
on that one, huh, Norm?

173
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:15,306
Thank you, Mr. Monday
Morning Quarterback.

174
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,340
Thanks, Mr. Malone.

175
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,661
I won't bother you anymore.

176
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,577
Oh, uh, hold on
one second, there.

177
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,445
Let me just, uh...

178
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:24,916
Don't know how
to say this, but, uh,

179
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,051
I can only imagine what
you're going through

180
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:28,352
and everything at this point.

181
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:31,388
I just want you to know that
if you ever want to talk,

182
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,659
I'm a bartender, and that's
what I'm paid to do. I listen.

183
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,393
Well, thank you.
That's nice of you.

184
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:38,128
Yeah. Actually, you
know, what the heck.

185
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,597
I got a break right now.

186
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:40,932
You want to

187
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,668
take a walk in the park,
maybe, and just... talk?

188
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:47,805
All right, I'd like that.

189
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,989
Great, all right.

190
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,692
It'd be nice talking to someone
who's not six years old.

191
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:52,826
Yeah, I'll bet.

192
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,496
I'm getting my car back!

193
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,252
You are such a good boy.

194
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,688
(snorts) Yes, you are!

195
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:06,423
Yes, you did,
you used your litter box again!

196
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,495
Oh, he would make the best pet.

197
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,198
Hey, Woody,
would you consider selling him?

198
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,949
No, but I'll share him.

199
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:17,352
You will?

200
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,471
Sure. The day after Christmas,
I'll bring you some sandwiches.

201
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,257
Woody, why would you
say things like that?

202
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,876
Miss Howe, I think

203
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,278
you're getting a little
too attached to this pig.

204
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,980
I am not, am I, Snuffles?

205
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,448
No, I'm not getting
too attached to you.

206
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:37,872
Whoa, Sammy, what's up?

207
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,640
You're breaking out
the good stuff.

208
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,659
Yeah. Susan's coming over again.

209
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,829
So, Sam, how are things
between you and Susan?

210
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,730
Oh, uh, you know,
pretty good, pretty good.

211
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,699
You know, I take her out,
we talk.

212
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,869
We talk about school,
about Kirby, life.

213
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,737
You know, everything
under the sun.

214
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,673
Funny thing is,
the more we talk,

215
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,207
the more she likes me.

216
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,910
The more she likes me,
the more she trusts me.

217
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,746
And the more she trusts me,

218
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,882
the closer I get to
snagging that car.

219
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,452
Did anyone else's blood
just run cold?

220
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,887
Oh, come on.

221
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,589
I'm not doing
anything wrong here.

222
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,857
Give me a break, man.

223
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,259
You know, I'm helping her
out, as a matter of fact.

224
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,794
She's going through some
pretty difficult times.

225
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,396
I'm taking her mind off of it.

226
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,732
In other words,
you deserve that car.

227
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,700
Well, I didn't want to say it,

228
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,202
but I'm glad someone
sees it my way, yeah.

229
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,537
All right! Well,
let's celebrate, huh?

230
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,505
This calls for a round
on the house.

231
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,392
No, no, no, I haven't gotten
the car quite yet, Norm.

232
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,795
You're severely
off your game, my friend.

233
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:36,914
Game? You call this a game?

234
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,736
Sammy, I don't know why you're
going to all this trouble.

235
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,038
She told you that she keeps
the car in a garage, right?

236
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:48,676
You say the words, my kids
are over there in 20 minutes.

237
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:52,430
In 25, your car
is speeding down the highway.

238
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:54,098
Worse comes to worse,

239
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,467
they put them away
for a couple of years.

240
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,802
I mean, it's not like

241
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,804
I'm rattling around
in an empty house.

242
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,771
You're very sweet.

243
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,039
I appreciate that,
but, you know,

244
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,374
I've put a lot of energy
and time into this plan.

245
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,010
I think I'm gonna
stick with it.

246
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,244
(door opening)

247
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,630
(singsongy):
Where is Aunt Carla?

248
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,549
There's Aunt Carla.

249
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:16,570
Isn't he the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

250
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,473
Yeah. He's gonna make
a nice football.

251
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,008
(whispering)

252
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,409
What are you gonna do?

253
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:23,777
I'm gonna save a life.

254
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,222
I'm gonna drive Snuffles way out
in the country

255
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,982
and give him his freedom.

256
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,783
He'll be free!

257
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,285
Free, I tell you!

258
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,640
And he'll always remember

259
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:35,489
the person who gave him
his freedom- Rebecca Howe.

260
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,992
This is the best thing
I've ever done.

261
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:44,048
I don't mind saying,
that is one screwed up broad.

262
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,636
Hey, Susan.

263
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,021
Hi, Sam.

264
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,325
Can I get you something?

265
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,657
Juice and cookies?

266
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:54,993
Uh, it was arts
and crafts today.

267
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,226
Make it bourbon and water.

268
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,361
(laughs)

269
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,562
Sam?

270
00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,830
Yeah.

271
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:03,167
I've got to tell you,
this past week has been great.

272
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,252
You've really pulled me
out of my shell.

273
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:06,504
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

274
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,721
Guess what.
What?

275
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,390
I brought the Corvette.

276
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,292
Oh!

277
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,460
Oh, my old car, right.

278
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:14,728
Yeah, I almost forgot.

279
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:16,630
Yeah. Uh,

280
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,516
it's blue, right?

281
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,867
No, red.

282
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:20,968
Red, red, right.

283
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,169
Right, right.

284
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:23,671
Flame red, actually, but...

285
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:27,525
It felt kind of weird
driving it.

286
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,609
Oh!

287
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,561
Well, yeah, of course
it did, of course.

288
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:31,996
Why didn't I think of that?

289
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,699
Yeah, it reminds
you of Kirby. Yeah.

290
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,649
You know, it's
none of my business,

291
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,817
but I'm gonna say this anyway.

292
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,136
I think you should sell it.

293
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,505
I'm having a thought here.

294
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,940
Maybe...

295
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,808
Maybe...

296
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,511
No, that's crazy, that's crazy.

297
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,595
Well, what? What?

298
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,980
Well, I-I was just
gonna say that,

299
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,217
you know, if-if you're gonna
sell it, and, like we said,

300
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,019
we think you should,

301
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,221
then, um,

302
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,507
why don't you sell it to me?

303
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,824
Oh, Sam.

304
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,294
No, you don't have
to do that for me.

305
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,863
No! No, I
insist, I insist.

306
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,265
See, my-my only problem
is that I don't think

307
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,835
I can afford the
fair market value.

308
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,870
You know, maybe only like

309
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:17,125
ten grand over the
next two years?

310
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,293
You know what?

311
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:20,894
Let's do it.

312
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,430
I-I-I never drive it,

313
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,065
and-and you love it,
so it's yours.

314
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,001
Great. I think
this is a great idea.

315
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:30,137
I tell you what- let me, uh,
let me go get a check,

316
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:32,761
and, uh, we'll go out to dinner
and we'll celebrate.

317
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,993
Oh, what are you guys
celebrating?

318
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,995
I just sold Sam my car.

319
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,031
Oh, that's great.

320
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,266
That's all he's been
talking about.

321
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,170
Really?

322
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,304
Oh, yeah.

323
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,873
Well, he's had his eye
on that car

324
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,684
since the day you walked
in the door.

325
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,480
Okay, here we go.

326
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,182
Here's the check.
Uh, do me a favour,

327
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,150
do not cash this right away.

328
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:01,985
You know, Sam,

329
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,522
if you wanted my car so badly,

330
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,290
all you had to do was ask.

331
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,626
I mean, you didn't have to, uh,

332
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,762
waste a week pretending
to be my friend.

333
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,547
Here- take it.

334
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,624
How about that.

335
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,426
I got my car back.

336
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,466
Didn't cost me a penny!

337
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,902
(chanting):
Sammy! Sammy!

338
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,303
Come on, come on. Sammy!

339
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,056
Come on, you'll have fun.

340
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:40,190
Sammy! Sammy!

341
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,917
Woody, we're running
low on pretzels.

342
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:51,251
I know, Miss Howe.

343
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:54,221
I set them all free
to live in the wild.

344
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,093
Woody, I let your pig
go three days ago

345
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:01,698
and I've apologized every day.

346
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:02,996
Let's just drop it.

347
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,882
There is a quarter
of an inch scratch

348
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:05,917
on the right fender.

349
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,051
You can't miss it.

350
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,119
No!

351
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,087
It disfigures the entire car!

352
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,191
Listen, I want you to send
your tow truck over right now.

353
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,893
Are you laughing at me?

354
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,778
Are you laughing at me?

355
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,814
You know, fine, I'll
tell you something.

356
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,082
I'm gonna take my business
some place else.

357
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,235
Sam, may I have a beer please?

358
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,556
And let me guess-
you dinged the Corvette again.

359
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,273
Yeah.

360
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,624
Boy, I don't know, it's weird.

361
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,626
It's the fourth scratch
I've had in a week.

362
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:33,861
I don't know what's going on.

363
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:35,863
Maybe I need to check my eyes
or something.

364
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,465
Yes. Your eyes.

365
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,851
Oh, what's that
supposed to mean, huh?

366
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:43,387
Sam, this is not
a personal attack.

367
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,855
I am trying to help you.

368
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,192
Look, the way you got that car
back was shameful.

369
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,328
It went against
your better instincts.

370
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,561
Now, deep down,

371
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,864
you don't think you deserve
to have that car,

372
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,866
and I submit
that subconsciously

373
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,068
you are trying to destroy it!

374
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,770
Hey, you know, take your
business someplace else!

375
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,605
Go on! Get out of here!

376
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,774
NORM:
Sammy!

377
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,459
Sammy, settle down now!

378
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,595
Frasier could very well
have a point there!

379
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,829
You know something?!

380
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,830
Or maybe not, okay?

381
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:11,565
The guy's a quack.

382
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,450
Sammy.

383
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,684
Sammy!

384
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,854
You scammed a poor, innocent
widow out of her car.

385
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,891
Now, on many levels,
I can respect that.

386
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:24,261
But somehow, this one
crossed the line.

387
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,762
I know, you're right.

388
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:26,996
Yeah, and another thing.

389
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:29,600
Remember what I told you
about hitting the customers?

390
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,801
Yeah, I know.
I-I forgot.

391
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,169
That's-That's your turf.

392
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:35,823
It's-It's just that
I have so little.

393
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:36,874
I know.

394
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:43,614
I'm sorry, you...
I'm sorry, Frasier.

395
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,315
I'm-I'm under a lot
of pressure here.

396
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,285
I mean, I should be having fun
with that car, and I'm not.

397
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,288
It's driving me crazy.

398
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,791
Do you really think
there's something to that,

399
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:56,794
you know, subconscious
guilt and shame stuff?

400
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,796
It depends.

401
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,114
Yeah? On what?

402
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,267
Are you going to hit me again?

403
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,201
Oh, no.

404
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,235
I'm sorry, man.

405
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:06,270
No, of course not.

406
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,439
I... I know you're right.

407
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:10,424
I've been feeling
like a real heel

408
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,925
ever since she gave
me the keys.

409
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:14,895
I mean, she's so sweet
and so innocent,

410
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,230
you know, and I was just
making her believe

411
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,767
I was her friend so I
could snag the car.

412
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,853
Sam, you must find Susan
and beg her forgiveness.

413
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,087
It's your only hope.

414
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,424
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:28,776
Yeah, thank you. You're right.

416
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,160
I-I'm out of here.

417
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,996
You know, Sammy, another way
you could go is just

418
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:35,532
to get rid of the object
of your guilt.

419
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,367
Cliff, you can't have the car.

420
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:38,519
Okey dokey.

421
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:39,820
(phone rings)

422
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,788
Cheers. Hello.

423
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,123
Hello?

424
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,192
Cheers.

425
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:48,128
Turn the phone around.

426
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,097
Right side up.

427
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:54,101
Right side up!

428
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,103
Yeah. That's much better.

429
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:58,139
Ah.

430
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,507
Woody, it's your dad.

431
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,531
Hi, Dad.

432
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,568
Hello?

433
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,536
I can't hear...

434
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,574
Dad!

435
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,576
You're kidding.

436
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,910
Oh, my God.

437
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:21,445
That's unbelievable.

438
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,230
Wow! Well, that's...

439
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,048
I'm relieved.

440
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,050
Well, say hi to Mom, okay?

441
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,085
All right.

442
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,286
Bye.

443
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:33,557
Miss Howe, you aren't
gonna believe this.

444
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:36,208
Guess who showed up in my folk'
back door last night?

445
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,094
Who?

446
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,612
Snuffles.

447
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:39,830
Yeah, I guess he found his way

448
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,765
onto the back of a truck
that was headed that way.

449
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,033
I-I told you he was smart.

450
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,652
I can't believe this.

451
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:47,320
You see, he travelled all
that distance to get home

452
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,322
where he was safe and sound.

453
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,124
This is a Christmas miracle.

454
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,325
I'll say.

455
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,445
Mom said he was delicious.

456
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,536
Now remember, tomorrow
we're going to visit the zoo,

457
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:06,073
so everybody bring
your permission slips.

458
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,875
What's a zoo again?

459
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,610
Uh, it's a place where they have
a lot of animals.

460
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,329
Even tigers?

461
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,982
Yes, they have tigers
at the zoo.

462
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,700
What if the tigers eat us?

463
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,537
That's why you need
your permission slips.

464
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,106
Uh, quiet time, everybody-
hit the mats!

465
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,273
Come on.

466
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,508
(knocking on glass)

467
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,448
(overlapping chatter)

468
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,417
Shh!

469
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,489
I am teaching class.
Yeah, I know.

470
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,333
This'll only
take a second, please.

471
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,408
Why are you here?

472
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:42,826
I tried to call you at home,

473
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:44,595
but you-you didn't
answer the phone.

474
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,296
I-I've got to get
something off my chest.

475
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,948
What? I mean, you got
your precious car.

476
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:49,549
What else do you want from me?

477
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,302
Susan, please, let me just try
to explain something to you.

478
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,654
That-That car...

479
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,024
used to be my entire life,

480
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,708
you know, and when you...
when you got it,

481
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:00,777
I-I just went crazy
for a second.

482
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:01,861
I'm sorry.

483
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,493
I really hurt you
and I'm sorry,

484
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,665
and I-and I want to make it up
to you. Here...

485
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,833
and I want to give you

486
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:09,836
the fair market value
of the car.

487
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,005
This check is just
the down payment.

488
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,440
Please, I-I'm sorry.

489
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:18,445
Well, you did hurt me.

490
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,081
But I guess I understand.

491
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,450
I mean, the car was
your whole life.

492
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:24,518
Oh, thanks.

493
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,919
So you forgive me?

494
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:29,172
No, I don't forgive you.

495
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:30,724
I'm sorry, what...

496
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:31,825
You heard me...

497
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,427
I don't forgive you.

498
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,761
I mean, my whole life

499
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,463
I-I've let people walk
all over me.

500
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:37,564
And-And the minute

501
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,466
that they start to feel
a little bit guilty,

502
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,101
I-I let them off the hook.

503
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,903
Well, no more.

504
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,454
For the first time in my life,

505
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,723
I'm not going
to forgive somebody.

506
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:48,442
Yeah!

507
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:49,626
(giggles)

508
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,662
It feels good not forgiving.

509
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,647
Yeah, well, not to me
it doesn't.

510
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,148
I mean, listen,

511
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,518
why-why don't you forgive me
and not forgive some other guy.

512
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,486
You know, an every other thing.

513
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,122
Sam, if you feel
guilty, I'm glad.

514
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,289
You deserve it.

515
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,025
Now excuse me. I have
a class to teach.

516
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:06,527
Oh, no, listen, I'm not leaving

517
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:07,661
until you forgive me.

518
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:08,862
Sorry.

519
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:09,913
I'm serious.

520
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:12,549
Listen, this is very
important to me, Susan...

521
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,851
Oh, my God.

522
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,602
What did you do to those kids?

523
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,507
(quietly):
It's quiet time.

524
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,675
Now go.

525
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,343
No, hey, I...

526
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,013
I'm sitting right here
until you forgive me.

527
00:19:27,014 --> 00:19:29,716
All right, then you're
just gonna have to be a part of class.

528
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:30,850
Whatever.
All right.

529
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:32,119
All right, quiet time is over.

530
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,320
Everybody up.

531
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:34,638
Back to your chairs.

532
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,339
Boys and girls,

533
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,858
I would like you all
to meet someone.

534
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,492
This is Sam.

535
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,062
ALL:
Hi, Sam!

536
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,530
Yeah, hi, boys and girls.

537
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,065
Listen, I'm gonna
be sitting right here

538
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,699
until your teacher forgives me.

539
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,684
So you just carry on.

540
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:48,835
Go ahead.

541
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:51,188
Class, do you remember

542
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,590
when we were talking
about telling the truth?

543
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,392
ALL:
Yes.

544
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:59,279
Well, Sam here told a fib.

545
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:00,680
ALL:
Boo!

546
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,050
And what

547
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,884
kind of people tell fibs?

548
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,221
ALL:
Bad people!

549
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:10,290
Oh, wait.
Hold on a second.

550
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:11,458
So, I did a bad thing.

551
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,959
Please, just can't you
forgive me?

552
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,529
And where do fibbers go?

553
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:18,782
ALL:
In the doghouse!

554
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,217
I'm sorry.

555
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,385
In the what?

556
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,388
ALL:
In the doghouse!

557
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,057
Oh, come on, Susan,
not the doghouse.

558
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,108
This is...

559
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:31,078
Oh, come on, this is stupid.

560
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,612
I've already given
you the check.

561
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:33,913
What more do you want?

562
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:36,716
Can fibbers buy their way
out of the doghouse?

563
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,802
ALL:
No!

564
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,371
So, why don't you just sit there

565
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,122
and think about
what you've done?

566
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:46,893
The rest of us will get
out our art supplies.

567
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:49,062
ALL:
Yay!

568
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,199
This doghouse is stupid.

569
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:55,105
And it's made out of cardboard.

570
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:57,937
I-I could get out of
here anytime I want.

571
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,906
I could.

572
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:06,013
Good-bye. Don't forget
your permission slips.

573
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,981
Okay.
Bye. Bye.

574
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,604
Sam, I've got to say,
you're quite a sport.

575
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,940
You made it through the morning
and the afternoon classes.

576
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,944
Yeah. Well, I'll
tell you the truth.

577
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,212
I was going to leave
a couple hours ago

578
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:25,482
but my... my legs
kind of froze up.

579
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,653
Oh, boy!

580
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,788
Listen, uh...

581
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,541
I, uh... I've
been mulling it over,

582
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:37,610
especially during the,
uh... quiet time,

583
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:40,446
and I... I think that...

584
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,482
I think you should
take the car back.

585
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:43,867
What?

586
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,034
Yeah. Come on.

587
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,536
I-I'm never going
to enjoy it.

588
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,237
I... I think
you should drive it.

589
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,073
And please,
once again, I'm sorry.

590
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,808
I acted like a real jerk.

591
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,679
I forgive you.

592
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,498
You what?

593
00:21:58,532 --> 00:22:01,318
I said I forgive you.

594
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,853
I just won't
forgive the next guy.

595
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,856
Hey, thank you.
That means a lot to me.

596
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,557
Say, uh...
this may not be

597
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,026
the right time or anything,

598
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,128
but you want to
go out and grab something to eat?

599
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,462
You serious?

600
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,830
Yes. Yes. I-I...

601
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,448
You know, I owe you one.

602
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:17,484
You know, we spent a lot
of time together last week.

603
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:20,053
I kind of miss it.

604
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,022
All right.

605
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,657
Why don't we take your car?

606
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,293
My car?

607
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:28,161
Are you serious?

608
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:31,598
Yeah. But if you
miss one payment...

609
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:34,935
Yeah. I know, I know.
In the doghouse.

610
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,205
You'll wish.

611
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:41,208
You know, for a minute there,
when you were asking me out,

612
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:44,011
I thought maybe you were
trying to get to Kirby's boat.

613
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,679
Oh, come on.

614
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:49,132
Kirby had a boat?
