1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,237
I think, if nobody minds,
I'll take my lunch now.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,429
Good.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,154
- Coach, would you mind?
- Here you are, honey.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,477
I've got some lovely roast beef
for a sandwich.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,396
Carla, if it bothers you,
I could eat in the back.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,557
No. I was a little nauseous before,
but I'm fine now.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,430
Great.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,120
You know, I'm starting to feel
a little hungry myself.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,232
Would you mind handing me
my lunch there, Coach?

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,316
Thanks. Thank you.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,670
Mind if I join you, Diane?

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,756
Not at all.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,749
You know, that's another thing
about pregnancy: you get cravings.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,836
Green olive,

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,516
red pimiento,

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,038
nice juicy anchovy.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,471
Now, you open
the little anchovy's mouth.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,793
Red pimiento.
Stuff it into the anchovy's mouth.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,319
Sugar.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,438
I think I've just lost my appetite...

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,516
for ever.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,836
Works every time.

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,035
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,036
- Beer, Norm?
- That sudsy amber stuff, right?

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,628
- Yeah.
- I've heard good things about it.

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,234
- How's it going, Norm?
- Don't ask.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,715
It's no fun looking for work, Sammy.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,353
- You going out on interviews?
- Three today.

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,317
My resumÃ©, right.

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,830
Last guy I show it to reads it,
laughs in my face.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,235
Why would he do something like that?

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,948
I'm sorry. It's just that
it's pretty skimpy, isn't it?

33
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,950
You were born, worked at one company,
and you're five foot ten.

34
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,634
What you gotta do
is pep this up a little bit.

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,035
- That's cheating.
- That's pepping it up.

36
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,277
Everybody does it.
It's expected of you.

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,392
You just take what's here,
just spice it up a bit?

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,799
Looky.There's Diane and her date
back from the weekend.

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,712
Thanks for dropping me off, Walter.
Bye-bye.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,590
Do you wanna hear me do it
one last time?

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,473
No, Walter.
I have to get to work now.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,158
28.

43
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,476
Introduce me to your co-workers.
They'd get a bang out of this.

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,511
I don't think...

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,757
Hello, Sam.
Walter Franklin, Sam Malone.

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,669
- How do you do?
- Ten.

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,554
He can tell you instantly how many
letters there are in any sentence.

48
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,795
66.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,150
- That's quite a gift.
- 15.

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,353
- We've been at it all weekend.
- How many days was it like?

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,391
24.

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,555
Listen, Walter,
I have to go to work now.

53
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,639
- Thanks again for a lovely weekend.
- Two sentences. 30 and 28.

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,599
- Stop doing that.
- 19.

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,517
- I mean it.
- Seven.

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,393
That's enough of this.
I'd better get going.

57
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,114
Goodbye, Diane. Nice seeing you, Sam.

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,196
- Yeah.
- Four.

59
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,557
- By the way, Walter...
- 14. Yes, Sam. What is it?

60
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,069
How was Diane on a scale of 100?

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,474
29.

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,716
Quite a catch.

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,718
- Thank you.
- So's a largemouth bass.

64
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,474
Walter happens to be
a distinguished geneticist.

65
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,556
He studies genets.

66
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,752
Nice to be back.

67
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,677
OK, Sammy, we're rolling here.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,076
Those job offers
ought to start pouring in now.

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,033
"Norm Peterson: thought-provoking,

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,197
poignant, hilarious,
a roller coaster of emotions."

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,075
"If you hire only one accountant
this year, make it Norm Peterson."

72
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,349
What is this?

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,189
He had the paper open
on the movie section, Sam.

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,435
Here's the part I like best:

75
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,155
"At last, an accountant
the whole family can go see."

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,354
It's no use.
Nobody's gonna hire me anyway.

77
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,948
Hang in there. Something'll turn up.

78
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,550
You ever thought about doing
anything else besides accounting?

79
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,636
I was in the motor pool
in the service.

80
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,716
- I learned about engines.
- Like what?

81
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,796
How to use them for shade.

82
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,988
Let's go and have a look
at these want ads.

83
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,392
Hello, there.

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,433
- Did you have a nice weekend?
- I had a wonderful weekend.

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,348
Went to Martha's Vineyard,
long walks on the beach,

86
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,359
hiked over the dunes,
crisscrossed the island on bicycles.

87
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,436
Still couldn't lose him?

88
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,198
You now,
you are the last person in the world

89
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,154
who should take shots
at somebody else's choice of dates.

90
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,750
Not with the coterie of Betty Boops
you squander you time,

91
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,519
money and hormones on.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,633
- I date terrific women.
- Yes. And talented.

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,753
Without them, the art of gum-snapping
might be lost for ever.

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,919
At least my dates don't count
the number of letters in sentences.

95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,395
Your dates can't form sentences.

96
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,635
OK. You like dating nerds,
nerds it is.

97
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,991
The next time I decide to go out,
I'll check with you first.

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,475
That would be a very good idea.

99
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,358
I suppose you know better than I
whom I should date?

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,871
I do, lady. I could set you up
with the best date you ever had.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,754
- That's ridiculous.
- I could. Do you want me to?

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,311
Would you let me set you up?

103
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,354
Yeah. Why not?

104
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,277
I'm tempted to do this, to see
what kind of a joke you'd bring in.

105
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,392
- I haven't had a laugh for a week.
- Certainly not in a weekend.

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,273
- I resent that.
- 11 .

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,959
All right, Mr Matchmaker, you're on.
Let's set each other up.

108
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,548
You got it.
You're not gonna pull out on me?

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,877
If you go out with mine,
I'll go out with yours.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,436
- Tomorrow night?
- Well, I'll have...

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,552
I just thought of the perfect woman.

112
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,150
Yes. Bright, witty, attractive.

113
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,475
Perfect.

114
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,194
- This is great. I can't wait.
- All right. OK.

115
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,276
8.30 tomorrow night?

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,956
Two draughts.

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,799
Carla, who do I know
who'd be a good match for Diane?

118
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,750
What about that guy you used to
play ball with, Fred Wilson?

119
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,836
Fred's dead, Carla.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,676
So, she has to drive.

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm serious. Coach, who do you think?

122
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,556
You know, Sam, I always thought
you'd make a great date for Diane.

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,636
Coach, that's crazy.

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,400
- Or is it?
- Let me think about that.

125
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,759
Of course. That's what she's doing.
That's cute. That is cute.

126
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,917
- Thanks. I have lost a few pounds.
- No.

127
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Don't you see what she's doing?

128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,393
She's setting me up with herself.

129
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,954
- That little scamp.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,517
You heard what she said. "Bright,
witty, attractive, the perfect girl."

131
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,870
She's talking about herself.
Who else?

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,072
She's not gonna bring another girl
in here tomorrow night.

133
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,998
She wants to go out with me herself.

134
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,270
I kind of like that. Our first date.

135
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,476
Thanks, Coach. lf there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

136
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,229
Sam, by the way,
there is... one little thing.

137
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,275
If you get some time later, could you
tell me what we were talking about?

138
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,152
You bet.

139
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,236
I'm looking forward to it.

140
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,716
I'm feeling like
quite the matchmaker.

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,389
I called my friend. She said
she'd love to go out with Sam.

142
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,510
Carla, do you have any idea
who Sam has in store for me?

143
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,433
No.

144
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,708
Sammy,
you're looking pretty sharp tonight.

145
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,834
- What's the occasion there, Sam?
- I've got a very big blind date.

146
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,555
- Isn't that a little risky there?
- Not in this case. Coach.

147
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,873
Sam.

148
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,070
Sammy, watching you
get ready for a date

149
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,239
is like watching a great matador
prepare for a bullfight.

150
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,875
I hate that stuff. Who wants to see
a guy go and manipulate and torment

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,036
a poor unthinking creature like that?

152
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,515
I always buy 'em breakfast, don't I?

153
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,994
But looky here. Here comes Diane.

154
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,112
Strangest thing,
she appears to be alone.

155
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,310
Mind if I sit here, Sammy?

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,192
Enjoy.

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,872
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,718
Hi, Diane.

159
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,115
Sam, ready for your date?

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,995
- I certainly am. Are you for yours?
- As I'll ever be. Is he here?

161
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,114
Kind of a dumb question. Of course
he's here. Present and accounted for.

162
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,596
But wherever
is my date for the evening?

163
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,712
- She went to lock the car.
- She what?

164
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,752
Gretchen went back
to make sure her car was locked.

165
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,518
Gretchen?

166
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,949
The point is,
she is a woman of substance.

167
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,071
She's going to challenge you.

168
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,316
- Gretchen?
- Yes.

169
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,318
Here she is.
Gretchen Darrow, Sam Malone.

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,714
- Hello.
- Hi.

171
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,756
You and Gretchen
have a lot in common.

172
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,429
She's a grad student
working on her thesis in kinesiology.

173
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,076
Small world.

174
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,872
That's the study
of physical movement, Sam.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,518
Akin to athletics.
She also lettered in three sports.

176
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,076
So, you're the Sam Malone
that used to pitch for the Sox?

177
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,351
Yeah, as a matter of fact I am.

178
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,189
Coach, why don't you get
Gretchen here something to drink?

179
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,673
Thanks, Sam.

180
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,073
- I can't believe this.
- I knew you'd like her.

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,156
I'm a pretty good judge of people.

182
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,794
So, let's see how you are.

183
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,876
Where's my guy?

184
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,909
Your guy? As a matter of fact,
he's in the poolroom.

185
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,233
Shut up.

186
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,353
I'll just go back and get him
right now. You just hang on here.

187
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,796
He's probably right back here.

188
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,871
Excuse me.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,831
What's your name?

190
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,678
Andy. Why?

191
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,872
- What are you doing tonight, Andy?
- Why do you ask?

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,116
No.

193
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,470
I got an extra girl on my hands.

194
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,715
I see.

195
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,912
It's worth $20
if you'll go out with her.

196
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,031
Why give me 20 bucks
to take out a girl?

197
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,355
The 20 bucks is for a little lie.

198
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,598
Pretend we've known each other a long
time and we set this up yesterday.

199
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,757
What d'you say?
My name's Sam, by the way.

200
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,795
I probably know that, don't I?
What if this girl doesn't like me?

201
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,673
That's alright.
She doesn't like anybody.

202
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,794
What are you looking at, endomorph?

203
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,598
Nothing. Nothing, sir.

204
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,751
Andy, I'd like you to meet Diane.
And this is Gretchen.

205
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,029
I finally meet Gretchen.
Sam talks about you all the time.

206
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,914
- Gretchen, Gretchen, Gretchen.
- He just met me.

207
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,429
But I knew
you'd be coming along any day.

208
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,791
No, this is your date,
Diane Chambers.

209
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,228
- Hello.
- How do you do?

210
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,875
Diane, I'd like you to meet
my good buddy Andy... Andy.

211
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,636
Andy Andy.

212
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,194
That should be easy to remember.

213
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,508
- How do you two know each other?
- She asks good questions.

214
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,835
- Good question.
- We met in the pool...

215
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,795
At the Y. We do a lot of swimming,
kicking, all your basic water sports.

216
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,071
Now we're getting into your area
of expertise, aren't we?

217
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,317
Swimming is one of the finest
cardiopulmonary exercises.

218
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,716
It's wonderful for the development
of the major muscle groups,

219
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,195
particularly the <i>latissimus dorsi.</i>

220
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,312
I bet you're kicking yourself
that I got to her first.

221
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,591
We're gonna take off now.
You two have a good time.

222
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,233
You two, too.

223
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,558
Andy Andy and I will have fun fun.

224
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,751
So, what do you think, Andy?
How does ltalian food sound?

225
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,668
I've been hungry
for Italian food all day.

226
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,950
Anywhere but <i>Via Milano.</i>

227
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,914
That's bad memories for me.
I killed a waitress there.

228
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,513
- We'll double.
- Did you hear what he said?

229
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,713
Listen, Coach,
you're not gonna believe this.

230
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,833
- I was just talking to the guys...
- I'd like to believe it, Carla.

231
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,236
No, coach, not that.

232
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,710
You know who that guy
that Sam just set Diane up with is?

233
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,989
Who?

234
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,352
He just got out of the pen after
doing 10 years for manslaughter.

235
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,839
That must be them now. I saw them
taking off on a motorcycle.

236
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,114
Diane had to ride piggyback
on a motorcycle? That's great.

237
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,835
You didn't think we were gonna make
that last jump, did you?

238
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,077
Here we are. Anybody need anything?

239
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,156
A five-minute head start?

240
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,835
Why don't we sit down and pick up
the conversation where we left off?

241
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,873
So, where were we?

242
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,515
Yeah, that was about it.

243
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,033
You ever dream that you have claws?

244
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,429
That's it for me. I've gotta run.

245
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,630
Don't get up. I'm warning you.

246
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,716
Good night, all.

247
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,593
If you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go scrape the bugs off my teeth.

248
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,759
Well, I guess that just about
does it there for you, Andy.

249
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,520
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

250
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,189
- Sam, everything alright?
- Perfect.

251
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,551
Hard to tell. She didn't say much.

252
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,830
Except for that little scream
she let out

253
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,350
when I asked the waiter
for a sharper knife.

254
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,153
Bye.

255
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,914
Is he...?

256
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,796
He's gone. Yeah.

257
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,836
In that case,

258
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,596
let me just say...

259
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,912
of all the cheap, small-minded,

260
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,794
creepy, sophomoric pranks

261
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,435
you have perpetrated
in your long, arrested adolescence,

262
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,597
this is far and away the worst.

263
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,916
How could you, Sam?

264
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,670
So, he wasn't your ideal date.

265
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm big enough to admit
when I'm wrong.

266
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,950
Did you really think
this was amusing?

267
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,036
Did you have lots of laughs
planning it?

268
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,799
Diane, I swear,
I wasn't trying to be funny.

269
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,876
What were you trying to do?

270
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,360
The truth is, I never saw the guy
before in my life.

271
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,871
I met him in the back room
and I paid him to go out with you.

272
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,153
You hired a murderer
to take me out for the evening.

273
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,959
It's kind of funny
when you put it that way.

274
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,753
Look, I actually didn't think
that you were gonna get me a girl.

275
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,677
What did you think I'd get you?

276
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,872
I... Well, I guess I...

277
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,994
I thought that you were
talking about us. You and me.

278
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,433
I thought that you thought you were
the ideal date for me and vice versa.

279
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,914
Really?

280
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,077
- You thought that we...?
- I'm embarrassed.

281
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,156
I am so embarrassed.

282
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,436
I understand.

283
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,190
- Poor Sam.
- Thank you so much.

284
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,799
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "Poor Sam"?

285
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,193
I didn't realise you were carrying
such a torch for me.

286
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,310
No. I didn't say
I was carrying a torch for you.

287
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
I said I thought you were
carrying a torch for me.

288
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,548
I'm certainly not
carrying a torch for you.

289
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,399
Then I'm not carrying
a torch for you.

290
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,516
Fine.

291
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,393
Sam...

292
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,635
If you'll admit that you are
carrying a little torch for me,

293
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,070
I'll admit that
I'm carrying a little one for you.

294
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,395
I am carrying a little torch for you.

295
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,272
Well, I'm not carrying one for you.

296
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,955
- Then I'm not carrying one for you.
- You just said you were.

297
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,038
I said that only to get you
to admit that you are.

298
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,116
You're making a fool of yourself.

299
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,515
Just admit that
you're hung up on me, dammit.

300
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,959
- I am not.
- You are, too.

301
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,149
I am not!

302
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,955
Please! Do you think
I'd behave like this in your home?

303
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,470
Sorry.

304
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,433
Well, we are being
awfully childish about this.

305
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,549
Maybe.

306
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,150
Let's leave it at this.
I'm rubber and you're glue.

307
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,192
Everything you say bounces off me
and sticks to you.

308
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,153
- You love me.
- I do not.

309
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,635
- Do, too!
- Do not!

310
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,756
That is the most embarrassing display
I have ever seen.

311
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,078
You're absolutely right. Anybody
can see she's crazy about him.

312
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,589
Are you crazy? He's nuts about her.
