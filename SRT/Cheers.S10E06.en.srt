Oh, hey, Woody,

here's my video
camera.

40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,686
WOODY: Oh,

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,954
wow!

42
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,991
Looks kinda
complicated.

43
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,327
That's, that's just
the case, Woody.

44
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,830
Uh-oh.

45
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,499
No, Woody, it's not
as complicated as it looks.

46
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,368
I'll, uh, I'll talk ya
through it.

47
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,536
Uh-oh.

48
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,272
Whatcha doin', Wood?

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,708
Oh, well, uh, I want Kelly
to meet my parents,

50
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,810
and, uh, I can't afford
to fly her out there,

51
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,812
so I figured what better
way to introduce her

52
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,847
to my parents in person
than on tape?

53
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,484
Don't forget, Woody, you gotta
set your white balance.

54
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,618
What's that?

55
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,354
Well, the tape might
be a little tinted,

56
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,189
so you gotta balance it
out by, uh,

57
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,324
pointing the lens
at a flat white surface.

58
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,625
Hey, Lilith,

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,962
we were just talking
about you.

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,798
Carla, I'm long
past caring

61
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,034
what anyone in this bar
has to say about me.

62
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,171
What did they say?

63
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,409
I am the one who's gonna
be all bloated.

64
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,977
I'm the one who's gonna gain
all the weight,

65
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,946
be up all night eating ice cream
and pickles,

66
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,115
and I'm gonna be the one
who's vomiting all morning.

67
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,282
Yeah? Try
doing that

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,517
with Vera standing
over you saying,

69
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,786
"You gotta clean up your act,
mister."

70
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,156
Can you believe this?

71
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,525
I'm not even pregnant,
yet he is insisting

72
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,427
that the child have
his last name.

73
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,962
Just give me
one good reason

74
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,864
why its last name
can't be Howe.
How about this?

75
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,632
Howe's a stupid name.

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,567
Excuse me?

77
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,935
Come on. It's not even a name.

78
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,071
It's more of a, of a question.

79
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,406
Rebecca Howe.

80
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,640
Rebecca why.

81
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,075
Rebecca who, what, where.

82
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,778
You know, I can make fun
of your name, too.

83
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,879
Oh, yeah?

84
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,681
Malone.

85
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,084
Malone.

86
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,420
Oh, all right, I'm not
very good at it yet.

87
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,421
Oh, really?

88
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,522
Howe surprising.

89
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,589
Howe remarkable.

90
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,158
Knock it off!

91
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,160
Come on, when you were
a kid, admit it,

92
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,995
didn't-didn't people
make fun of your name?

93
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,563
Yes, but that was
in the context

94
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,899
of making fun of
many other things.

95
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,734
And what makes your
name so special?

96
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,902
I'll tell you why.

97
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,305
Because Malone is a very
proud old Irish name.

98
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,274
When my great
grandfather came

99
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,276
from County Cork
to this city,

100
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,545
they actually had signs
in some of the windows

101
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,947
that said "No Irish
need apply".

102
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,782
His friends told him
to change his name

103
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,651
to Smith or something,
but he wouldn't do it.

104
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,319
He was proud
of his name.

105
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,388
And when we have a kid,
I want,

106
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,423
want him to be proud
of his name, too.

107
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,092
There.

108
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,260
Is that reason enough
for you?

109
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,395
No.

110
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,000
Sam, you know, you wouldn't
have these problems

111
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,302
if you just made an honest
woman out of Miss Howe.

112
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,671
Ooh, what're you talking about,
Woody?

113
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,073
Well, back in Hanover we have
this little tradition.

114
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,408
It's called marriage.

115
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,809
It's to avoid

116
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,313
another little tradition
called hellfire.

117
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,748
Woody,
come on, man.

118
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,583
This is the '90s.
You know,

119
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,652
plenty of people have babies
without being married.

120
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,655
Oh, what? You got a
problem with that?

121
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,657
Well, if you want the truth,

122
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,659
I do think it's
a little irresponsible.

123
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,763
And remember, this is coming
from Norm Peterson.

124
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,898
I can't believe this.

125
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,600
You guys feel
the same way?

126
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,535
I kind of do.
Me, too.

127
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,805
Move to California, you freaks.

128
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,342
Guys, guys,

129
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,477
come on. I mean, look at me.
I'm not getting any younger

130
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,146
and neither is...

131
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,380
well, it's true.

132
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,049
I mean, look at how many
years we've been wasting

133
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,483
looking for the perfect
relationship.

134
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,118
And what'd it get us?
Nothing.

135
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,553
At least you
and I are friends.

136
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,722
You know, we care
for each other.

137
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,791
And right about now,
that's looking good.
Based on that,

138
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,459
we-we want to

139
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,561
hang out together and
have a family.
Yeah.

140
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,862
Sam, if you feel that way,

141
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,364
why don't you just go ahead
and get married?

142
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,866
Ooh, that's an awful
big step, Woody.

143
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,902
Hey, Sammy,

144
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,603
if you want my two cents,

145
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,305
I think that you and Rebecca

146
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,940
having a kid together
is very immoral.

147
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,075
Oh...
Now,

148
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,844
you and me havin' a kid
outta wedlock...

149
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,846
that'd be a blast.

150
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,083
People, people,

151
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,386
we cannot impose our own moral
belief systems on these two.

152
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,454
Yes, thank you
very much.

153
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,089
The real question is:

154
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,358
Will they make
responsible parents?

155
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,659
That's right!

156
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,328
And the answer
is an emphatic "no!"

157
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,696
Hey!

158
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,898
Sam, up until now, you
and Rebecca have not taken

159
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,967
into account the years
of sacrifice

160
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,536
involved in the raising
of a child.

161
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,871
You have not reckoned
with the fact

162
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,439
that as soon as you have one,

163
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,008
your lives will be
irrevocably altered.

164
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,776
An infant demands
constant attention.

165
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,177
24 hours a day.

166
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,779
Seven days a week.

167
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,414
It never says "please"
or "may I?"

168
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,548
It just demands.

169
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,950
Let me have a scotch.

170
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,519
And say good-bye
to vacations.

171
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,188
Say good-bye to ski weekends

172
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,391
because your life is
baby, baby, baby.

173
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,593
Can I get a drink, please?!

174
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,028
SAM:
You know something?

175
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,195
I-I'm really hurt.

176
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,530
I've got to admit

177
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,699
that you guys don't have
enough faith in me

178
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,201
to see that I'm really serious
about this thing.

179
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,803
Anyway, the
whole point is

180
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,171
Rebecca and I believe
in what we're doing.

181
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,739
Am I right?

182
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,608
Can we still get
out of it, Sam?

183
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,809
Well...
What.

184
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,943
come here.

185
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,512
Look, those guys have
some good points.

186
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,947
I mean, how do we know
we're gonna be good parents?

187
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,182
How does
anybody know?

188
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,584
Maybe a little practice
would help ease your nerves.

189
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,752
Would the two of you like

190
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,287
to take care of Frederick
for an evening?

191
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,989
It may provide you
with some

192
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,657
confidence in your
parenting skills

193
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,092
as well as give us
a break

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,428
from that 16-year-old
bundle of breasts

195
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,431
Frasier insists is God's
gift to babysitting.

196
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,804
Would that make
you feel better?

197
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,672
Yeah, I think
it's a good idea.

198
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,107
I think it's good.
When can we do that?

199
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,209
Well, let me see.

200
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,211
Uh, tonight,

201
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,213
oh, well, Frederick has
his story hour

202
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,215
at the library tonight.

203
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,684
Tomorrow is our Mommy
and Me class.

204
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,787
Friday is Aqua Tots.

205
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,689
Let me look at next month.

206
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,091
Oh, well, listen, don't
worry about it.

207
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,759
All we have to do is
find somebody else

208
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,927
and take care
of their kids.

209
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,929
Nobody else in this
bar has any kids.

210
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,163
Carla does.

211
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,264
No!

212
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,432
Forget it! No!

213
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,002
Sam, wait a minute.
No!

214
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,670
No, look, I am not
gonna have a baby

215
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,338
until I know I'll
be a good parent.

216
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,840
Taking care of
Carla's kids

217
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,575
is not gonna prove that
you're a good parent.

218
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,778
It just proves that
you can survive
in the wild.

219
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,780
Carla, Sam and I want
to take care of your kids.

220
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,881
Is that okay with you?

221
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,082
All of 'em?

222
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,283
For how long?

223
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,351
The whole night.

224
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,153
And I don't have
to be there?

225
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,321
No.

226
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,390
Oh, bless you!

227
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,958
Come on, no,
no, stop it!

228
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,259
Listen, stop it!
Come on, get...

229
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,594
Ow!

230
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,730
We'll be there
at 7:00.

231
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,699
Now, hey, come on, honey.

232
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,867
It's not too late.

233
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,002
May-may-maybe Freddie
can squeeze us in.

234
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,205
A whole night

235
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,508
without my kids.

236
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,545
Thank you, Saint Jude,

237
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,682
patron saint of lost causes.

238
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,819
I have prayed for this day
for 18 years.

239
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,821
First you freed me from Diane.

240
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,824
And now this!

241
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,992
I am blessed!

242
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,394
I am truly blessed.

243
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,063
Carla, do you realize

244
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,597
that you're the same height
kneeling down

245
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,299
as you are standing up?

246
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,208
Hi, Mom and Dad.

247
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,144
Uh, I want you to meet
Kelly, my girlfriend.

248
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,146
She's holding
the camera.

249
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,583
She's a beautiful girl.

250
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,253
Blond hair, great smile,

251
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,256
sparkling personality.

252
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,425
I wish you could see her.

253
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,297
Kelly, say hi to my parents.

254
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,298
Now!

255
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,136
Hi.

256
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,637
Now!

257
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,075
Well, what'd
you think?

258
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,012
Pretty special, huh?

259
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,947
Kelly, say good-bye
to my parents.

260
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,148
Now!

261
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,919
Bye.

262
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,589
That was great.

263
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,057
Let's turn this baby on

264
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,760
and shoot it before
we get stale.

265
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,362
Hey, excuse me, Wood.

266
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,431
Don't you think maybe your
parents would like a shot

267
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:33,866
with the two of you in it?

268
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,100
Huh? Yeah.

269
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,136
What do you say we sit down
and chat about it?

270
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,038
Get a few ideas

271
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,539
cookin' here, you know--
a little percolatin'.

272
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:45,477
You know, maybe a...
maybe a nice two shot.

273
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,046
You know, widen out to a master

274
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,114
with a little background
lighting for a nice halo effect.

275
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,083
WOODY:
Wow!

276
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,918
Mr. Clavin, you're
a real expert.

277
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,187
Oh, yeah, I'm a bit
of a film buff there, Woody.

278
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,289
I, uh, I admire the works
of all the greats.

279
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,059
You know, Kurosawa,
Fellini, Hitch.

280
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,061
That's, uh,
Hitchcock, Woody.

281
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,430
I just had
an idea.

282
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,564
Whatta you say we, uh,

283
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,765
have Woody start
this thing off?

284
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,800
I mean, he's
an actor.

285
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,134
He can just warm the
whole thing up, huh?

286
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,169
All right,
Wood?
Yeah.

287
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,203
Okay.

288
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,339
Ready and...

289
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,673
action!

290
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,809
Hi, Mom and Dad.

291
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,212
Oh, Woody, I, uh,
thought you were an actor.

292
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,781
Let's try this again, okay?

293
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,049
And remember,

294
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,718
you haven't seen your
parents for years.

295
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,786
You hunger for their
love and affection.

296
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,056
You want them to know just
how badly you miss them.

297
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,392
You left Indiana all
those many years ago

298
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,660
to come to the
big city.

299
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,795
You're practically
a stranger, pal.

300
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,867
Action.

301
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,105
I love you, Mom and Dad.

302
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,376
I know I should've stayed
on the farm.

303
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,044
I don't know why I left.

304
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,880
Uh, I guess I was just selfish.

305
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,215
You know, everybody

306
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,649
always leaves the farm.

307
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,085
That's why America's
in the condition it is.

308
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,288
I'm sorry.

309
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,058
Can you ever forgive me?

310
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,428
Please don't die
before I come home again.

311
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,735
Oh, Woody,
that was wonderful.

312
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,138
What do you say we turn this
thing on and shoot this baby?

313
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,281
Hey, Carla's still
rounding up the kids.

314
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,749
We could run for it.

315
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,285
Sam, no, don't worry.

316
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,354
Carla's always exaggerating
about her kids.

317
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,722
We'll be just fine.

318
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,624
Okay, the kids will be
out in a minute.

319
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,858
Just sign this.

320
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,160
What is it?

321
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,995
It's your standard release form.

322
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,264
The insurance company
requires it.

323
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,433
Just sign here
and initial the spots.

324
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,403
Okay, kids, come on in!

325
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,611
Oh... aren't
they adorable?

326
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,548
Look, they're
all lined up.

327
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,751
Bet it's not
the first time, either.

328
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,887
Look at you.
You look so cute.

329
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,323
<i>It's like The Sound of Music.</i>

330
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,092
Oh, I wish I had a whistle.

331
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,127
Here, Miss Howe.

332
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,562
Oh, thank you.

333
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,097
I always wanted
to do this.

334
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,498
Okay.

335
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,435
Now, when I blow the whistle,
you say your name.

336
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,772
(whistle trills)

337
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,207
Serafina.

338
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,309
And I'm spending the night
with my boyfriend.

339
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,611
(gags)

340
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,724
Now isn't it more fun having
this time with your family

341
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,060
than going on
some silly old date?

342
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,595
You better let me go.

343
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,364
My boyfriend's a retired cop.

344
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,433
No, no, no, no,
you'll, you'll want to stay.

345
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,934
You'll miss the games.

346
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,703
I'm missing them now.

347
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,972
All right, everybody fed?

348
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,907
KIDS:
Yes, Mr. Malone.

349
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,008
SAM:
Fine.

350
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,978
Now may I please have
my pants back?

351
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,946
Check the oven.

352
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,788
(crying)

353
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,056
Oh, what's the matter, Lud?

354
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,991
I can't find
Mr. Tibbington.

355
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,427
Oh, honey, don't cry.

356
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,263
Who is Mr. Tibbington?
Is that your kitty cat?

357
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,399
No. He's my eight-foot
boa constrictor.

358
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,868
Well, we'll certainly keep
our eyes out for him.

359
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,175
Wait, wait... hold up...
(muttering)

360
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,910
There's only seven of us.
Where's Anthony?

361
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,977
He's out doing something.

362
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:39,845
What's he doing?

363
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,180
Time.

364
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,384
Wait. Stop eating for a minute.
Stop eating.

365
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,853
Here we are,
at the head of the table

366
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,722
just like real parents.

367
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,457
I think we should say grace.

368
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,164
Now I know we're
not the real parents, but...

369
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,601
Sam, don't play footsie with me
when I'm saying grace.

370
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,737
I'm not playing footsie.

371
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,574
Oh, it's Mr. Tibbing...
(screams)...ton!

372
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,976
(boys cheering)

373
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,717
You know, now that Sam's busy
with this baby thing,

374
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,619
you guys are either going
to have to live vicariously

375
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,054
through somebody else,

376
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,423
or get your own lives.

377
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,558
(scoffs)

378
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,360
She's right, you know.

379
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,361
NORM:
Wood?

380
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,829
Thank you.

381
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:34,733
Listen, when you and, uh,
Kelly go out on a date,

382
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,036
what do you
guys do, huh?

383
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,538
(chuckles)

384
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,473
Well...

385
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,176
last night we played three games
of miniature golf

386
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,979
and stopped for ice cream
at the Freeze 'n' Frost.

387
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,380
Ooh!

388
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,115
A little miniature
golf there, huh?

389
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,484
A little ice cream
action, huh?

390
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,553
Huh?

391
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,122
Yeah, that Woody.
Yeah.

392
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,326
He's an ice-cream-eating,
miniature-golfing guy.

393
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,463
Look at us trying to sponge off
other people's lives.

394
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,864
We're pathetic.

395
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,836
Hey, Phil,
new pants there, huh?

396
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,404
Yep.

397
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,207
That Phil...

398
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,711
he's a pants-wearing, guy.

399
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,748
So, Carla, how do you intend
to spend your night of freedom?

400
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,249
Ah, nothing special.

401
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,486
I'm going to check into the, uh,
Ritz for a night of R & R.

402
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,054
Oh. Sounds nice.

403
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,322
Yeah, I think so.

404
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,625
I know Roy and Ralph
are looking forward to it.

405
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,227
Oh...

406
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,429
remember the Ritz-
Carlton, darling?

407
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,531
A night of
unbridled passion

408
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,434
that remains unmatched
to this day.

409
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,471
We've never been
to the Ritz-Carlton, Frasier.

410
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,608
Did I say
the Ritz-Carlton?

411
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,977
I meant
the Four Seasons.

412
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,046
Strike two.

413
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,218
So, did you get a load
of Phil's new pants?

414
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,957
You know, an older fellow
like that, you know,

415
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,493
you wouldn't think he'd
be able to get away with,

416
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,628
you know, still looking good
in a pair of slacks.

417
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,131
But, uh, darn if
he doesn't pull it off.

418
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,667
Lilith, please blink.

419
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,474
Okay, I hope you all enjoyed
the dinner

420
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,076
as much as the wall did.

421
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,145
And I also want
you to know

422
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,514
that Rebecca really enjoyed
the dead-rat-in-the-bun joke.

423
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,348
That's very funny.

424
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,419
(sobbing)

425
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,021
Come on, honey, just pull
yourself together.

426
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,424
You're going to frighten
the kids.

427
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,359
I don't think
I can take any more.

428
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,960
Oh, come on,
of course you can.

429
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,929
You can't quit now.
We've onl...

430
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:47,866
Okay, who-who
took my watch?

431
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,068
(mutters)

432
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,836
REBECCA:
You see that?

433
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,137
This is not a home.

434
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,539
This is a house of horrors.

435
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,440
No, you're just...

436
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,741
I mean, my God,

437
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,477
they Crazy-glued
the dryer door shut.

438
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,546
Yeah, I know, but we got
you out, didn't we?

439
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,049
But I'm still dizzy.

440
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,585
I'm going to leave!

441
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,188
No, no, come on, we can't quit.
Now, what are you going to do...

442
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,889
listen,
when we have kids of our own?

443
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,392
Are you going to quit
when the going gets tough?
I don't know.

444
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,094
Well, no! Honey, listen.

445
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:18,731
We're almost up to bath time,
then we'll be home free.

446
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,699
Okay?
Okay.

447
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,134
All right, now, uh, who's first?

448
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,136
I'm ready for my bath,
Miss Howe.

449
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,472
And I'm a dirty,
dirty boy.

450
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,240
(shrieking, sobbing):
Ah, Sam!

451
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,843
Would you get
over there!

452
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,850
Okay, kids, now let's
just get a shot of you

453
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,652
in front of the whole
bar, all right?

454
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,121
Yeah, okay.

455
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,857
Cliffy, you want
I should take off?

456
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,592
No, no, no, you stay right
where you are, Norm.

457
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,494
Uh, you're what we call
atmosphere.

458
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,496
Wait a minute.
What's that?

459
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,630
Atmosphere, that's, uh,

460
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:52,898
you know, people
in the background.

461
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,066
You're sitting around,
drinking your beer.

462
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,634
You know, it looks
like you belong there.

463
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,702
All right!

464
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,405
Hey, everybody,
I'm atmosphere!

465
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,607
Hey, Cliff, could I
be atmosphere, too?

466
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,609
Pauly, Pauly, Pauly, uh...

467
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:07,112
Personally I love you, Paul,
but, uh, the camera doesn't.

468
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,280
Scoot!

469
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,187
All right now, everybody,

470
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,956
57th take is a charm.

471
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,324
Right?

472
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,461
<i>Now...
The Message Home, scene one.</i>

473
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,829
Action.

474
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,497
Hello,
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

475
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,166
Cut!

476
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,300
(clears throat)

477
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,403
Kelly, Kelly,
Kelly, come here.

478
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,573
What I'm looking for is
the energy of take 36

479
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,508
and the innocence
of take 11.

480
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,477
Do you think you
can do that for me?

481
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,046
I'm awfully tired,
Mr. Clavin.

482
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,215
That a girl!

483
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,151
Okay.

484
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,120
Scene one, take 58.

485
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,222
Action!

486
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,824
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

487
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,392
Cut!

488
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,061
Kelly, uh, you, you
mind explaining to me

489
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,464
just what you think
you're doing here?

490
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,834
Cliffy, lighten up, guy.

491
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,036
You're just getting a little
serious about this, aren't you?

492
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,371
All right, who told
the atmosphere to talk?!

493
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,873
Go on, you're
out of here!

494
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,508
Pauly, your ship
just came in.

495
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,043
Come in here, buddy.

496
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,745
WOODY:
Hey, uh,

497
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,147
Mr. Clavin, I don't think
I want to make this tape.

498
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,248
Me neither.

499
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,116
All right, fine!

500
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,317
Both of you,
get out of here!

501
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,518
Everybody get out!

502
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:20,853
I can do the whole
project myself!

503
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,388
Cliff, please!
What?!

504
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,889
Now you'll never get what you
want by badgering these kids.

505
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:24,923
You've got to make
them feel safe.

506
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,859
After all, it's
just a videotape.

507
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,161
Now listen, why don't you
pull up a chair here,

508
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,130
try to calm yourself down.

509
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,498
Have a beer...
I'm all right.

510
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,467
We'll see if we can, uh,
get this thing done, huh? Okay?

511
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,670
All right, all right.
I'm all right.

512
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,772
Kelly, Woody.

513
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,810
Now, Kelly, just do whatever
comes naturally to you.

514
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:48,313
Relax, be yourself.

515
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,715
No pressure.

516
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:57,423
And simply say "hello"
to Woody's parents.

517
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,658
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

518
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,727
I'm Kelly Gaines.

519
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,564
FRASIER:
Kelly, you...

520
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,233
you just don't have a clue,
do you?

521
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,004
That's a wrap.

522
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,111
Boy, I'll tell you
one thing.

523
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,313
Anybody who thinks
parenthood is easy,

524
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:24,149
should try giving baths
to those monsters.

525
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,251
I learned a lot.

526
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,322
Yeah, yeah, I learned I can hold
my breath for over a minute.

527
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:37,629
Although, I can't quite
remember my telephone number.

528
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,098
(sputters)

529
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:41,333
You know something?

530
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:44,536
Carla's kids aren't that bad.

531
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,105
Yeah, they're
really not.

532
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,040
They're sort of rambunctious
and high-spirited,

533
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,944
but, you know, all in all,
I think they mean well.

534
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:56,281
You know, I was pretty much
a scamp when I was a kid, too.

535
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,517
Yeah, yeah...
(chuckles)

536
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,152
I used to, uh,

537
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:03,856
empty out the salt shakers
and put in sugar.

538
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,826
Boy, what a prank.

539
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,866
Well, Sam, we did it.

540
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,167
Yeah, hey, that's right.

541
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,568
We passed your test,
didn't we?

542
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,237
We took care
of Carla's kids.

543
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,673
If we can do that,
we can do anything.

544
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,241
You know something?

545
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,476
We're going to be
just fine.
Mmm.

546
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,146
(light switch clicks)
MALE VOICE:
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

547
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,915
SAM:
Uh-oh. Is that a prowler,
or is that the kids?

548
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:32,651
REBECCA (whimpering):
Oh, I hope it's a prowler!
