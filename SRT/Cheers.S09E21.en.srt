00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
    Okay, Rebecca, uh,          
        here's the deal.        

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,900
  I'll paint the whole office,  

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,700
      including woodwork,       
and, uh, it'll run you...       

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,000
                         400.   

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,000
400 bucks sounds reasonable.    

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,400
    Oh, no, that's 400 beers.   

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,800
         The "B" with the slanty
             line through it....

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,500
             It's kind of my own
             special currency.  

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,100
    It's a deal.                

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,800
Oh, and, Norm, remember--       

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,500
this time Sam wants             
something really simple.        

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
              Oh, yeah. I've got
        some, some choices here.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,100
        Um, I've got sand white,

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,400
             uh, ivory white,   

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,700
                off-white,      

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,500
                 Navajo white...

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,900
They all look just alike.       

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
        Well, they're different.
Are you sure?                   

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,400
              Well, yeah. Of    
              course I'm sure.  

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
          What do you think?    

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,300
        I'm trying to push      
        one color on you?       

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,600
I mean, I resent that, Rebecca. 

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,700
    Oh, I'm sorry.              

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
No, that one's                  
 fine, right there.             

26
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,500
                Oh, cream white.
    Mm-hmm.                     

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,900
            Excellent choice.   

28
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,900
  And, as luck would have it,   

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,500
  I happen to have 42 gallons   
      of it in my garage.       

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,700
      (theme song begins)       

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,100
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,400
 Takes everything you've got  

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,000
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

34
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,500
 Sure would help a lot         

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,400
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,300
   Sometimes you want to go    

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,100
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,200
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,100
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,500
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,500
   People are all the same     

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,700
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Well, good morning, Sam.        

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,500
  Yeah? What's good about it?   

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
  Well, you have your health,   
  a good business, and friends  

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,100
      who put up with your      
      violent mood swings.      

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
        Yeah. I'm sorry.        

51
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
          It's just...          
      I got some bad news.      

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,600
You guys all remember the       
Miss Boston Barmaid contest?    

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,000
      Oh, yeah.                 

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,000
    That's the annual contest   

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
            where they try to   
          find the most talented

56
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,200
                and efficient   
             waitress in Boston,

57
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,800
            which-- surprise,   
                surprise--      

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
 always turns out to be the babe
     with the biggest honeydews.

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,300
     Right. Well, this year     
 they're holding it at Cheers.  

60
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,700
         All right!             
  All right!                    

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,100
      No, no, no, no. No,       
    It's not what you think.    

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,100
                They changed all
            the categories here.

63
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,900
    Listen to this-- speed,     
efficiency, memorization,       

64
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,400
personal warmth, courtesy.      

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,400
I mean, it's like bra size      
  doesn't even exist anymore!   

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,500
    Well, Sam, they're just     
      trying to keep pace       

67
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,100
        with the current        
     social enlightenment.      

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
I mean, how would <i>you</i> like      
      to be judged solely       

69
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,900
on the basis of your looks      
      and your body alone?      

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
     I'd love it. I'd win.      

71
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
            The whole contest   

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
    has gone to hell.           

73
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,700
    I mean, believe me, I-I,    
I really presented my case      

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,000
to the contest committee.       

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
See, I made a graph here.       

76
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,800
Look at this. Now, these        
the bust measurements           

77
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,600
of all the winners              

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,400
since 1976,                     
and almost                      

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,700
 to a woman, they're over a 38. 

80
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,800
            What's this one that
             dips way down here?

81
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,200
Uh, that's the year Diane won.  

82
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
         It's no good.          
It's just no good at all.       

83
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
    I think I'm gonna           
      write my councilman.      

84
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,500
 Oh, what am I talking about?!  

85
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,500
  My councilman's a babe, too!  

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
     God, the whole world's     
    crowding in on me!          

87
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,700
        Carla, you gonna try out
        for this contest?       

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't think so.               
            Well, you heard Sam.

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,700
                  It's not about
                looks this year.

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,900
Thank you, Woody.               
                      You should

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,700
do it, Carla.                   

92
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,500
                Look, I know    

93
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
        I'm a good waitress.    

94
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,100
            I don't need        
        some obnoxious dork     

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
            in a cheap suit     
        telling me I'm the best.

96
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,000
But you <i>are</i> the best.           

97
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,800
                I just said I   
            didn't need that.   

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
  Besides, even if I did win,   
    what would I get?           

99
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,900
A lousy ten bucks               
and a handshake?                
                        Well,   

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,100
      it says here you get      
    a brand new Mazda Miata.    

101
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
    Get out of town.            

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Just for doing my job?          

103
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,500
                         Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,900
        Oh...                   

105
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm gonna get myself this Miata.

106
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
                      All right.

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah.                           

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,700
                Uh! Uh-oh. Snag.

109
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
             What about warmth, 
             personal courtesy? 

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,600
What about me shoving this      
  brochure up your nose?        

111
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
            You're a shoo-in.   

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
I couldn't help but notice,     
for the last couple of days     

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
you have just been sitting      
here doing nothing.             

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,900
         Hi. I'm Norm Peterson. 

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
      Obviously, we haven't met.

116
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,500
This really bothers me.         

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
                        Why?    

118
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,200
 Because, because you           
have a job to do                

119
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,700
     and instead, you           
  are just sitting here         

120
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,000
talking to Cliff all day long.  

121
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,800
I mean, you're                  
not even trying.                

122
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,700
     Rebecca, do you <i>get</i> Cheers?

123
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
              I mean, do you    
         understand the concept?

124
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,700
    I want to see some work     
      by the end of today.      

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
If you can't get the job done,  
I will hire a professional.     

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,700
Oddly enough, that's what       
  Vera said on our honeymoon.   

127
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,000
So, uh, how're you              
gonna get out of this one?      

128
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,400
                  Relax, Cliffy,

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,300
    I got it covered.           

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
          I have a new          
industrial paint sprayer.       

131
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,600
    Gets the job done           
     in a couple of hours.      

132
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Very clever.                    

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,600
                      Mm-hmm.   

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,200
                 It was invented
                 by the Japanese

135
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,700
 so they could paint, you know, 
 more efficiently and quickly.  

136
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
    Whereas you will use it     
      to drink more beers,      

137
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,900
         watch more TV,         
     and put off everything     

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
  until the very last minute.   

139
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
        Right. You see,         
    they're way ahead of us     

140
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,800
 in technology, but they don't  
      have our creativity.      

141
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,100
Hey, Doc, how do you think      
    I look for the contest?     

142
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,500
Well, my goodness, Carla,       
that is a jaunty bow!           

143
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
                    Yeah.       

144
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,100
        Where did you get it?   

145
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
        Well...                 

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,300
the first job                   
I ever had was, uh,             

147
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
at this greasy spoon            
when I was 15.                  

148
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,600
There was this old waitress     
     there, named Cora.         

149
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
  She taught me everything      
I know about waiting tables.    

150
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,800
Anyway, on, uh, her last day,   

151
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
the day they were carting her   
off to the nursing home,        

152
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,100
she gave me this bow.           

153
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,700
      She told me               
 to wear it with pride          

154
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,600
because being a waitress        
is a wonderful thing.           

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,100
    Carla, that's quite a story.

156
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,200
 Now, if the judges             
 are as sappy as you,           

157
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
I get me a new car!             

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,800
     (laughing)                 

159
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
    Carla.                      

160
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,700
     (clears throat)            

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
 Honey, I just want you to know 

162
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,000
that I've got some... moral     
problems with this contest.     

163
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,600
 It's not gonna get in the way  
     of me hoping you win.      

164
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
                    Yeah. Well, 
                    thanks, Sam.
          Yeah.                 

165
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,300
          Now, would you give me
          my button over there? 

166
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,300
            Oh.                 

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Here. "My name's Carla          
and I love your smile."         

168
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
(chuckles):                     
      Here.                     

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Boy, you're really prepared     
to go all the way for this.     

170
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,200
            Yeah. I got a button
            that says that, too.

171
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,600
         Think I should wear it?

172
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
    No, no. I'd stick           
  with the smile thing.         

173
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,900
                    Right.      

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,100
Could I have some service?      

175
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,200
                         Coming!

176
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,400
                Hi. I'll be     
            your waitress today.

177
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
            How may I serve you?

178
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
    I want a martini.           

179
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,600
         Dry. D-R-Y.            

180
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,400
And that means                  

181
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,700
     light on the vermouth.     

182
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,500
      And I want a twist,       
         not an olive.          

183
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,700
                 Very well, sir.

184
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,200
Uh, uh, read                    
that back to me.                

185
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,700
I don't want any mistakes.      

186
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,100
          One martini, very dry.

187
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,500
     You forgot the twist.      

188
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
          Twist it is.          

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
  I'll twist his big ears off.  

190
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,700
  Take it easy, take it easy.   

191
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
      He wants a very dry       
     martini with a twist.      

192
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,500
What'd you do that for?         

193
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
          It's nothing personal.

194
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
                  I was just    
              letting off steam.

195
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
Then why don't you              
push Norm off his stool?        

196
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,400
             You don't know much
          about physics, do you?

197
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,900
    Don't forget the twist!     

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,700
Let me see my brochure.         

199
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,500
I gotta get a look at my car.   

200
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
                     Oh...      

201
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,500
        Yes.                    
                     (laughs)   

202
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,600
  Oh, it's worth it.            

203
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,100
It's worth it.                  
                    Yeah.       

204
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,800
      Carla, this must've       
fallen out of your folder.      

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
It says "List of Judges."       

206
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,000
    Are you kidding?            

207
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,000
  That's supposed               
  to be top secret.             

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Oh, my God.                     

209
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,900
This is the best thing          
that's ever happened to me.     

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,100
I'm gonna know who they are.    

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,600
Now all I have to do is         
kiss up to the squids           

212
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,200
on that list and I'll           
be driving home                 

213
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
in a nice, new convertible.     

214
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,800
                    All right.  

215
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,200
Who are they, Woody?            

216
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,500
David Murphy, Cliff Clavin      

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
and Frank Smith.                

218
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,500
     (yells)                    

219
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Now, who is Frank Smith,        

220
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,500
and why is Carla so mad at him? 

221
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,900
                 And now, on top
             of everything else,

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,800
              I've got this huge
         headache outta nowhere.

223
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,800
              They picked Clavin
                to be a judge.  

224
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,800
                 What could they
          have been thinking of?

225
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,900
    Aw, they probably           
    want someone, you know,     

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
  with lot of bar experience,   

227
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,500
and he <i>has</i> been hanging         
around here a lot, you know.    

228
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,600
     Yeah, well, so's Norm.     

229
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,900
Why didn't they pick you, Norm? 

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,900
     Well, maybe they did.      

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
        I haven't opened        
      my mail in a while.       

232
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,200
 Once my Unemployment ran out,  
  all the incentive was gone.   

233
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,100
No doubt about it,              

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,500
             these things were a
         lot easier on all of us

235
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,100
                  when they were
            just bimbo contests.

236
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,500
            You know, if this...

237
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,800
             this is the new age
            of enlightenment,   

238
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,200
                why, why does it
            hurt so many people?

239
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
                Norm, I gotta   
             ask you a question.

240
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
     All right.                 

241
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,100
    You know, over the years,   

242
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,300
            I've been pretty    
                bad to Clavin.  
    Mmm.                        

243
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,700
            And I've done       
             some things that...

244
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,500
         maybe I shouldn't have.

245
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,500
     Mm-hmm.                    
            Called him names.   

246
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,500
            Punctured his tires.

247
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,100
        Set fire to his hair.   

248
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,400
    What's the question?        

249
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
        Do you think he noticed?

250
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,900
    (snorts)                    

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You made this guy               
    eat a bug once.             

252
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,500
Come on, that's a birthday      
the guy's never gonna forget.   

253
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
                 Okay, I'll send
                him flowers.    

254
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Carla, that bug laid            
eggs in his stomach.            

255
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,000
                Yeah. That <i>was</i>  
                kind of a bonus.

256
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
                Oh... God.      

257
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,300
            I might as well just
            chop this phony bow.

258
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,500
              Aww.              

259
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,500
You're right, Norm.             
      It's hopeless.            

260
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,700
I'm never gonna win anything.   

261
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
                  Come on.      
    No, really.                 

262
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
  You know, I thought           
    it was my turn.             

263
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,200
  I thought that,               
for once in my life,            

264
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
I was gonna be recognized       

265
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,900
for being the best              
  at what I do.                 

266
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,700
Now, because of Clavin,         
I don't even get the chance.    

267
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
            All right, well, why
             don't you try this?

268
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,400
      Actually be nice to Cliff.

269
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,200
          Listen to his stories.

270
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,200
        Treat him like a friend.

271
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,500
                (laughs):       
                I'm sorry.      

272
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
          It's the beer talking.

273
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,800
        Well, that, uh, Paul,   
            in a nutshell,      

274
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,800
             is the history     
        of Western civilization.

275
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
                  You were right
                  to come to <i>me.</i>

276
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
I didn't come to you, Cliff.    

277
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,400
I was, uh, waiting              
to use the phone.               

278
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,900
Go on, Cliff.                   

279
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm listening.                  

280
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,500
      I'm interested            
 in Western civilization.       

281
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,500
     You all right, Carla?      

282
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,800
  Beat it, lard butt!           

283
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
      Thank God. I thought      
      I was hallucinating.      

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,000
                Interested, huh?

285
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,400
Oh, yeah!                       
                That's funny.   

286
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,500
              You, uh, you never
          listened to me before.

287
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,200
        I listen to you         
      all the time, Cliff.      

288
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,100
Yeah, as a matter of fact,      

289
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,600
        I often go home         
    and tell the kids           

290
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,500
        about this very,        
    very smart man at work.     

291
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,200
      Why are you so mean       
      to me all the time?       

292
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,900
             Mean?              

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,700
 Well, like when you knocked me 
        off that stool.         

294
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,300
    Knocked... Oh, no!          

295
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
     Oh, no, that was just      
     an affectionate nudge,     

296
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,200
you, you old silly billy.       

297
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,500
    Well, that, that did sort   
                 of hurt my back

298
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,900
                a little bit.   
        Oh...                   

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,100
     You know, I wondered if you
    might... Uh, no, never mind.

300
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,200
          I could never ask you.

301
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,100
         Oh, no, Cliff.         

302
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,700
Uh, would you like me to get you
    something for your back?    

303
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
        Some, uh, heating pad   
        or some Doan's Pills?   

304
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Well, well,                     
you know a little,              

305
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,100
uh, back rub might help         
a little.                       

306
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,300
        Wouldn't you rather have
                a heating pad   

307
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
        or some Doan's Pills?   

308
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Right there between             
the, uh, scapuli.               

309
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
         Why, uh, sure.         

310
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,100
Oh, that feels good.            

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Ah! You know, Carla,            
what the heck.                  

312
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,200
I'll just take off my shirt     

313
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
             and you can come in
              the office with me

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,800
                and really knead
                      the flesh.

315
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,000
  (makes tire squealing sound)  

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,100
    Okay. But if I'm not out    
    of there in 15 minutes,     

317
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
      nail that door shut,      
          call my kids          

318
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
      and tell them I died      
    in a hideous explosion.     

319
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,700
      I wouldn't want them      
    to know the truth.          

320
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,900
            (sighs)             

321
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,000
    How's that painting job     
      coming along, Norm?       

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,700
    Ah, swear to God,           

323
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
  I would be in there painting  
    this very moment,           

324
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
but, uh, Carla's using the room.

325
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
 She's giving Cliff a massage.  

326
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,000
 Oh, please!                    

327
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,000
Give me a break.                

328
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,000
    Oh, dear.                   

329
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,600
              See?              

330
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,400
Yes, I see.                     

331
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,500
Now if you could just get       
    the rest of that office     

332
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
    half as white as Cliff's    
upper body, I'd be happy.       

333
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Woody, a beer for Cliff, please.

334
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
                        And, uh,

335
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,300
I have to get, four,            
five, six pretzels              

336
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,300
with the salt brushed off       
just one side.                  

337
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,300
(sobbing):                      
I touched his skin!             

338
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,700
Oh, horror, horror!             

339
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,800
    You might pretend           
 it's something less repulsive. 

340
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,300
Less, less repulsive than       

341
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,300
             Cliff's naked back?

342
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,700
                    Oh! You mean
              like a dead animal

343
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
            lying on the side   
                     of the road

344
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
         squirming with maggots?

345
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,800
     Precisely. Visualize.      

346
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,300
                      Visualize!

347
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
                        Yeah!   

348
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
          I think that can work.

349
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,100
                    Thanks, Doc.

350
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,800
              It's only maggots.

351
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
    It's only maggots.          

352
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,500
 Boy, that Carla sure is smart, 

353
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,900
buttering up to Mr. Clavin      
         so she'll win.         

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,300
Wish I'd had those smarts       

355
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,500
when I was doing the county fair
 circuit with my hog Maribelle. 

356
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,300
        Rule number one:        
      you got to schmooze.      

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
          You gotta go          
     to the right parties.      

358
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,100
      You gotta sell out.       

359
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
          I wouldn't.           

360
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,500
  So I brought Maribelle home   
            a loser.            

361
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
    It broke my heart.          

362
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,800
    How was Maribelle?          

363
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
    Not bad with applesauce.    

364
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,400
    Carla, you've really got    
     strong, peasant hands.     

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
    Thank you, Cliff.           

366
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
            It's really quite   
            a refreshing change,

367
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
                  you being nice
          to me all of a sudden.

368
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,700
It's not all of a sudden.       

369
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,600
It's like when                  
you're in third grade           

370
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,400
when you tease the boy          
you secretly like the most.     

371
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,300
 You mean the whole third grade 
    secretly liked me?          

372
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Forget it.                      

373
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,400
 Wait a minute, Carla, are you  
trying to say you like me?      

374
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,000
Well...                         

375
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Oh, come on, don't be shy.      

376
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,200
            Say it.             

377
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
        Say it so               
     the guys can hear it.      

378
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,700
          I like you.           

379
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
        I said it.              

380
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,900
Doc, I feel like                
I'm gonna explode.              

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,900
What should I do?               

382
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
                Find some way to
            release the tension.

383
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Good thinking.                  

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,300
            Oh! Oh!             

385
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,000
         Oh, thank you.         
I feel a lot better. Thank you. 

386
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,400
                          Carla,

387
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,200
 you know, you did such a good  
     job with the back rub,     

388
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
    now my feet are jealous.    

389
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Allow me.                       

390
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,900
    I rubbed his feet.          
    I rubbed his feet!          

391
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
                Carla, Carla,   
                 Carla, come on.
                     Cut it out.

392
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,400
             You've been washing
        your hands with kerosene

393
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,300
            for half an hour.   
                  They're clean!

394
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
No, not yet, Sam.               

395
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,100
Get me a match.                 

396
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
  Carla, it couldn't have been  
        that bad.               

397
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,200
Like hell.                      

398
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
         I didn't look,         

399
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,500
  but I'm sure I felt six toes  
    on his left foot.           

400
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,700
 If the judges will please come 
  forward and the contestants   

401
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,000
    will take their places,     

402
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,000
      we're ready to begin      

403
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,900
  the 53rd Annual Miss Boston   
        Barmaid Contest.        

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,200
  Uh, uh, I'll be right there.  

405
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,100
     I'm just gonna go get      
        the other judge.        

406
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,300
    What other judge?           

407
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
         Cliff Clavin.          

408
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,500
      Sorry. I don't know       
        a Cliff Clavin.         

409
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,900
  Well, what, what about this?  

410
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.            

411
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,300
That's not official.            

412
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Someone must be                 
having fun with you.            

413
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,200
                 Hey, uh, Carla,

414
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
                you still got   
              that little brush?

415
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Uh, you left a couple           
of crumbs on my mustache.       

416
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,300
  You know, Cliff, uh, I think  

417
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,300
         you, uh, ought         
     to keep those crumbs.      

418
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,700
They're gonna need 'em          
to identify your body.          

419
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,000
You set me up!                  

420
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,200
You put your name               
on that list                    

421
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
just so that I would            
be nice to you!                 

422
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,200
             EMCEE:             
     Contestant number one?     

423
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,600
(sweetly):                      
Yes?                            

424
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,600
If you'll take your place       

425
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,300
with the other contestants      
         we can begin.          

426
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,700
                        (groans)

427
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,100
I have to go be in              
the contest now, Cliff.         

428
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Why don't you make              
your peace with God?            

429
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
                  Are you nuts?!

430
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,900
    Did you think you were gonna
    actually get away with that?

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
            You know you're dead
                 now, don't you?

432
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
Eh, I know, Norm.               

433
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,000
    Some men have a mission.    

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
 Uh, guys climb Mount Everest.  

435
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,900
  Other guys walk on the moon.  

436
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,500
        Yeah, either of those   
          would be a pretty good

437
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
                hiding place for
                  you right now.

438
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
  I topped them all, yessiree.  

439
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,600
 I had Carla rub my bare feet.  

440
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm gonna have that etched      
on my tombstone.                

441
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
        You can start working   
        on it just about now.   

442
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,300
Contestant number one,          
you're first.                   

443
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,500
Our first category will be speed
followed by memorization,       

444
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,500
        personal warmth,        

445
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,900
courtesy                        
and drink knowledge.            

446
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,600
            SAM (high voice):   
    What about the bikini round?

447
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,400
We're well aware                
of your views, Mr. Malone.      

448
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,900
 And now let the contest begin. 

449
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,500
             EMCEE:             
        Thank you.              
    Very nicely done.           

450
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,300
That concludes our competition. 

451
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
As the judges tally their votes,

452
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,400
     let's have a big round     
          of applause           

453
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,700
  for all of our contestants.   

454
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
                          Sammy,
You did great.                  

455
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
          oh, Sammy, I've really
             got a shot at this.

456
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,500
             Yeah.              

457
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,900
 You know, I hate to admit it,  

458
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
    but I think it might be     
    because of you, Clavin.     

459
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,100
            What do you mean?   

460
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Well, I took all that energy    
I was gonna use to kill you,    

461
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,900
and I put it into doing         
the best job I could.           

462
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
        Oh, yeah, yeah, well,   

463
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,500
         then my secret strategy
                    worked, huh?

464
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,100
                Well, I hope you
        enjoy the car, Carla.   

465
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,100
      And, uh, just remember who
        made it all possible.   

466
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,100
             EMCEE:             
    If the contestants          
     will please be seated.     

467
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
    we have a winner.           

468
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,700
Oh, it's me, it's me,           
it's me, I feel it!             

469
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,700
 The proud owner of a brand-new 
    1991 convertible,           

470
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,400
and our new Miss Boston Barmaid 
             is...              

471
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
      Miss Shawnee Wilson!      

472
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,000
But she spilled all the drinks. 

473
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
    Who cares? Look at her.     

474
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,500
                I won! I won!   
                          I won!

475
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,300
      I won! I won! I won!      

476
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,900
        No, no, you won!        

477
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,300
         I won! I won!          
             I won!             

478
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,200
      And let's not forget      
  our Miss Congeniality award.  

479
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,100
  It goes to contestant number  
    one, Cheers' own Carla.     

480
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
That's quite a big trophy, miss.

481
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,100
  I hope you have room for it.  

482
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,800
        I'll make room.         

483
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,600
          Mr. Mailman!          

484
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,200
                Oh, look out!   

485
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,500
                I'm so happy you
            won that contest.   

486
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,300
         You know, it just shows

487
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,900
                  that the world
              hasn't gone crazy.

488
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,800
                 That, you know,
              deep, deep inside,

489
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,600
      people are basically good.

490
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,000
            That they can see   
            through the rules   
            and the regulations,

491
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,700
          you know, and pick out
              the inner diamond.

492
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,500
I won the shiny red car.        

493
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,800
          I know you did, honey!

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,600
      Woody, where's Norm?      

495
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,900
     Is he in the bathroom?     

496
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
              No.               

497
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,400
      Is he putting money       
         in the meter?          

498
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,500
              No.               

499
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,900
Don't tell me he is actually... 

500
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
     (bang, hissing sound)      

501
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,500
             NORM:              
             Whoa!              

502
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,400
        (hissing stops)
