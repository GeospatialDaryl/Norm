1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,958
COACH lN LOVE (PART 2 )

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,235
You got any fresh coffee? Great.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,593
Carla, l hate to criticise,

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,197
but l can't believe you actually read
these sleazy scandal sheets.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,670
Look at this. Even l'm above this.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,276
''Big Foot Stole My Wife.''

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,238
''Have Aliens Taken Over Your Pet?''

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,356
This is garbage!

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,312
For your information,
l don't read those articles.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,630
l think they're just as stupid as you do.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,759
l get it because they happen to have
a great crossword puzzle.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,550
OK, let's see. Seven across.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,870
Five-headed cow born in Vermont.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,752
Maybelle.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,948
1 6 across.
State with the most UFO babies.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,711
- Arkansas.
- l don't believe it.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,715
32 across. The aphrodisiac
found in every kitchen cabinet.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,636
l don't know what that one is.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,954
Let me see what 1 4 down is.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,795
Where Franco's brain
is being kept alive.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,076
Fish tank.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,637
OK, so, the fifth letter
of the aphrodisiac is an A.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,031
Now l remember. Oregano.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,352
Trash.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,918
Hi, sweetheart.
Don't look at me like that.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,799
l know we haven't spent
much time together,

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,589
but a lot's been happening
down at Cheers. Let me grab a beer.

28
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,150
lrene Blanchard
walks into the bar a few weeks ago.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,550
Coach falls for her like a ton of bricks.

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,359
Like when we first laid eyes
on each other.

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,230
He's taking her out on the town
and they've seen each other every night.

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,029
So it wasn't unexpected
when Coach comes in tonight...

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,751
Hey, l saw that yawn.
Well, l can finish this story tomorrow.

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,559
Come on, let's you and me turn in.

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,190
No! You'll wake up Vera.

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,239
- Norm?
- Be right up, dear.

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,758
You stupid dog. l hope she's not
in the mood to talk...or anything.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,833
- Antony, everything under control?
- You think the place would be on fire?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,596
l was worried, this being your first time
watching the kids alone.

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,958
- Yeah, l know, but it was no sweat.
- That's my little man. Yuck.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,834
lt feels good to get off my feet.
Where are the kids?

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,468
- Locked in the hall closet.
- Let them out!

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,871
- Sure, Ma.
- l didn't say now.

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,237
Would you like
another piece of pie, Cliffie?

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,393
l shouldn't, but l can't resist
your gooseberry pie, Mom.

46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,509
Wipe your chin. That's a good boy. Did
you have a nice time tonight at Cheers?

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,559
- Yeah, it was OK.
- Did you meet any young ladies?

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,272
No, but there was some excitement.
l told you about the Coach and lrene?

49
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,513
Tonight he asked her to marry him
and she said yeah.

50
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,753
Then she gets a call from her daughter
and lrene's won the lottery.

51
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,354
- Two million smackers.
- Good Lord.

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,476
We're kind of worried, though.

53
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,154
She forgot about
Coach when she won that dough.

54
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,311
Maybe it'll work out.

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,029
When are you taking me to Cheers
to meet your friends?

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,760
- When hell freezes over.
- What?

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,070
When the front seat of the car is fixed.

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,559
Fine.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,194
- Hello.
- What are you wearing?

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,794
- Frasier.
- l'm not Frasier.

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,997
l'm not wearing anything.
Does that excite you?

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,754
Frasier, l know it's you. lt's very late.

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,674
- You always know it's me.
- You always do the same thing.

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,831
l just called to say l love you.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,754
You're the most thoughtful boyfriend
l've ever had.

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,876
That's not saying much.

67
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,395
Speaking of Sam... This is good.

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,109
The woman Coach has been seeing,
lrene, has a daughter, Sue.

69
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,115
When they came in, Sam offered to pick
up Sue so Coach would be with lrene.

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
But she turned him down flat.

71
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,108
The best thing is it's been bugging Sam.
Then tonight she did it again.

72
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,635
l hate to admit it, but l'm enjoying it.

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,315
You little devil.
My dearest, l will bid you good night.

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,792
By the way l really don't have any
clothes on. This phone booth is freezing.

75
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,918
Good night, Frasier, darling.
Sweet dreams.

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,192
Good Lord, aren't all the eight-year-olds
in bed by now?

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,351
Good, some late news.

78
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,958
Let's see what's on the old tube here.

79
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,432
l watched some news over the weekend.
That's good enough, l guess.

80
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,829
Great! l love this one! They're doctors!

81
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,512
Found something else of yours
lying around my place.

82
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,471
- Remember this?
- Good Lord.

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,875
- For wearing or signalling aircraft?
- This is your teddy, isn't it?

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,068
l don't know which of your mindless
bimbi left that in your apartment.

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,234
lf she paid money for it, she should be
seen to and chemically altered.

86
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,713
- You don't like the colour?
- What made you think that was mine?

87
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,714
You're the only person l know that
shops at those fancy French places.

88
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,679
The House of Ooh La La.

89
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,149
Get it away from me. lt's horrendous.

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,991
This is lovely.

91
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,235
- Do you want it?
- Me? l can't take this, Sam.

92
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,756
- Please, go ahead.
- God, thanks.

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,076
From the House of Ooh La La!

94
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,232
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,391
Tell us what you know, Norm.

96
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,633
God's in his heaven and something,
something, something.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,598
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, that's it.

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,993
Your Florida tan is far deeper, far richer,
than your ordinary run-of-the-mill tan.

99
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,119
l've got a patch over here.
l'll show you the distinction.

100
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,398
l see Cliff found somebody he hasn't
bored to death with his Florida spiel yet.

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,677
Marco Polo didn't talk
about his trip this much.

102
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,037
- You see how the rayon sock...
- Gee, it's seven o'clock!

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,350
You wonder where the evening's gone.

104
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,432
- l'll remember where l was.
- So will l.

105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,111
Nice guy.

106
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,795
- So, where's the Coach?
- He's in the back working.

107
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,157
l understand lrene
postponed the wedding again.

108
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,596
- What does that make? Three times.
- A Stoly rocks, Sam.

109
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,036
He hasn't seen much of her since
she became Miss Moneybags.

110
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,794
Woman! They're only good for one thing.

111
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,633
And for you, not even that.

112
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,076
l'm kind of worried.
This doesn't seem to faze Coach.

113
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,549
He's going on like nothing happened.

114
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,872
- lt's like he's got his head in the sand.
- Did my fiancÃ©e call, Sam?

115
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,113
- No, Coach, not today.
- When she does, l'll be in the back.

116
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,794
Hey, Coach, wait a second here.

117
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,076
Let me have a little talk with you.

118
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,954
Everything's all right with you and lrene?

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,190
Yeah, sure, never better.

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,670
l hear she changed the wedding date
again. What's the story?

121
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,278
- lt's just nerves, Sam. lt's only natural.
- But you've hardly seen her lately.

122
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,592
Well, she's been making all these
wedding plans. l'm not worried about it.

123
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,957
Coach, she moved
and she didn't tell you where.

124
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,629
Well, l am a little worried about that,

125
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,598
but with all the excitement,
she probably forgot.

126
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,830
Coach, listen to me.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,549
l'm going to tell you straight
and you'd better listen to me.

128
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,918
Before you do, could l ask
a very special favour of you?

129
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,117
- What?
- Would you please be my best man?

130
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,158
Coach, sure. l'd be proud to.

131
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,914
Thanks, Sam.

132
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,469
Now if l can just clear this with lrene.

133
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,111
- What does she care?
- No, it's not lrene. lt's Sue.

134
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,070
lf you showed up at the wedding, she
said something about hiring a sniper.

135
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,998
She can't stop thinking about me.

136
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,517
Obviously, little Miss Sue
has a bad case of Sammy-itis.

137
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,070
Sometimes known as the swine flu.

138
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,798
Sam, admit it. The poor woman had
a low threshold for overbearing bores.

139
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,988
l got an idea. Maybe l could send her
a relief map of my body.

140
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,233
Or you could send her
a life-sized portrait of your brain.

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,914
l know a good miniaturist.

142
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,230
No, that's not sexy enough.

143
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,036
Hi, everyone.

144
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,596
ls Ernie here? l'd like to talk to him.

145
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,910
He'll be honoured
you remember his name.

146
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,277
Carla, come on. Stay out of this.

147
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,396
Somebody here to see you!

148
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,835
- ls it lrene?
- Yeah, it is.

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,869
l haven't seen you since proposing.
How are the wedding plans going?

150
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,273
- That's what l want to talk about, Ernie.
- Did you want to move the date up?

151
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,228
- Ernie, would you please sit down?
- Sure, come on.

152
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,873
- Do you know where l was tonight?
- Probably at home, wherever that is.

153
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,838
l went to the Governor's mansion
for dinner.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,956
Holy mackerel!

155
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,237
l guess you didn't think l'd want to go.

156
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,952
The point is, since l won that money,
l've been meeting new people.

157
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,352
Experiencing new things.
And there's a lot more l still want to do.

158
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,229
l'm talking about Paris, Monaco, London.

159
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,032
- l'd be perfectly happy with Six Flags.
- l know you would.

160
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,116
Ernie, this is really...
This is very hard for me.

161
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,708
l wouldn't want to hurt you for the world,

162
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,476
but the plain truth is l'm not the same
person l was three weeks ago.

163
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,757
That person loved you.

164
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,033
You're a good man,
but l've been married to a good man.

165
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,958
l've never been obscenely wealthy.
Money changes people, Ernie.

166
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,113
lt hasn't changed me.
l'm engaged to a very wealthy woman,

167
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,592
but l'm still the same simple guy
l always was.

168
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,114
Ernie, l don't think
we're engaged any more.

169
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,515
l'm sorry.

170
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,756
l hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

171
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,029
There's nothing to forgive.
This isn't you talking, it's the money.

172
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,357
You've got to get this out of your system
and you'll come back to me.

173
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,511
- l wish l could make you understand.
- Look, we set a wedding date, right?

174
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,636
That date is still set.

175
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,110
When that date comes,
l'll be waiting for you.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,991
Goodbye, Ernie.

177
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,156
Have a wonderful life.

178
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,350
You're crazy. This isn't goodbye.

179
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,114
- Yes, it is.
- lt isn't.

180
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,874
lt is.

181
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,710
She's going to make one hell of a wife,
ain't she? lsn't it romantic?

182
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,914
Yeah, that's what l like.
A nice clean break.

183
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,309
Coach, pretty spiffy there.
What's the occasion?

184
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,994
My wedding day. Some cologne, please.

185
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,515
- You heard from lrene?
- Not for a while.

186
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,150
But you're not supposed
to see the bride before the ceremony.

187
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,518
No, but you're supposed to know
whether or not she's in the country.

188
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,310
Sam, will you stop worrying about
every little thing, like countries?

189
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,392
- All right.
- This is a very happy day.

190
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,596
Folks...

191
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,519
Folks, l have an apology to make.

192
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,953
A lot of you
can't be invited to the wedding

193
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,237
because it's going to be
a small private affair.

194
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,439
- Sorry some of you had to be left out.
- Like the bride.

195
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,636
That really hurts.

196
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,596
Then l haven't lived in vain.

197
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,709
Diane, l'm sorry, but you can't sing
at the wedding like you offered to.

198
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,036
l understand.

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,159
Just standing there looking geeky
will be entertainment enough.

200
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,154
Sam, l'm going to check
on my honeymoon reservation.

201
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,389
The Coach is headed for Dump City.
He's got his pedal to the metal.

202
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,155
l still say
there's something touching about it.

203
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,313
A man with that much hope and faith
in a relationship is very rare.

204
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,153
So's the oxygen to your brain.

205
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,269
You're not helping him saying stuff like
that. We've got to get him to face reality.

206
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,194
Diane, you of all people
should realise how painful it is

207
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,875
to love somebody
who doesn't love you back.

208
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,518
Yes, your sobbing, your whimpering,

209
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,797
your moony-eyed sighs
have not gone unnoticed.

210
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,192
You must have dreamt that about me.
So the dreams about me continue?

211
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,794
Still have the one about the white horse?

212
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,110
One end of it.

213
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,159
Sam, the day l met Frasier Crane,
l stopped looking for Mr Right.

214
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,834
That would discourage me, too.

215
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,992
Why don't you two hit each other
in the face or shut up?

216
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,118
- We're trying to deal with the Coach.
- You're right.

217
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,875
But is it wrong for a man to believe
the woman he loves will come back?

218
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,918
Yes,
when the chances that she will are none.

219
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,277
l'm sure if lrene knew
how strongly the Coach still felt,

220
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,716
she'd make an effort to talk to him
and straighten him out.

221
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,394
We don't know how
to get in touch with her.

222
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,235
But l know how to get in touch
with her daughter, Miss Frost bottom.

223
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,073
l'll give her a message
to pass on to her mother

224
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,676
and she can keep a little of it for herself.

225
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,876
A message about how
a couple of women

226
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,669
that don't know the first thing
about being decent to folks...

227
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,319
Hi, Babe, Sam Malone. Busy tonight?

228
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,472
For the rest of your life.
l thought that's what you'd say,

229
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,710
but before you hang up on me here,

230
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,553
this doesn't have anything
to do with you.

231
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,713
lt's about your mother and the way
she's treated the Coach. lt stinks.

232
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,553
l don't want to say
how enraged l am over the phone,

233
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,234
so how about dinner tonight?

234
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,233
l knew you would say that, but listen up.

235
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,437
l don't want to go to dinner.
l already ate.

236
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,916
So, how about a drink?

237
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,516
l knew you would say that, too,
but l got news. l don't drink.

238
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,638
So who feels stupid now?

239
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,276
You agree with me?

240
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,675
You should be ashamed of your mother,
Sue. What's going on here?

241
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,115
Corfu?

242
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,074
Yeah, thanks. l'm beginning to hate
the women in that family.

243
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,196
What is it?

244
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,117
lrene's engaged to another man, some
hotshot foreign industrialist millionaire.

245
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,475
Said his name was Glods or something.

246
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,757
Stanislaw Glods? What a catch.

247
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,072
Anyway, she's living with him in Corfu,
wherever the hell that is.

248
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,312
Corfu. Poor man's Pensacola.

249
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,037
- Here he comes.
- Don't anybody say anything.

250
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,714
- Any calls?
- No, Coach.

251
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,876
- You mean lrene didn't call?
- l don't think lrene's going to call...ever.

252
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,157
Sam, you're so young.

253
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,757
Hey, Coach,
she's engaged to another man.

254
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,912
l just spoke to her daughter.
Some rich European guy.

255
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,871
Heavens to Betsy! l've been left
at the altar! What shall l do?

256
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,874
Coach, will you wake up
and smell the coffee?

257
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,477
- Take it easy, will you?
- Coach, l'm sorry.

258
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,353
l didn't mean to yell at you.
Forgive me.

259
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,556
lt's OK, honey.

260
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,271
Up until a few moments ago, l, too,
was a holdout for a happy ending.

261
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,391
But even this seemingly incontrovertible
evidence hasn't shaken your faith a fig.

262
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,071
- How can you be so certain?
- Right here, Diane.

263
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,754
The heart, who knows how it works?

264
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,357
lt's essentially an involuntary muscle,
activated by electrical impulses...

265
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,750
Exactly! No one!

266
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,115
lt works by feelings, Diane.

267
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,990
All my feelings tell me that she'll be back.
You understand?

268
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,789
She'll be back here before closing time.

269
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,871
Nothing's sadder than a man
holding on to a dead dream.

270
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,873
Unless it's a blonde
struggling to keep her hopes up.

271
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,192
No, l think it's a tall ex-baseball player
who clings for...

272
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,070
How about the three of us go out
and get something to eat, like old times?

273
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,189
l thought l knew her.
l was so sure she'd come back today.

274
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,197
Maybe she had a family crisis,
like her daughter fell off her broomstick.

275
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,915
How about a pizza? You love pizza.

276
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,834
No, l don't.
You can't crawl in bed with a pizza.

277
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,959
Well, maybe you could,
but a pizza can't keep you warm.

278
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,352
Maybe it could, but you can't kiss
a pizza. Your lips would get...

279
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,159
Coach, we get the point.

280
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,670
- You know what really hurts the most?
- What?

281
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,518
l thought up to the last moment she'd
call. How could l have been so wrong?

282
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,996
You wanted it to happen so badly
you never thought it wouldn't.

283
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,278
No, Diane. l never doubted it.
l thought we'd get together.

284
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,670
But l guess the money did change her.

285
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,996
l guess it did.

286
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,150
You want to know something?

287
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,676
l'm wondering if we would have made
that good a couple.

288
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,956
Come on, let's get some pizza.

289
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,034
Boy, life with her sure ain't boring.

290
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,470
Coach, don't answer that phone.

291
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,838
We both know that it's lrene,
but why not teach her a lesson?

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,276
No, Diane.
lf she was thoughtful enough to call...

293
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,553
Look, honey, let me do the talking.

294
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,518
lf l hear your voice,
l may change my mind.

295
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,639
You're better off with the rich guy.
l realise that even if you don't.

296
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,237
Now, look, we had some good times,
just take care of yourself.

297
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,509
l hope she understands.

298
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,115
Coach, wait a second here. Did you
actually hear her voice on the phone?

299
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,317
l didn't have to, Sam. lt was her.

300
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,828
- So it's all over?
- Well, it's all over for me.

301
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,275
l still feel sorry for her.

302
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,751
Poor kid.

303
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,751
lt's her.

304
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,475
