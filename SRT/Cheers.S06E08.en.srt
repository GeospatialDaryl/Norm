                CARLA:          
                Woody, here's   
                your dinner.    

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,074
    Oh, thanks, Carla.          

4
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:12,443
Boy, I'm going to be glad       
when I drop this double load.   

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:16,314
My veins are killing me.        

6
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:17,649
                Your veins, huh?

7
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,417
Yeah, varicose veins.           

8
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,353
I had them stripped             
twice already.                  

9
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:23,538
            How do they do that?

10
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:24,639
Surgically.                     

11
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:25,874
They cut a hole                 

12
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:30,344
in your leg,                    
and they pull the vein out.     

13
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,646
                     No kidding?

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,083
Yeah, it's like pulling         
a long, slimy worm              

15
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:37,952
out of you flesh.               

16
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,822
              Gee, imagine that.

17
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,508
  Can you believe maintaining   
that postcoital tristesse       

18
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,109
      is gender oriented.       

19
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:46,845
         Do you mind, Dr. Crane?

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,279
              I'm trying to eat.

 Takes everything you've got

00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,662
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

25
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,765
 Sure would help a lot         

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,071
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

27
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:15,873
   Sometimes you want to go    

28
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:20,795
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

29
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:26,033
 And they're always glad       
        you came               

30
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:28,035
         You want to be

         Woody, does it look    
         like we're going to get

38
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:07,475
                a good turnout  
                for our auction?

39
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,642
Oh, yeah.                       

40
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:10,511
I'll bet by now                 
there isn't anyone in Boston    

41
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:11,779
who doesn't know about it.

We're having an auction?        

43
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,685
         It's terrific.         

44
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,387
It's a benefit                  
for Children's Hospital.        

45
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:20,855
All these women                 
get together                    

46
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,890
          and they bid          
for an evening on the town      

47
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:24,225
    with eligible bachelors.    

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,361
Local celebrities,              
athletes.                       

49
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:27,995
They raise a lot of money,      
     they do it every year,     

50
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,197
 and it's a great deal of fun.  

51
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,365
Where'd you hear about it?      

52
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,900
 I must have been to one once.  

53
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,369
Anyway,                         
I told Mr. Drake...             

54
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,102
Who'd you bid on?               

55
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,322
        I told Mr. Drake        

56
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,024
        I thought               
  it would be great publicity   

57
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,358
for Cheers.                     
        Who'd you bid on?       

58
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,194
And since it's for a good cause,
          he agreed...          

59
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,029
Who'd you bid on?               

60
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,196
      A hairy linebacker.       

61
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,331
    Are you satisfied?          

62
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:47,698
    Ooh.                        
            Oh!                 

63
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,634
        Were you?

         The point is,          

66
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,955
        Mr. Drake               
thinks it's a great idea.

00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:59,494
So, Sammy, you going to be      
  taking part in this auction?  

69
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,828
      Are you kidding me?       

70
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,196
    I hate that stuff.          

71
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,048
         It's one thing         

72
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,800
            for guys            
    to bid on chicks, but...    

73
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,602
          that's sick.          

74
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,872
You know, as a matter of fact...

75
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:12,940
          Here you go.          

76
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,108
                Excuse me.      

77
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:16,344
    Listen, I'm going to save   
    you the embarrassment       

78
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,112
              of asking and then
              being turned down.

79
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,980
             I'm not going to be
             doing your auction.

80
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,749
                  So just forget
                  it. No way.   

81
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:22,883
                         Not me.

82
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,085
    Fine.                       

83
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,120
We need to create               
a stage.                        

84
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,322
I think right there             

85
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:28,556
as you walk in the door...      

86
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,225
              Hey, what's "fine"
              supposed to mean? 

87
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:33,160
Well, it means I hadn't planned 
to ask you in the first place.  

88
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:34,362
        Oh, well, good, good.   

89
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:36,797
        'Cause I really don't   
        care for that stuff.    

90
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,798
    All right.                  

91
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,634
We need a podium.               

92
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:40,768
Because the emcee               
is going to be                  

93
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:41,836
    standing at the podium,     

94
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,170
    and all the women           
will be standing around...      

95
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,472
                 Excuse me, one 
                 more time here.

96
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,473
                        Why...  

97
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,808
          why hadn't you planned
          on asking me?         

98
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:49,510
         Well, I guess          
     I just don't find you      

99
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,512
  as irresistible as some do.   

100
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,014
    You, for instance.          

101
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,017
But if you want to participate, 
you're perfectly welcome...     

102
00:03:57,052 --> 00:03:58,519
             No, hey, forget it.

103
00:03:58,554 --> 00:03:59,621
                      I'm sorry.

104
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,389
    It doesn't matter to me     
          either way.           

105
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:03,825
      I'm only doing this       
          for charity.          

106
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,094
        You know, Vera has that 
        carved on our headboard.

107
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:10,998
  So we're agreed then, right?  

108
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,967
             Just plain simple  
             gold wedding bands.

109
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,136
With an exquisite               
marquise diamond on mine        

110
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,471
so we can                       
tell them apart.                

111
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,806
          You give me such glee.

112
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,973
                    Here we are.

113
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,308
         Sit here, my betrothed.

114
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,810
             I'll go get us     
             something to drink,

115
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,278
        and, oh, uh, exchange   
        a few lies with my buds.

116
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:25,346
I understand.                   

117
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,081
Your daily dose                 
of male bonding.                

118
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,583
                Well, not for   
                much longer.    

119
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:31,319
    You know what's are breaking
    up that old gang of mine.   

120
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:34,755
      As a guess, I'd say       
  hypertension and cirrhosis.   

121
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,310
     You're irrepressible.      

122

    Sam, champagne, please.     

123

    Ah, guys.                   

124
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,153
    Norm, Cliff.                

125
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,121
    Won't be long now           
before the boys of the bar      

126
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,923
  are going to have to manage   
          without me.           

127
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,324
Can do.                         

128
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,126
        Yeah, no sweat, Fras.   

129
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,298
                 Champagne, huh?

130
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:02,466
Well, wild romance              
is a fictive term               

131
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,634
with no correlation             

132
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,870
to any actual                   
physiological behavior.         

133
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,306
We, nevertheless,               
like to humor convention        

134
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,342
by going through                
with these preposterous rituals.

135
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,880
                 Champagne, huh?

136
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,484
Hey, Frasier,                   
can I ask you something?        

137
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,270
When you and Lilith             
wake up in the morning,         

138
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,971
which one of you                
is the first to scream,         

139
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,440
"What have I done?"             

140
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,830
            Well, my darling,   

141
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:33,631
                    to us.      

142
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,182
Thank you, darling.             

143
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:39,153
It's been a lovely evening.     

144
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:42,323
You've revealed                 
previously unsuspected depths   

145
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,591
of romanticism.                 

146
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,992
        Well, Lilith, we have   
        a whole lifetime        

147
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,327
            of romantic evenings
            ahead of us,        

148
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,495
              but for now,      
              we've got to plan.

149
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,730
        We don't have much time.

150
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,598
            We've got to get    
            the wedding license,

151
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:52,233
            have blood tests,   
            see the lawyer      

152
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,901
        draw up the             
        prenuptial agreement,   

153
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,169
            invite the guests...

154
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:56,237
        Excuse me.              

155
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,207
What prenuptial agreement?      

156
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:03,277
  Well, wherein we decide what  
 you are or are not entitled to 

157
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,611
     in event of a divorce.     

158
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:05,746
    It's merely a safeguard.    

159
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,999
         You're already         
planning for the divorce?       

160
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,652
    Have you selected           
     my cemetery plot also?     

161
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:12,620
Well, assuming we stay together,

162
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,222
you'll be right between me      
    and Cousin Lemuel.          

163
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:17,291
I cannot believe my ears.       

164
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,744
 This is your idea of romance?  

165
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,962
Lilith, man does not live       
    by romance alone.           

166
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:23,931
    He also needs hardheaded    
         practicality.          

167
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:27,034
  If your head was any harder,  
      it would etch glass.      

168
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,136
            Where are you going?

169
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,304
I have no intention             

170
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:31,606
of spending the rest            
of the evening,                 

171
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,525
let alone                       
the rest of my life,            

172
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,510
with a compulsive,              
anal retentive, chowderhead.    

173
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:38,630
          Now, Lilith,          

174
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,498
  let's just both stop right now

175
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,117
    before we say something     
    to spoil the mood.          

176
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:46,421
        Why don't you go        
 make love to your accountant.  

177
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:49,990
    You know, if more people    
     followed that advice,      

178
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,794
      this world would be       
     such a happier place.      

179
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:55,646
You know,                       
I just figured out              

180
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,981
what you're doing here.         

181
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,816
             You're using       
             reverse psychology.

182
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,486
    You really want me to be    
    in that auction of yours,   

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,920
            so you're pretending
            that you don't,     

184
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,388
                     am I right?

185

I don't care                    
if you're in the auction.

                    Yeah, right.

more honestly and passionately

00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:10,520
 I just wanted some insurance,  
            I guess.            

609
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,024
        Of course, I...         

610
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:15,993
     I forgot I'm marrying      
    the perfect woman.          

611
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:23,033
                  Don't forget  
                  that, Frasier.

612
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:27,788
      And I certainly didn't    
      mean to hurt you with Sam.

613
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:30,541
    By the way, what took       
    you so long getting here?   

614
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,543
Oh, well,                       
when I first arrived,           

615
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,211
I went to the wrong room.       

616
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,413
        Uh...                   

617
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,649
By the way,                     
we're having breakfast tomorrow 

618
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,351
with Jack and Peggy             
in number eight.                

619
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,887
    I'm paying.                 

620
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,723
              Frasier, you dear,
              sweet ninny.      

621
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:49,826
I do love you, you know.        

622
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,762
                And I, you.     

623
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:58,771
