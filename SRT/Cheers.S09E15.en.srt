      Afternoon, everyone.      

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Woody, may I have               
a beer, please?

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,300
Oh, just a second,              
Dr. Crane.

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm finishing up this article   
in <i>Newsweek</i> on genetic coding.  

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,700
Do you understand it, Woody?    

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,000
No. Thank God                   
I'm almost finished.            

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,100
                 It says here in
             <i>Scientific American</i>

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,900
    they've isolated the gene   
          that causes arthritis.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,100
What have you got there, Sam?   

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,800
    Ad for hair conditioner.    

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,700
  It says it makes your scalp   
          all tingly.           

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,300
    Oh, I'm, I'm glad to see    
that you're all making an effort

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,300
  to keep yourselves informed.  
                        Yeah,   

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,300

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,900
I was enjoying that.            

66
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.           

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,900
            Always leave them   
                wanting more.   

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,100
 Guys, listen up for a second.  

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,100
    Will you, please?           

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
    Uh, when Rebecca comes in,  

71
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,000
 she's, uh, probably not going  
    to be feeling too good,     

72
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,000
  so just take it easy on her.  

73
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,500
        All right?              

74
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
    What's the problem, Sam?    

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,100
            Well, she called off
              the whole wedding.

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Get out.                        

77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,300
SAM:                            
No, it's true.                  
I went over there last night.   

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,700
                 I tell you, she
                was a real mess,

79
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
            but she was clear   
                about one thing:

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
                    she does not
                    love the guy

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
              and there's no way
    she's going to marry him.   

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
    Good morning, everyone!     

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
             Jonathan, thank God
                    you're here.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
             I'm in such a rush.

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,700
      Now, I don't have any time
              for those curlers,

86
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,100
              so you're going to
        have to do your trick   

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
            with the blow-dryer.

88
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,000
                      Yeah, Sam,
                 she's in agony.

89
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Ordinarily, Sam, people         
don't deal with depression      

90
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,000
 by putting on a wedding dress  
    and acting giddy.           

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,800
      Except maybe Clavin.      

92
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,100
      Men don't get giddy.      

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
              Yeah, right, nice.

94
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,400
         This is crazy.         

95
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,100
      I got to go find out      
        what's happened.        

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,700
Way back on my head             
or up forward like this,        

97
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,300
whichever way we decide.        

98
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,500
         Hi, Sam.               

99
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,800
      What are you doing?       

100
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
     I know, I know.            

101
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
 I said that I would never have 
     a traditional wedding,     

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,100
         but, you know,         
    deep down inside,           

103
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,100
    doesn't every girl want     
    to get married in white?    

104
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,900
What about all that stuff       
      you said last night?      

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
          What stuff?           
 I wasn't even here last night. 

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,900
             I know             
  you weren't here last night.  

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
  You were at your apartment.   
     I was there with you.      

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,100
                    Remember?   
    Oh, don't be silly, Sam.    

109
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
     I wouldn't let anybody     
    in that apartment.          

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,200
        It's a mess.            

111
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,400
Oh, my God, she doesn't...      
  you don't remember, do you?   

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,300
                      Excuse us.
             We're working here.

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
        Dear, I'll need         
an extension cord for the dryer.

114
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Oh, sure.                       
                Hey, yo, pal.   

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,300
            Listen, I don't care
         what you're doing here.

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,100
    Th-This happens to be the   
    most important thing that...

117
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,500
            You use this gel?   

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
                 I tried this.  

119
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,600
                It just dries   
                    my hair out.

120
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,900
Are you touching it during      
the critical drying stage?      

121
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,800
            What do you think   
                 I am, a rookie?

122
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
You guys,                       
I have my new wedding dress     

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
and now all I need              
is something old,               

124
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,800
something borrowed,             
and something blue.             

125
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,600
    How about Norm's liver?     

126
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
                     I <i>am</i> almost
            finished with it.   

127
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,100
                    Uh, Rebecca,

128
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,300
I'm probably way out            
of line here, but, uh...        

129
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,100
              I want you to know
              what a great honor

130
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,800
 it would be for me             
 to sing at your wedding.       

131
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,500
             Okay.              

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
                  Really? Cool! 

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Jonathan,                       
I found the extension cord.     

134
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,800
      We'll have to finish      
    down at City Hall.          

135
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,100
                            SAM:
                     Honey, now,
                  wait a minute.

136
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,300
We were in your apartment       
        together.               

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,200
      Don't you remember?       
    You came on to me.          

138
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,700
      You said that you couldn't
            possibly marry Robin

139
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
  because in your entire life   

140
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,100
      you never had anyone      
    as exciting as me.          

141
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,200
My! Someone's full              
of himself                      

142
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,400
on my wedding day.              

143
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
              Well, Sam, don't  
             just stand there.  

144
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,600
Yeah, you're right;             
I got to find something         

145
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,900
    to jog her memory.          
                         No, no,

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,600
          you got to help me get
        this machine in the car.

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
                 I've got a gig.

148
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
         Test, testing.         

149
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,400
        One, two.               

150
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
    A-one, two, three, four.    

151
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,000
      ¶ Chong-ka-ka-chong-      
      ka-chong-ka-chong. ¶      

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,300
  We're going to <i>cook</i> tonight.  

153
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello, Doc.                     

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,100
          Yeah, boy, City Hall--

155
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,700
        the civil servant's home
                 away from home.

156
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
    Yeah, you know, whenever    
    the job gets me down, Norm, 

157
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
    I just come around here     
        and roam the halls.     

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,600
 Hey, pal, I thought we told you
        never to come back here.

159
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,100
            How many times we   
        got to throw you out?   

160
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
 Look, I-I'm with the wedding.  

161
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,200
    Is that true, sir?          

162
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,500
Uh, yes, yeah, yeah, it is...   
but, uh, stick around.          

163
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
        (panting):              
  Oh, great, I'm not too late.  

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,500
        Where's Rebecca?        

165
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,400
        She's in there.         

166
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,600
     What's all this junk?      

167
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh, this is, uh,                

168
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
         just some of her stuff.

169
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
                    I broke into
                  her apartment.

170
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,000
And you passed up               
her stereo equipment for this?  

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Stay a bartender, Sam.          

172
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
                     No, no, no.

173
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
      No, I'm just hoping       
      when she sees this--      

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,300
    you know, smells the pizza--

175
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,900
that it'll help bring back      
  her memory about last night.  

176
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,000
     Hey... honey, Rebecca?     

177
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,700
     Hi.                        
        Sam, isn't that mine?   

178
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,300
Yeah, you bet it is.            

179
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,700
Here, open the pizza box.       

180
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Look at that, huh?              

181
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,500
Some pizza with Canadian bacon  
and pineapple and...            

182
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,800
look at your robe here with     
Canadian bacon and pineapple.   

183
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
      Huh?                      

184
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,300
Now, does this all              
remind you of something?        

185
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
                      (gasping):
            Oh, God, oh, God,   
              I just remembered!

186
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,700
Oh, yes!                        

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,900
Oh, God, thank you!             

188
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Th... I thought                 
I was going crazy.              

189
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
        Yes, I remembered I left
            my garter in my car.

190
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
                Would you get it
                 for me, please?

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
    Well, sure, but...          

192
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,800
          (blubbering)          

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,700
I don't know why people get     
so nutty during weddings.       

194
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,100
Hey, compared to some           
cultures, we got it easy.       

195
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Take the Wanobis                
in Central Africa.              

196
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,800
Now, there's a ceremony.        

197
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,800
See, they get                   
the lovebirds                   

198
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,800
and smear them with a mixture   
of honey and sweet oil.         

199
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Then it's off                   
to the anthill.                 

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,300
  Uh, this man's bothering me.  

201
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
        We're talking...        

202
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
              Why don't you come
                with me, pal?   

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
We're going to that             
little room downstairs?         

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
                 Yes, yes.      

205
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, Rebecca, this is...        
wow, nice hair.                 

206
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
      I brought you some samples
            I had in the car.   

207
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,100
    Oh, yeah, thanks.           

208
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
Give us a yoo-hoo               
if you like them.               

209
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,600
        Honey.                  

210
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,100
Honey...                        
         Sam, where's my garter?

211
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Oh, I sent Woody                
after it.                       

212
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Listen, sweetheart, we've been  
friends for a long time, right? 

213
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,500
                        Right.  
I hope you understand           
that what I'm doing,            

214
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm doing for you.              

215
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,300
I'm doing it out of our,        

216
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,000
our friendship                  
over the last four years.       

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm doing it                    
because I care.                 

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,500
            Okay, Sam, go ahead.

219
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,400
Snap out of it,                 
will you?!                      

220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Let the fog lift here!          

221
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,500
You said that you               
didn't love the guy!            

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,300
 What the hell are you doing?!  

223
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,100
(knocking)                      

224
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Uh, Miss Howe, I couldn't find  
your garter in your car,        

225
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,800
but I did find                  
these jumper cables.            

226
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
          Woody, what am I going
            to do with these?   

227
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,200
    Well, they may not look     
        so great,               

228
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
but they, they'll probably      
    hold up your stockings.     

229
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,800
        Of course,              
    they might leave a mark.    

230
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,400
 Great, and what am I supposed  
to do after the ceremony?       

231
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,700
    Throw a tire iron           
      to the bridesmaids?       

232
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,500
 All right, I'll be right back. 

233
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,400
SAM:                            
Oh, hell, I give up.            

234
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,900
  You know, do what you want.   
          Marry Robin.          

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,700
I hope you'll be very happy,    
waking up every morning to...   

236
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,200
    (imitating Robin):          
  ..."Good morning, Rebecca."   

237
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,300
Good morning, Rebecca.          

238
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,700
     (chuckles)                 

239
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,900
Darling,                        
I know it's bad luck            

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,500
to see the bride                
before the wedding, but,        

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,800
well, I've, uh, lost my fortune;
I've been to prison.            

242
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,500
What more could happen to me?   

243
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,200
You know, I can't keep this     
a secret any longer.            

244
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
Do you remember                 
the day we first made love      

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,300
and I surprised you             
by flying in                    

246
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Bill Medley of the Righteous    
Brothers to sing for you?       

247
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,300
                 Of course I do.

248
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,400
            That was a wonderful
                 present, Robin.

249
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,300
Well, I thought                 
it would be sweet               

250
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
if, uh, I could find some way   
to relive that memory           

251
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,400
on our wedding day, and now     
that I'm finally unchained...   

252
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,800
¶ Oh... my love                 

253
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,200
        (gasping)               

254
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,400
     ¶ My darlin' ¶             

255
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,700
¶ I've hungered                 
for your touch... ¶             

256
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,500
                         My God!

257
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,700
         It's the other         
    Righteous Brother!          

258
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,300
                 Bobby Hatfield.

259
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,400
    Oh, no, no, to me           

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
he'll always be the other       
    Righteous Brother.          

261
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
¶ ...so slowly...               
 I'm, uh, ready to start.       

262
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,800
¶ And time...                   

263
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,200
    Who's this bozo?            

264
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm Bobby Hatfield.             

265
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,900
             Yes, Robin gave him
             to me as a present.

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
              He's going to sing
                  at my wedding.

267
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,700
        Isn't that wonderful?   

268
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,300
                        Oh.     

269
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
                      So he's in
                    and I'm out?

270
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,100
                Well, fine.     

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,100
                Instead of my   
          personal gift of song,

272
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,400
             I'll just get you a
            set of steak knives.

273
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,700
              So you can cut out
                 my heart again.

274
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,100
Young man, would you make sure  
everyone gets seated?           

275
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
        Oh, yes, Father.        

276
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm not a priest.               

277
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,700
I'm a government official.      

278
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
      Oh. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

279
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,400
No, son, that would be a judge. 

280
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
    I'm a Justice               
    of the Peace.               

281
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
                Well, then, what
              should I call you?

282
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
You can call me Ed.             

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
             Well, it looks like

284
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,500
         I... I won't be singing
                      after all.

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,400
                 But Rebecca has
        graciously invited me   

286
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
             to push the buttons
         for Mr. Bobby Hatfield.

287
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,800
                      Let's see.

288
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,300
                  What number is
             "Unchained Melody?"

289
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
             U-14.              

290
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
                    Yes, master.

291
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,000
("Unchained Melody" plays)      

292
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,700
        ¶ Oh, my love           

293
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,400
         ¶ My darling           

294
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,800
That's a lovely song.           

295
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,100
          ¶ I hunger            

296
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,900
            That's because we're
        close to the speaker.   

297
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,400
     ¶ For your touch...        

298
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,200
Every time I hear that song,    

299
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,800
it reminds me of the first time 
we saw <i>Ghost.</i>                   

300
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,300
Hey, Lilith, songs do make you  
remember things, right?         

301
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,500
Oh, most definitely.            

302
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
      Music is perhaps one      
     of the most evocative      

303
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
    of the associative          
            stimuli.            

304
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
          ¶ And I...            

305
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,300
Some fascinating data-gathering 
was done in 1957                

306
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
                    in Brussels,
                     when the...

307
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
        ¶ So slowly...          

308
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,700
They always leave when I get    
to the interesting part.        

309
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
        ¶ And time...           

310
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,100
(instrumental intro plays       
    for "We've Got Tonight")    

311
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
It's okay.                      

312
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,500
It's her other                  
favorite song.                  

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,400
¶ We've got tonight... ¶        

314
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,300
            She sang it to me   
                just last night.

315
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,600
             BOBBY:             
    ¶ Who needs tomorrow?       

316
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,200
  ¶ Let's make it last, babe ¶  

317
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,500
      ¶ Let's find a way ¶      

318
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,300
             I know             
  I've heard this song before.  

319
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,900
    ¶ Turn out the lights       

320
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,100
  I just can't remember when.   

321
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,900
  ¶ Come on and hold my hand    

322
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
    It seems like it was...     

323
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,400
¶ We got tonight, honey         
            Oh, God!            

324
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,700
    ¶ Why don't you stay? ¶     

325
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,100
    ¶ Why don't you stay? ¶     

326
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,700
¶ Turn out the light...         

327
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,200
                Rebecca, this   
                    is insanity!

328
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,600
                  Open the door!

329
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Is she ready to go on           
with the ceremony?              

330
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
We're on a very tight           
schedule here.                  

331
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,300
I have fishing licenses         
to pass out.                    

332
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,900
     Uh, well, there's got to be
      another key someplace, Ed.

333
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,300
  Second floor.                 

334
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,700
        Security.               

335
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
            Oh. You know, I just
          don't understand this.

336
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,400
             She's always seemed
            so stable before.   

337
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
                Did you two ever
                    really talk?

338
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,500
    Hey, guy, what's, uh...     
        what's going on?        

339
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,700
Did I miss much?                

340
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,900
            Uh, no, not much.   

341
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,900
          Looks like the wedding
                might be off.   

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
What are you talking about?     

343
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
After I spent all that time     
tying tin cans                  

344
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,800
to the back of Robin's car      

345
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,500
and spraying it                 
with shaving cream,             

346
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
tying toilet paper to it?       

347
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
                Robin doesn't   
                     have a car.

348
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh.                             

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
It just irritates me.           

350
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,200
I mean, I was all ready         
to sing at this wedding,        

351
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
            and then you walk   
                    in the door.

352
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,300
         Well, naturally, you're
              the better singer.

353
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
          You're a professional.

354
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,300
     Well, I'd be willing to bet

355
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
 that I'm a better psychiatrist 
         than you are.          

356
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,600
Really?                         

357
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Uh, how long                    
have you felt this way?         

358
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,100
                Then again, I   
                 could be wrong.

359
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Boy, I could sure go            
for a taste of this cake.       

360
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,900
      We really don't need      
 this congratulations anymore.  

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,500
No.                             

362
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
    Not if they're not          
        getting married.        
                            Hey.

363
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,800
  Wow, we've really kind of made
a mess of this top part here.   

364
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
    CARLA:                      
    Yeah.                       
             Yeah.              

365
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,400
Yeah, well, we'll just take out 
        the whole layer.        

366
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,200
                     Okay.      
            CARLA:              
            Yeah!               

367
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,900
Are you ready to go on          
with the ceremony?              

368
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,000
                    No. Not yet.

369
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,200
                  I need to work
            a few things out.   

370
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,900
            I-I need somebody   
                     to talk to.

371
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,100
                        Anybody.

372
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,400
                 I-I... I really
                 need some help!

373
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
    (crowd murmuring)           

374
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
                        REBECCA:
                    Not Paul!   

375
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
     I can't help somebody      
 who doesn't want to be helped. 

376
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
You okay, honey?                

377
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
                 No. I need time
                    to think.   

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
         I have to talk         
    to somebody about this.     

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,300
  I-I need to talk to somebody  

380
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,400
 so they can help me figure out 
      what my problem is.       

381
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,900
Did you try talking to Paul?    

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,300
                        (scoffs)

383
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,100
  No, I did not talk to Paul!   

384
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,500
Well, he's always helped me.    

385
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
He's got a super                
outlook on life.                

386
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,700
                You know,       

387
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,600
          when I heard that song
            starting to play,   

388
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,300
suddenly, it all                
came back to me.                

389
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,200
Everything that I said          
last night.                     

390
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,800
                    Oh!         
    Oh, God, Sam!               

391
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,100
Why is this happening to me?!   

392
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
  Because you don't love him.   

393
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
I know. I <i>did</i> love him.         

394
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,700
         Well, m-maybe you loved
        him when he was rich,   

395
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,300
but that's different now.       

396
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,100
                 What?! What are
                     you saying?

397
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
        Are you saying that I   
          only cared about Robin

398
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,700
              when he had money?

399
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,500
Well, it's the truth, isn't it? 

400
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
            How dare you tell me

401
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
        that I only loved him   
                  for his money!

402
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,800
          I am not that shallow.

403
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,900
                I am not that   
                    superficial.

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
        I am not that creepy!   

405
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
        You think that I only   
        loved him for his money.

406
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,200
                Well, you are   
                  wrong, buster,

407
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,100
and I'm gonna prove it.         

408
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,100
Robin! Ed! Bobby!               

409
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,100
        Hit it!

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,100
         Cliff, let's try to put
         the cake back together.

413
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,500
Forget the cake.                

414
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,300
How are we going to get         
these presents re-wrapped?

Fish and Game Commission...     

420
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,900
             Oops.              

421
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,200
             Sorry.             

422
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,500
That's... that's                
all right, Ed.                  

423
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,900
We've, um...                    
We've prepared our own vows.

ED:                             
Oh. Go ahead.                   

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,600
Shall I compare thee            
to a Summer's day?              

426
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,000
Thou art more lovely            
and more temperate:             

427
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Rough winds do shake            
the darling buds of May         

428
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,200
and Summer's lease have all     
too short a stay:               

429
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,600
Sometime too hot the eye        
of heaven doth shine,           

430
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,500
and often is his                
gold complexion dimmed;         

431
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,400
And every fair from fair        
sometime declines,              

432
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,800
by chance or nature's changing  
course untrimmed;               

433
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,100
But thy eternal Summer          
shall not fade,                 

434
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,300
nor lose possession             
of that fair thou owest;        

435
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,900
Nor shall Death brag            
thou wanderest in his shade     

436
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,300
when in eternal lines           
to time thou owest:             

437
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,400
As long as men can breathe      

438
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,600
or eyes can see,                

439
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,700
so long lives this,             

440
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,400
and this gives life to thee.    

441
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,800
    R-Rebecca?                  

442
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,400
     I only loved you           
     for your money.            

443
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,500
            REBECCA:            
          I'm hateful.          

444
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,700
I am the most awful person      
that I have ever met in my life.

445
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,700
        I don't deserve to live.

446
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,800
      Carla, what am I gonna do?

447
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,100
You could throw yourself        
into the Charles.               

448
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,500
            I don't think so.   

449
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,100
How about heaving yourself off  
the Prudential Building?        

450
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,200
That's a 52-story drop.         

451
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,500
You hit the pavement,           

452
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,300
they'll be scraping you up      
with a spatula,                 

453
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,600
just like they do               
in the cartoons!                

454
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,500
                    Oh!         

455
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,200
You know, Paul was right.       

456
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,300
    You can't help somebody     
 who doesn't want to be helped. 

457
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,800
        Aw, honey.              

458
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,500
Sweetheart?                     

459
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,300
I-I know it's been a hell       
of a day for you,               

460
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
and we all really               
feel bad for you,               

461
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,300
but there's just                
one more thing.                 

462
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,000
                 What?          

463
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,700
Well, it's kind of              
a good news-bad news thing.     

464
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,900
        Oh. What's the bad news?

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, the bad news is           

466
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,200
Robin's outside,                
and he wants to talk to you.    

467
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,900
                (groans)        
                Oh, my God.     

468
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,700
        What's the good news?   

469
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,500
I lied about the good news.     

470
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,300
Will you see him?               

471
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Hey, will you look at that!     

472
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
Your hair still retained        
its bounce!                     

473
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,700
I mean, that's something,       
isn't it?                       

474
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,800
            Rebecca?            

475
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
What's going on?                

476
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,100
  Have I done something wrong?  

477
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,300
  Oh, no. Robin, it's not you.  

478
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,400
            It's me.            

479
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
      I don't understand.       

480
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,000
      Oh, I can't say this      
         to your face.          

481
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,100
      Please turn around.       

482
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,500
                 Oh, gee, you've
                got a cute butt.

483
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,300
    Robin, I can't say this     
         to your butt.          

484
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
              Turn around again.

485
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
    I don't love you, Robin.    

486
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,600
     When did this happen?      

487
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
             Well,              

488
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
        near as I can figure,   

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,400
about the time they sealed      
your safe deposit box.          

490
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,300
 But I thought you were the one 
who didn't care about my money. 

491
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,600
      I thought you were the one
who was going to stand by me.   

492
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,100
I thought I was your sweet baby.

493
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
        No.                     

494
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,400
You was my rich baby.           

495
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
         All right, so,         

496
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,300
you loved me                    
for my money.                   

497
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,600
Well, what if I were            
to tell you                     

498
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
     that I had $6 million      
          stashed away          

499
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
        in a money belt         
    before my arrest?           

500
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
      Now, would that make      
        any difference?         

501
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,400
              No.               

502
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,200
        No, it wouldn't.        

503
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
             I see.             

504
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
        (clicks tongue)         

505
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,000
         Well...                

506
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,000
          What's that?          

507
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,700
          $6 million.           

508
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
    Farewell, Rebecca.          

509
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,900
Honey, I hope you don't mind,   
but I was listening outside.    

510
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,600
I can't believe                 
you turned down all that cash!  

511
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,600
You're changing, honey.         

512
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,800
That was the bravest thing      
I've ever seen you do!          

513
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,600
        (sobbing):              
I thought he was bluffing,      

514
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,000
        Sam!                    

515
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,300
Just let me go!                 

516
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
                  No! <i>No!</i>       

517
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,900
                       <i>No!</i>      

518
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:09,788
