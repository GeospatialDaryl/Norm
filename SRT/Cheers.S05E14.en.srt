1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,921
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,424
Here's something about
a show of impressionists

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,925
coming to Boston this fall.

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,343
Well, why wait?

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,345
I do one that'll knock your socks off.

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,131
He's talkin' about
French painters, doofus.

7
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:16,466
Yeah? Well, so am I.

8
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,468
Yeah, I do a great Cezanne.

9
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:20,854
Get outta here. No, I do. Watch this.

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,773
(French accent): Hosey,
posey, life is perfect.

11
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,859
(as John Wayne): Hey, ya better smile

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,861
when ya say that, Pilgrim.

13
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,863
(as James Stewart): Now, now, now, now,

14
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,865
just a-just a darned
second there, young fella.

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,867
(all chuckling)

16
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,370
Okay, okay, I got one. Watch this.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
(with country accent): Hey, fellers.

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,045
I believe we might be
in for just a little rain

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,913
before this day's over.

20
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,631
Woody, who is that?

21
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,801
It's Dwight Womack,
mayor of Hanover, Indiana.

22
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,589
No, Woody, Woody, when
you do impressions,

23
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,591
you gotta do impressions
of famous people.

24
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,477
Well, if I could do somebody famous,

25
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,978
why would I be doin' Dwight Womack?

26
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,480
Yeah, good point.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,482
Yeah, he's got a point.

28
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,854

(all calling out greetings)

45
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,228
Sam?

46
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:31,568
This is our first time
back in Cheers since,

47
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,069
you know, yesterday.

48
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,572
Don't you think we should
announce our engagement?

49
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,073
Oh. All right. Okay.

50
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,575
Go ahead. Go ahead.

51
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,576
Oh, no, no, you do it.

52
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,444
You're the man.

53
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:42,579
All right, listen up, everybody.

54
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,164
I have an announcement to make here.

55
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,498
Uh, Diane and I decided to...

56
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,499
Oh, Sam, (clears throat)

57
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,500
what are you going to say?

58
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,502
Well, I was just going to tell them...

59
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,503
(speaks softly)

60
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,372
I see.

61
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,624
SAM: Well, what do you want me to say?

62
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,260
(Diane whispering)

63
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,096
Oh, come on, Diane, nobody
knows who the Lunts are.

64
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,052
Due to our desire
to be-- what?

65
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,054
Conjoined. Conjoined, uh...

66
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,057
hey, well, Diane and I, uh,

67
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,560
would like you to, uh, celebrate with us

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,562
by, uh, toasting our nuptials.

69
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,946
Ouch.

70
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,233
No, no, Woody, it's, uh...

71
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,072
What Sam so eloquently
expressed was that he and I

72
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,576
have officially become
engaged to be married.

73
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,045
(cheering and applause)

74
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,548
How about that Al, huh?

75
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,050
CLIFF: Oh, marriage, Sam.

76
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,501
I thought you'd said
you'd never marry Diane.

77
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,005
Well, I-I never, uh, said that exactly.

78
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,923
No, no, I think the exact
words were "I'd rather have

79
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,925
every hair on my body
pulled out simultaneously."

80
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,930
Well, that-that's just an expression.

81
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,432
I mean...

82
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,933
No, seriously, you know,

83
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,436
we all knew it was going
to happen sooner or later.

84
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,438
I just thought I'd get it over with.

85
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,356
Well, Diane, Sam,
congratulations to both of you.

86
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:01,858
Diane, I hope you're planning

87
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,860
to stay for the entire
ceremony this time.

88
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,744
Ours was... (laughs)

89
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,449
Ours was very touching, I thought.

90
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,834
Well, another one bites
the matrimonial dust.

91
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,336
I guess that leaves only one stud

92
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,204
to satisfy all the babes in this bar.

93
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,091
Yeah, I can handle it, too.

94
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,594
Hi.

95
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,097
I bet you never thought
you'd see the day, huh?

96
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,098
Nice shirt, Sam.

97
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,100
Is it new?

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,968
No, it's not. It, uh...

99
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,803
Did you hear what I said up there

100
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,189
about me and Diane getting engaged?

101
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,440
The beer distributor called.

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,942
He wants to know if he can change

103
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,694
the delivery day to Wednesday.

104
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,198
Carla,

105
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,535
I know that we haven't
always seen eye-to-eye,

106
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,371
but you could at least wish us well.

107
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,739
I need a draft.

108
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,375
Fascinating.

109
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,377
She's experiencing denial.

110
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,879
What's that mean, Dr. Crane?

111
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,383
Well, simply put, it
means that the human mind

112
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,387
blocks out that which it
cannot emotionally accept.

113
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,390
What's that mean, Dr. Crane?

114
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,395
It means that you don't understand this,

115
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,896
and you never will.

116
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,899
Oh.

117
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,154
I think perhaps I should get
personally involved in this.

118
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,655
After all, Carla is a good friend.

119
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,524
I think I could help her

120
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,859
alleviate her suffering.

121
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,163
Besides, there's nothing good on TV.

122
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,614
So I don't see any ring here.

123
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,116
What gives, you guys, huh?

124
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:36,119
Well, we're doing a little
window shopping. Yeah?

125
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,004
But she's got her eye
on a big ol' diamond

126
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,006
in the window of, uh,
Barton and Lyles. Yeah?

127
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,008
Oh, no, no, Sam.

128
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,510
Now that's much too expensive.

129
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,512
I would be content with any one

130
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,382
of the smaller stones we saw today.

131
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,383
Oh, now wait a second.

132
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,101
Hey, Woody, give me the
phone there, will ya?

133
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,554
Listen, you might as
well have the best ring.

134
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,055
You got the best husband.

135
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,557
Hmm?

136
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,059
Is it any wonder I love you?

137
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,060
I'm twice blessed.

138
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,062
I'm getting the most wonderful guy

139
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:07,066
and one helluva rock.

140
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,904
Yeah, let me, uh, let me find out

141
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,906
just how much this thing is here.

142
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,909
Yeah, find out there, Sammy.

143
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,879
Hi, uh, you got a ring in
the window there by the door?

144
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
It's a big diamond

145
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
with two little diamonds
on either side there.

146
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,384
Yeah, uh, that's the one.

147
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,386
Yeah, how-how much does that cost?

148
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,889
(laughs)

149
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,759
How much?

150
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,228
Fifty-two hundred.

151
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,596
(all laughing)

152
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,231
Boy, what am I going to do here?

153
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,483
Bruce. What?

154
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,934
Friend of mine in the jewelry business.

155
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,270
He buys diamonds and gold wholesale

156
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,738
and then you don't
have to pay the markup,

157
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,106
which is like a zillion percent.

158
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,858
Oh, you know, that-that's
kinda silly. No, no.

159
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,610
It's the same gold, same diamonds.

160
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,863
Well, if it's the same
ring, it's the same ring.

161
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:54,864
Absolutely.

162
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,365
Give me the phone. All right.

163
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,618
Yeah, I'll call the
guy. Yeah, do it, do it.

164
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,837
Uh, Sam, I don't think
that's a good idea.

165
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,622
Why not?

166
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,624
Diane's not the kind of
woman who'd like to find out

167
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,125
that her ring was bought from a jeweler

168
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,128
who begins every transaction
with, "Psst, buddy."

169
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,098
Oh, no, you make...

170
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,100
you're makin' it sound worse than it is.

171
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,352
I mean, I'm sure everything's legit.

172
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,187
All right, fine, Bruce. Great.

173
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,189
Psst, Sammy, come here.

174
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,649
Dee-daa. Huh?

175
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,151
Not bad for 1,200 bucks, huh?

176
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,653
WOODY: Wow, I'll say.

177
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,121
Hey, Carla, you, uh, see the ring

178
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,622
that Sammy got for Diane here?

179
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,124
You know, I'm thinking

180
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,126
about having my house texture-coated.

181
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,129
You have your choice
of 24 decorator colors.

182
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,380
Amazing.

183
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,166
Yeah, and surprisingly reasonable.

184
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,167
SAM: Hey, hey, hey.

185
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,169
Hey, you guys, you
want to see a classic?

186
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,170
Here, watch.

187
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,173
Hi, Diane. Hi, Sam.

188
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,174
Oh boy, hey, you know,

189
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,176
that finger looks a little warm there.

190
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,562
Maybe you should cool
it down with some ice.

191
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,013
(gasps): Sam.

192
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,483
What? What? What's the
matter? What's wrong?

193
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
Nothing.

194
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,352
It's beautiful.

195
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,237
Oh. Oh.

196
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,740
Just think, hours ago,

197
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,243
I was admiring this
magnificent ring in the window,

198
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:18,247
thinking it was an
unattainable treasure.

199
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,617
And now, here it is on my finger.

200
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:22,952
Yep, there it is, all right.

201
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:23,953
That's the one.

202
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,338
How about that, huh?

203
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,839
Oh, thank you, thank you.

204
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,840
Well, yeah... (chuckling)

205
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,342
Thank you. Yeah.

206
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,344
You're welcome.

207
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,346
NORM: Hey, uh, Carla, do you realize

208
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,298
that when Sammy and Diane get married,

209
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,799
uh, Diane's going to be your boss?

210
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,802
Nice shirt, Norm. Is it new?

211
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,223
Sam...

212
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:48,728
I felt that I couldn't
possibly ask you for this,

213
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,731
but now that you've actually gone out

214
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,233
and purchased it, I can tell you.

215
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,736
This is the only ring I ever wanted.

216
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,237
Mmm.

217
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,740
Where's the box?

218
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,742
Box?

219
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,127
Yeah, you know, the one it came in.

220
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:05,962
Oh, yeah, uh...

221
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,463
this, this one didn't seem to come

222
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,464
with one of those, did it?

223
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,837
Really?

224
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:17,173
Oh, I'm surprised they
didn't give you one,

225
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,176
especially considering how
much this must have cost.

226
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:21,677
Oh, well, they did, they did.

227
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,179
It's just that I told
them, uh, keep the box.

228
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,680
She'll just wear it.

229
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,185
That's what I said, all right.

230
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:30,570
(weak chuckle)

231
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,689
Sam?

232
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:34,574
Yeah.

233
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,193
This may sound frivolous,

234
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,028
but every woman wants to keep the box

235
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:41,530
that her engagement ring came in.

236
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,284
I already have a space reserved
for it in my memento drawer,

237
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,087
right between my French
Club pin and my retainer.

238
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,091
All right, all right.

239
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,593
I mean, fine, honey,

240
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
I'll just, uh, go on,

241
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,097
go back, and, uh... I'll get the box.

242
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,599
CLIFF: Uh, don't forget
your receipt there, Sammy.

243
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,719
Ah, they'll probably remember your face.

244
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,352
You can relax, everybody.

245
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,353
Got the box.

246
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,354
NORM: All right, Sammy.

247
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,855
They just, uh, gave it to ya, huh?

248
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,357
No, no, I had to buy something.

249
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,358
Oh, yeah?

250
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,359
Wha, wha, what'd you get?

251
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,744
Sterling silver corncob holders.

252
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,497
290 bucks.

253
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,865
Do you believe that?

254
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,200
Wow. Why'd you buy those things?

255
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,086
Well, everything else
seemed like such a rip-off.

256
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,423
I'm still way ahead, though. It's okay.

257
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,425
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

258
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,926
Think about it.

259
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,795
Oh, Sam, there you are.

260
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,046
Yeah, and here you
are, my little darling.

261
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,547
One ring box, just your size.

262
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,548
How 'bout that, huh?

263
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,049
You happy?

264
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,550
Delirious.

265
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,051
Oh, good.

266
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,053
I just wish I'd gone with you

267
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,554
when you went back to Barton and Lyles.

268
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,057
I want to buy myself that dress.

269
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,558
Oh, which dress is that?

270
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,561
The one in the window.

271
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,563
Right next door in Justine's window.

272
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,564
Don't you remember?

273
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,066
I was admiring it as we walked by.

274
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,068
Oh, sure, sure, sure, yeah.

275
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,069
Yeah... oh, it's perfect.

276
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,070
I'd love it.

277
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,072
Well, you know, it's kinda slack now.

278
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,073
Why don't ya take off?

279
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:14,573
Do a little shopping.

280
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,076
Really? Yeah, go ahead.

281
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,078
Oh, Sam. Uh.

282
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,579
I'll get my purse.

283
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,081
All right.

284
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:22,581
So, uh, Sammy...

285
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,083
when Diane sees the ring

286
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,085
in the window of the fancy store

287
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,086
and also on her finger,

288
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,587
what do you think she'll say?

289
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,173
Well, I'm off.

290
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:34,143
Uh, no, Diane, uh, wait a second here.

291
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:35,144
Uh, I can't...

292
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,646
I can't let you go through with this.

293
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,147
What?

294
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,649
Well, uh, I, I bought

295
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,651
that dress for ya.

296
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:46,072
Sam Malone...

297
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,073
Yeah.

298
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,574
I don't believe you.

299
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,575
No, it's a fact.

300
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,576
It's in my car right up there.

301
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,578
Oh, you scamp.

302
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,446
Oh, go get it, please.

303
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,914
Uh, you know, I...

304
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,416
I was kinda hopin' to
surprise you with it.

305
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,419
Well, I already know about it now.

306
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,420
Right.

307
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,422
What am I standin' here for then, huh?

308
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,423
(laughing)

309
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,424
Oh...

310
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,425
Say, you know, that's, uh...

311
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,429
that was such an interesting dress.

312
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,931
How would you describe that color?

313
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,932
Pink.

314
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,934
Pink! Right.

315
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,302
You always know the perfect word.

316
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,219
Pink.

317
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,472
Who woulda thought?

318
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,531
I wonder what's keeping Sam.

319
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,533
He's certainly been gone a long time.

320
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,284
Where is Sam?

321
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,622
"Where is Sam?"

322
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,126
(quietly): I think she's starting
to relate to her environment again.

323
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,077
FRASIER: Well, I think
we've made great progress.

324
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,462
Carla,

325
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,080
can you tell me who Sam is?

326
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,249
Of course. He's my boss.

327
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,052
Did you know that he is
now engaged to be married?

328
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,004
Yes. I'm very happy for him.

329
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,390
See how well we've done?

330
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,892
Carla...

331
00:12:56,892 --> 00:13:01,764
who is the charming soul
that has agreed to marry him?

332
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,149
Norm.

333
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,604
Well, I'm not the miracle worker.

334
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,108
Here we go.

335
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,030
The one you wanted and, uh, three more.

336
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,031
Oh, Sam!

337
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,032
What?

338
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,035
You impetuous fool. Oh, I love them.

339
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,037
(chuckling): Oh. Oh, thank you.

340
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,922
Uh-huh. Wait a minute.

341
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,707
You were gone an awfully long time.

342
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,593
I thought you were
just going to your car.

343
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,045
Well, I got a-a parking ticket,

344
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,432
and I, uh, I wanted
to fight it in court.

345
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,856
Do I, uh, detect a snafu there, Sammy?

346
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,525
Every damn dress in the window was pink.

347
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,862
Oh, boy, that must have,
uh, cost you a pretty penny.

348
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,863
That's all right.

349
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,364
I'll get some of it back.

350
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,233
She couldn't possibly
like all four of them.

351
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,569
Oh, Sam, I love all of them.

352
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,406
I can't decide which one
to wear tonight to dinner.

353
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,374
Oh, go... oh, boy, uh, right.

354
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,743
What did we say, uh, 7:00?

355
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,662
Oh, could we make it a little later?

356
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:09,665
I have to stop by the store
to get the ring appraised.

357
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:11,550
Pardon me?

358
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,553
The insurance man said

359
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,056
that there has to be
an appraisal on file

360
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:22,061
in order to have this
covered in my theft policy.

361
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,564
Boy, they, uh... they
don't make it easy, do they?

362
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,267
Uh, I'll tell you what.

363
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,768
Why don't you, uh, let me handle that?

364
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,769
I'll have it appraised.

365
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,771
Uh, why... yeah, why
don't you give me the ring?

366
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,273
Oh, no, Sam!

367
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,276
Just as our love is
forever, so is this ring.

368
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,777
From here on out,

369
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,663
it will never leave my finger.

370
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,781
Beautiful.

371
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,583
That's really beautiful.

372
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,586
Woody, you want to get
me some aspirin there?

373
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,456
Sam, I think this has gone too far.

374
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,791
You're caught in a quagmire of deceit.

375
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,793
You're just going to
sink deeper and deeper,

376
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,794
and to what avail?

377
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,796
To my butt's avail.

378
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,800
Yeah, maybe you're right.

379
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,801
Maybe I should just...

380
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,803
bite the bullet and be honest with her.

381
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,806
I mean, I really want
this relationship to work.

382
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,191
We do, too, Sammy.

383
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,145
Uh, Diane?

384
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,147
Yes.

385
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,615
I, uh, I have something
I want to say to you.

386
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,617
Uh, I'm afraid you're
not going to like it.

387
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,120
After receiving this...

388
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,123
beautiful symbol of
our relationship--

389
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,625
a symbol that has
touched me very deeply--

390
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:31,130
nothing you say could
ever disappoint me.

391
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,997
What is it?

392
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,585
I have to go to the doctor.

393
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,972
What for? No, it's nothing serious.

394
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,473
It's, uh...

395
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,474
I just figured that, you know,

396
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,475
we-we're getting married.

397
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,977
Uh, I might as well have a check-up

398
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,981
and make sure the old
Evinrude's still cranking.

399
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,484
I don't see any cause for alarm in that.

400
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,485
No.

401
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,854
In fact, I think it's quite sensible.

402
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,072
Good, good.

403
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,023
I love the dresses.

404
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,024
Oh, me, too.

405
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,409
Thanks so much.

406
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:01,860
Lovely.

407
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,363
So, uh, what now, Kemo Sammy?

408
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,366
It's no problem. It's no problem.

409
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,367
I'll just, uh... I'll
go back to the store

410
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,370
and I'll... I'll handle it.

411
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,872
Tell you, though... no way in the world

412
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,758
am I going to buy that expensive ring.

413
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,677
The ring is bought. Oh, yeah.

414
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,557
CLIFF: Oh, you shelled out

415
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,942
for the ring in the
window, didn't you, Sammy?

416
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,028
Yeah.

417
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:36,862
Uh-huh.

418
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,732
I got a real interesting price on it.

419
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,399
Full price?

420
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,151
Right around there, yeah.

421
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,905
As soon as I switch this one
for the... ring on her finger,

422
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,291
my problems are over.

423
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,077
Oh, Sam, what did the doctor say?

424
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,047
Same thing he always does: "Wow!"

425
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,638
But you're fine, yes?

426
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,139
SAM: Oh, yeah, no problem there.

427
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:05,641
No, uh...

428
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,009
You know, actually, I-I was sitting

429
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,894
in the, uh, waiting room there,

430
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:09,895
and I, uh, realized that, uh,

431
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,398
I had never officially put

432
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,400
that ring on your finger, and I'd...

433
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,901
well, I'd kind of like to.

434
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,905
Sam, you're just
sweeping me off my feet.

435
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,409
Um, okay, well, uh, close your eyes.

436
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,410
Why?

437
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,911
Uh, well, there, uh...

438
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,413
there-there's something
I want to say to you,

439
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,914
and, uh, I might get embarrassed

440
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,917
if-if you saw me... say it.

441
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,918
Okay.

442
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,920
All right. I can't wait to hear this.

443
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,422
Right...

444
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:43,762
Diane... you're really neat.

445
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,135
I think this big step we've taken

446
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,137
has made you positively goofy.

447
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,538
Well, maybe it has.

448
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,890
That's me-- just
one big goof.

449
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,726
(chuckles)

450
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,728
Yeah, they, uh... they
haven't found a chick

451
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,230
that can outsmart me.

452
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,232
All right, Sammy.

453
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,652
Did he say "chick" or "chimp"?

454
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:10,372
(phone ringing)

455
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,376
Cheers.

456
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,330
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

457
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,833
Norman is uncharacteristically absent.

458
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,336
May I... take a message for him?

459
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,838
Uh-huh.

460
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,340
Bruce wants to know about the ring?

461
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,843
Mm-hmm.

462
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,847
Uh-huh...

463
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,350
Yes, I think it's safe to say

464
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,355
that Sam's fiancée was
completely fooled by it.

465
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,870
Boy, I'm starved.

466
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,373
I hear it's a great restaurant.

467
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,382
You're quite the little
chatterbox tonight.

468
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,851
Oh, you want me to talk?

469
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,354
Well, it's not necessary.

470
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,355
Fine, I'll talk.

471
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,856
I don't appreciate

472
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,359
being given junk jewelry

473
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,860
and then lied to about it.

474
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,863
Oh, now, wait a second, that
is not junk jewelry, Diane.

475
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,366
Oh, Sam, please, no more lies.

476
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,367
How could you pledge

477
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,869
your troth with a paste ring?

478
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:31,870
Oh, that is not a paste ring!

479
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,871
All right, all right, there was...

480
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,872
there was another ring.

481
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:34,873
I... but I switched it

482
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,874
for the one in the window.

483
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:36,875
I swear to God I did, Diane!

484
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,877
Oh, please, don't bother swearing.

485
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,379
You have no idea what this day has...

486
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,381
I know this obviously
means nothing to you.

487
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,383
I'd rather go without than wear a lie.

488
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,384
SAM: No, no, no!

489
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:49,388
(tires screeching) (crashing)

490
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,477
Explain that part about
switching rings again.

491
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,648
Oh, there's something shiny!

492
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:04,069
No. Just another paper wrapper.

493
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,572
(sighs)

494
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,076
Oh, look at us. We're filthy.

495
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,579
Yeah.

496
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,082
By the way, I hate that dress.

497
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:23,038
Considering the circumstances
under which it was obtained,

498
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,540
it's hardly one of my favorites anymore.

499
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,542
Okay.

500
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,044
Then I can count on you not wearing it

501
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,545
when you visit me in the poorhouse

502
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:32,047
that you put me in.

503
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,549
Oh, Sam, get off it.

504
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,551
No, no, no, wait a second.

505
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,937
Le-Let's tally up the damages here.

506
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,357
The first ring was $1,200.

507
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:44,860
The box was $290.

508
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,865
Four lovely pink frocks was a mere $950.

509
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,783
The, uh, damages on the car

510
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,285
will be at least a grand.

511
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,787
And let's not forget
about the $5,200 bite

512
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,073
I was hoping to avoid
in the first place.

513
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:03,078
Bringing it to a grand
total of $9,000...

514
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:06,081
for a ring I no longer have.

515
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:09,584
Well, I hasten to add that this
was all of your own volition.

516
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:10,585
SAM: Ah...

517
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,090
$290 for the box?

518
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,425
Yeah.

519
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,311
Do you like... do you
like corn on the cob?

520
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,653
Well, I guess I'm just stupid to think

521
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,604
that I could make someone like you happy

522
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:33,108
on a budget of someone like me.

523
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,113
I'm sorry.

524
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:39,614
Well, you should be.

525
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:46,121
All right, I said I was!

526
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,624
Give me a bit of slack.

527
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:54,129
(sighs)

528
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:59,634
Even... had that been
the... bargain ring,

529
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:00,635
it would've been

530
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:03,638
sinfully impetuous
of me to cast it away.

531
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,641
Well, here's the bargain ring right now.

532
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:10,145
Why don't you give it
the old heave-ho, too?

533
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,614
Hmm...

534
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,616
Hmm.

535
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm somehow reminded of a fable penned

536
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,624
by an anonymous 18th century author...

537
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:25,627
concerning the young mistress

538
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,546
of a great feudal estate

539
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,965
and a woodchopper who
worked on the estate...

540
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:34,920
Diane... not now, please?

541
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,426
Could I just tell you the moral?

542
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,929
What?

543
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,431
You're really neat.

544
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,408
Hardly a rich soul, I know.

545
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,411
The fact remains that...

546
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,330
no matter what the cost...

547
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,368
a ring is, above all else,

548
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:07,869
a symbol of the feelings

549
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:12,374
that two people have for each other.

550
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,879
So, truly, Sam, this is the ring I want.

551
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,383
Whoa, whoa, whoa, here.

552
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,886
Let me do this.

553
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,389
Uh...

554
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:34,396
But nothing says we can't keep looking.

555
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,627
(screaming): No!
