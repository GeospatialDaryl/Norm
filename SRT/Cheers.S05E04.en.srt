1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:06,256
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,092
MAN (on TV): ...so grab your rod
and reel, and join us next week

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:13,596
when Jim takes us trolling
on Lake Winnebeshaki.

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,016
Nice show, huh?

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
Well, if you ask me,
there's something wrong

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
with watching televised fishing.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,905
Not the same impact

8
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,157
as watching it live, huh, Woody?

9
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,492
Hey, you know something?

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,493
I got a great idea.

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,994
What's to stop us

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,246
from taking a little
fishing trip ourselves?

13
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:31,581
We don't want to?

14
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,582
Oh.

15
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:33,583
Come on, it'd be fun.

16
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,451
You know, we could go

17
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,835
this very afternoon,

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,337
head out to Lake Winthrop, huh?

19
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,205
What do you say? NORM: All right.

20
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,124
Okay. All right, let's get
organized here, uh, Woody.

21
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,625
Uh, I'd like you to be in charge

22
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,626
of bait and tackle, okay?

23
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,627
Got you.

24
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,628
Cliffy in charge of, uh,

25
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,629
food and the transportation.

26
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,630
Okay.

27
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,516
Well, what're you in
charge of, Mr. Peterson?

28
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,800
Finding a reason not to go.

29
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,553
Ah, here we go.

30
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,855
Huh? Gladiator film
festival at the Majestic.

31
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,856

Hi, Sam.

52
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,360
Hi.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,862
Oh, uh,

54
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:26,863
some customer was in

55
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,615
with some tickets to some concert,

56
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,399
sounded foreign and dull.

57
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,284
I thought you wouldn't want to miss it.

58
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,652
Thank you.

59
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,653
(gasps)

60
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,039
Jean Pierre Rampal!

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,657
It was just some customer. I
didn't really catch his name.

62
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,076
Oh.

63
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,961
He's a flautist.

64
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,247
Nothing less than brilliant.

65
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,634
No other player could so
eloquently fuse the world of

66
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,970
classical music to that of modern jazz.

67
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,340
What a perfect performer for us to see

68
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,594
on this, our first
official date together

69
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,096
in our new-found relationship.

70
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,098
What should I wear?

71
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
Something long or tea length?

72
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,488
Why don't you wear something
you can stretch out in?

73
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,355
Oh.

74
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,858
The seat next to you's gonna be empty.

75
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,276
Sam!

76
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,277
Come on, please.

77
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,663
Can't you scrape somebody
else up to go? Please.

78
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,449
And the operative
word there is "scrape."

79
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,953
There's only one man I want to be with.

80
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,673
No, no, I'll go alone.

81
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,174
And it'll be fine. Mm.

82
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,626
Miss Chambers,

83
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,878
I might be back from my fishing trip

84
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,179
in time to take you,

85
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,682
if I don't stop to clean up first.

86
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,552
No, thank you, Woody, that's very sweet.

87
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,553
Maybe next time.

88
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,554
Okeydoke, but I don't know

89
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,439
when I'm gonna be going fishing again.

90
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,311
Cliffy, it was not ten.
I had 11 of 'em. 11!

91
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,813
You're wrong, Normie,
you're wrong, wrong, wrong.

92
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,699
How was the Gladiator film fest, fellas?

93
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,566
CLIFF: Not now, Sammy.

94
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,401
We're awash in controversy.

95
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,655
You had ten, Norm,

96
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,656
just like me.

97
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,657
Ten what?

98
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,659
Anachronisms. Huh?

99
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,127
Oh, you know, those things that, uh,

100
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,629
aren't in the time period
in which the film is set.

101
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,631
Normie and I like to see
who-who gets the most.

102
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,633
Today it was me. 11!

103
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,635
Normie, you had ten just like me.

104
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:13,636
There was no way

105
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,638
it was Caesar Augustus wearing Reeboks.

106
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,892
Hey, so you guys ready

107
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,394
to go fishing? Uh...

108
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,347
we got to... You know,
Woody, uh, couple beers first.

109
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,350
You know, I work up a
powerful thirst watching,

110
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,852
uh, Thoracian dogs smite
Spartan pigs, you know.

111
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,856
Greetings, everyone.

112
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,857
Hey, Frasier.

113
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,109
How about a beer?

114
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,411
Oh, well, no, Sam, just
make it a club soda.

115
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,412
I've got to appear on TV today,

116
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,281
and I want to keep my wits about me.

117
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782
Oh my! SAM: No kidding?

118
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,083
What's the TV show?
FRASIER: Well, it's a

119
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,085
local talk show called
Psychology This Week.

120
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,086
Oh.

121
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,588
Oh, maybe you heard it. I don't know.

122
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:49,956
I know all about that show.

123
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,841
It's where once a week a couple

124
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,842
of shrinks get together

125
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,344
and debate certain aspects

126
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,845
of the psychological condition.

127
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:56,963
That's right. NORM: Oh, man,

128
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,299
we had to pick today to
go fishing, huh, Cliff?

129
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:01,934
Well, I'm surprised.

130
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,304
I didn't know you were a fan.

131
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,221
SAM: Hmm...

132
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,223
Well, he was, but he stopped watching

133
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,609
when they lost the hostess
with the big Hindenburgs.

134
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,396
It's on at 4:00.

135
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,897
It promises to be very cerebral,

136
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,784
and, uh, I might add,
uh, darned entertaining.

137
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,951
Well, uh,

138
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,237
unfortunately, Frasier, it interferes

139
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,239
with another highly
cerebral event--

140
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,241
the, uh, Raiders
- Patriots game.

141
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,626
SAM: Yeah, right.

142
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,077
I realize that football

143
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,580
is a rarity on television in the fall,

144
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,966
but don't you think we
could spare half an hour

145
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,468
to see our friend, Frasier?

146
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,920
Do you have any idea how
much action you can miss

147
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,921
in a half an hour of football?

148
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,890
About 18 seconds.

149
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,011
Oh, all right, all right.

150
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,263
I guess it won't hurt... much.

151
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,765
Thank you, Sam.

152
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,768
(phone ringing)

153
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,270
Cheers. Yeah, hold on a second.

154
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,154
Oh.

155
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,073
You want to tell me what
the taxicab was doing,

156
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,075
uh, parked in front of
the Temple of Athena?

157
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:03,079
Yeah... all right,
uh, it was, uh... uh...

158
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:07,950
it was, uh, probably taking
Demitrius to the airport.

159
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,669
Well, thank you.

160
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,003
(clearing throat)

161
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,004
Well, as it turns out,

162
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,007
you can now watch your game
with a clear conscience.

163
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,510
I won't be doing that show after all.

164
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,762
What changed your mind, Frasier?

165
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,882
Well, Dr. Foster had
to cancel, and, uh...

166
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,017
Dr. Sternin is going to take his place.

167
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,054
Lilith Sternin?

168
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,307
You mean that-- uh,
pardon my French--

169
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,309
woman you once dated?

170
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,313
That's a rather charitable
description, Cliff.

171
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,198
Well, I just hope they can find someone

172
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,451
to replace me as readily
as they did Dr. Foster.

173
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,653
Can't handle debating a woman, eh?

174
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,904
A woman, yes.

175
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,406
An ice cube in heels, no!

176
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,243
Look, I have no intention
of entering a debate

177
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,746
with those cold, gray eyes and
those clever, smirking lips.

178
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,249
I'd rather clip my nails in a Cuisinart.

179
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,804
Oh, my.

180
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,172
What's wrong?

181
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,557
Oh, don't you see?

182
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,925
Frasier's in love.

183
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,176
He's what?

184
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,678
Oh, come on, Sam.

185
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,179
You're forgetting I was once

186
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,682
romantically involved with Frasier.

187
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,184
I know when he's enamored of someone.

188
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,437
Didn't you see his nostrils flare?

189
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,358
And everyone knows that hate
is not the opposite of love.

190
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,743
Indifference is.

191
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,194
Well, whatever you say.

192
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,579
I really don't care.

193
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,869
Touch?, Sam.

194
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,754
Let's be honest.

195
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,539
Quite often you've expressed

196
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,541
feelings of antagonism toward me,

197
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,543
and we both know how much you love me.

198
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,961
I...

199
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,463
I do not love you, Diane,

200
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,715
and I have the nostrils to prove it.

201
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,517
And you...

202
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:48,885
You're wrong about Frasier.

203
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,386
I mean, I know
psychobabble when I hear it,

204
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,387
and I also...

205
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,638
Wait. Uh...

206
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,391
Frasier? There's a theory

207
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,392
going around the bar

208
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,644
that you're ticked off with Dr. Sternin

209
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,979
because you're in love with her.

210
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,980
What do you think?

211
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,482
Well, that sounds like someone

212
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
who doesn't know shortcake from Shinola.

213
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
Hey, good guess,
good guess-- Diane.

214
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,370
FRASIER: Oh, well, hmm.

215
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,655
That's nothing but mere
cocktail-party psychology.

216
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,574
Believe it or not, Sam,
it's actually possible

217
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,075
to have hostile feelings toward someone

218
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,460
without being in love with them.

219
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,795
You mean I can actually hate Diane

220
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,297
without having it mean
anything more than I hate her?

221
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,216
Feel free. Ooh!

222
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:21,467
Oh, I better cancel

223
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,803
that appearance before it's too late.

224
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,804
Hang on. There you go.

225
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,172
CLIFF: Uh-oh!

226
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,007
Frost warning.

227
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,563
Good afternoon, Dr. Crane.

228
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,434
Dr. Sternin.

229
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,436
What a lovely surprise.

230
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,939
I hope I can regard that as civility

231
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,941
in light of today's situation,

232
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,943
rather than sarcasm at my expense.

233
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,196
No, that was completely at your expense.

234
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,250
You know, I wasn't
going to do today's show

235
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,252
when I heard you were the other guest,

236
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:57,753
but then I realized I'd relish

237
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:00,122
proving my superiority
over you in public.

238
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,542
Yes, that appeals to me, too.

239
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,544
So, I felt we should at least discuss

240
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,295
some procedures of conduct.

241
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,630
Ah, well...

242
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,131
Don't you dare.

243
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,018
My mistake.

244
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,387
So, am I to assume that
you just naturally thought

245
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,138
that I'd be at this
drinking establishment?

246
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,941
Actually, knowing your
obsessive-compulsiveness,

247
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,943
I checked with your service,

248
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,445
and indeed, you'd left them

249
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,947
a very complete itinerary of your day.

250
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:28,951
I trust all went well
at the dry cleaner's.

251
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,953
Thank you, yes.

252
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,456
And I can assume from your questioning

253
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,958
that you're attempting
to make idle conversation

254
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,461
rather than articulating
some control dysfunction

255
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,462
with my personal habits.

256
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:40,713
That's correct.

257
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,999
Are they fighting?

258
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,383
LILITH: First of all,

259
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,336
I think any mention of
our past relationship

260
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,840
could tarnish the objectivity
factor of the show.

261
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,341
You call that a relationship?

262
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,843
I mean, we dated one time.

263
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,345
The closest we came to physical contact

264
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,849
was when you closed
the car door on my hand.

265
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,350
Are you repressing? Oh!

266
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,235
Forgive me. Actually,
you're quite right.

267
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,237
Yes, I should be
straightforward in telling you

268
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,106
that you are passionless,
stoic and emotionally numb.

269
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,575
Apology accepted. Merci.

270
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,860
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

271
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,861
they're fighting.

272
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,863
He just asked for mercy.

273
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,282
Secondly, I think perhaps we...

274
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,783
Look, Dr. Sternin, if you'll excuse me,

275
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
I have to cash a check and fill up

276
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,286
my gas tank before the show.

277
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,287
Yes, I know.

278
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,173
Have the attendant make sure your tires

279
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,592
aren't as inflated as your ego.

280
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,846
You know, you perplex me.

281
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,515
Oh?

282
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,434
Yes, normally people of
your limited physical appeal

283
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,303
make up for it with
an actual personality.

284
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,895
Dr. Sternin, excuse me.

285
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,898
I overheard Dr. Crane's remarks.

286
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
If it's any consolation,

287
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,901
I can empathize with your hurt feelings.

288
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,904
If you'd like to share
any of them with me

289
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,907
as a fellow woman, I
would consider it an honor.

290
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,659
Who are you?

291
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,460
(chuckles softly)

292
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,962
Diane Chambers.

293
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,965
I'm an old friend of
Dr. Crane's, a student,

294
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,750
and until my imminent marriage,

295
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,135
an employee here at Cheers.

296
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,136
Please, let's sit down.

297
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,140
Well, I suppose I am
just a little sensitive

298
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,009
when it pertains to my appearance.

299
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,763
Well, if I may be so bold
as to step into your arena,

300
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,065
I believe that

301
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,567
Frasier's hostility

302
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,436
is masking a deep attraction to you.

303
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:31,273
(subdued chuckling)

304
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,275
Thank you, Diane.

305
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,778
It's been a long time since
I've had such a good laugh.

306
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,167
Why would Frasier Crane
be attracted to me?

307
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,418
I'm not that kind of woman.

308
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,420
But you can be.

309
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,422
It just takes a little
softening of the edges.

310
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,424
Perhaps loosen the bun a bit

311
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,676
to relieve some of the
tension in your face.

312
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,462
I'm afraid it's not as easy as all that.

313
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,214
Oh, that's nonsense. Look...

314
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,015
I'm not far from here.

315
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,017
Why don't you come over to my place,

316
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,385
and I'll show you what I mean?

317
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,220
We'll just put a little
more makeup on, or...

318
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,606
some.

319
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,358
I really don't think I can do that.

320
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,359
Oh, come on, Dr. Sternin.

321
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,729
You're going to be on television today.

322
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,647
A little refinement of your appearance

323
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,649
might give you an edge in the debate.

324
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,535
Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt.

325
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,370
Good, good! Let me get my things.

326
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,622
Sam,

327
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,207
may I have my purse, please? Oh,

328
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,042
and I'm going to be taking my lunch hour

329
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,043
a little early today.

330
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,544
Thank you for showing up at all.

331
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,547
You're welcome.

332
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,049
Shall we go?

333
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,417
You know, I've always

334
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,668
envied women like you

335
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,670
who could simply tumble
out of bed each morning

336
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,921
looking blonde and perky.

337
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,723
Oh, well, I must admit,

338
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,593
in my case, there is a
little labor involved.

339
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,844
A little labor?

340
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,847
She's calls in Local 416.

341
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,973
(TV plays) Yeah.

342
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:54,974
Oh. Yeah?

343
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,975
Come on, guys.

344
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,476
CLIFF: Yeah, I think they...

345
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,979
Okay, the tank's full,
and the gear's all loaded.

346
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,480
I got everything you could possibly need

347
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,865
for a fishing trip.

348
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,732
Uh, Woody, look, uh, we're right

349
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,234
in the middle of the game, huh?

350
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:08,120
I got a battery-operated
portable TV in the car.

351
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,072
We got a few beers to
finish here yet, buddy.

352
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:13,325
I got a cooler full
icing down in the trunk.

353
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,629
Yup, I think

354
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,630
the kid's outlasted us, Norm.

355
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,631
WOODY: Hot dog!

356
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,633
Look out, trout! (laughs)

357
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,419
Hey, if you guys don't
mind, I'll do the driving.

358
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,004
All right, I got shotgun.

359
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,339
Wouldn't it be more sporting
to use a fishing pole?

360
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,342
Oh, this is gonna be great!

361
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,596
ANNOUNCER: It's a
fumble. Davis picks it up

362
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,097
for the Patriots, He's
got a clear field...

363
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,599
Come on, come on, come on...

364
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,100
(all shouting)

365
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,602
(theme music plays) Aw, come on, Diane.

366
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,103
It's a great game. What're you do...?

367
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,356
Now let's all check our watches.

368
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,913
Did we not promise to watch
Frasier's show at 4:00?

369
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,198
All right, everybody see it?

370
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,199
ALL: Yeah.

371
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,200
(fans cheering on TV)

372
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,201
(affirmative shouts)

373
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,619
(indistinct voices)

374
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,504
All right, fine!

375
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,457
I'm not gonna play cat-and-mouse
with a silly remote control box.

376
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,459
You know, all you people ever see

377
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,961
of Frasier Crane is an ordinary Joe

378
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:08,848
sitting at the bar
being one of the guys.

379
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,966
You should see him in his métier.

380
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,185
He's a brilliantly perceptive man.

381
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,471
Does anybody have a
box that'll shut her up?

382
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,224
No, but I'd be glad to do it manually.

383
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,441
SAM: Oh!

384
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,693
Come on, you guys. We made a promise.

385
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,561
MAN: Aw, Sammy! Thank you, Sam.

386
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,697
HOST: First I'd like to introduce

387
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,148
Dr. Frasier Crane.

388
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,650
Dr. Crane is an eminent psychiatrist

389
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,651
here in the Boston area

390
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,654
specializing in treatment of phobias.

391
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:32,655
(applause)

392
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,907
Joining Dr. Crane in this discussion

393
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,408
is Dr. Lilith Sternin.

394
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,911
Dr. Sternin is a member
of the psychiatric staff

395
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,913
at Boston General Hospital.

396
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:41,914
(applause)

397
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,417
(crowd murmuring)

398
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,919
Welcome, Dr. Sternin.

399
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,920
Thank you. Dr. Crane.

400
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,178
You really made her
look beautiful, Diane.

401
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,682
Physician, heal thyself.

402
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:07,022
HOST: You've made many
excellent points, Dr. Sternin.

403
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,324
How do you respond to them,

404
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,326
Dr. Crane?

405
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,827
Dr. Crane?

406
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,329
Oh, excu... What was the question?

407
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,830
Oh, uh,

408
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,831
yes, of course.

409
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,832
Excuse me, uh...

410
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,335
Yes, my method of...

411
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,336
flooding, uh,

412
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,671
seeks out the patient's,

413
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,957
well, most sensitive and vulnerable spot

414
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,961
in the defense system, and, uh...

415
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,348
penetrates...

416
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,219
probing deeper and deeper

417
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:40,723
into the patient's psyche,

418
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:43,108
thrusting over and over.

419
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,529
And thereby uncovering the reality

420
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,398
behind the irrational fear.

421
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,870
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

422
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,872
Anything to add, Dr. Sternin?

423
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,873
Yes.

424
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,375
Uh...

425
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,876
(clears throat): Although

426
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,380
Dr. Crane's method is faster...

427
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:10,386
a slow and methodical approach
can be much more rewarding.

428
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,341
Gentle stroking of the psyche

429
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,760
will bring about a far more

430
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,763
intense release of emotion

431
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:26,151
building until the patient
quite often will literally

432
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,904
cry out in a release of

433
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,407
satisfaction and joy.

434
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,277
(gasping): Point well taken.

435
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,199
This intellectual stuff's
getting me all hot.

436
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,203
This is embarrassing.

437
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,204
We shouldn't be watching this.

438
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,705
Mm.

439
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,091
Well, maybe just a little while... Yeah.

440
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:54,129
...and that concludes
this afternoon's program.

441
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,514
Aw! Oh, no, no, hey.

442
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,515
Boo! Come on!

443
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,883
HOST: Dr. Sternin,

444
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,186
Dr. Crane, thank you for joining us.

445
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,188
Oh, excuse me.

446
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,191
For a written transcript
of this afternoon's show,

447
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,694
please send a self-addressed,
stamped envelope

448
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:13,198
to Psychology This Week, Box 84037,

449
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,701
Boston, Massachusetts,

450
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,203
0220...

451
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,072
5.

452
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,457
What was that box number again?

453
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,459
Uh, 02205.

454
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,051
Hey, fellas, how was the fishing trip?

455
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,053
Geez. It would have been a little better

456
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
without Cliff's jabbering.

457
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,057
Guy catches one fish,
turns into Ernest Hemingway.

458
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,979
Oh, congratulations, Cliff.

459
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,481
Thank you, Sammy.

460
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,484
Yeah, it was man against fish.

461
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,353
The rest of the world was shut out.

462
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,108
It was a good fish, a clean fish,

463
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,910
a strong fish.

464
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,996
A little fish.

465
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,034
Get that stinking,
slimy thing out of here.

466
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:08,537
And take your fish with you.

467
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,343
Oh, Frasier, I didn't expect

468
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,844
to see you here.

469
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,347
Thought you'd be exchanging
psychological positions

470
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,715
with Dr. Sternin.

471
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,186
Please, Sam.

472
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,055
I made a complete fool of
myself today and Dr. Sternin.

473
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,524
If they'd had a hose at the studio,

474
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,393
they would have turned it on us.

475
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,695
Actually, that sounds kind of fun.

476
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,950
I'll never be able to
look her in the eye again.

477
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,451
The only consolation is

478
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,820
that nobody ever watches that show.

479
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,989
Way to go, sex machine!

480
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm ruined.

481
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,211
Half of New England saw me today

482
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,713
as a rutting pig.

483
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,631
Come on, Frasier.

484
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,383
You're not in rut, you're in love.

485
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,667
Oh, nonsense!

486
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,669
I don't think that because
two people breathe heavily

487
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,171
on a TV show is any cause for them

488
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,672
to declare their undying love.

489
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,141
Breathe heavily?

490
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,892
I thought you were gonna
suck in a chair there.

491
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,596
Listen, a TV station

492
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,515
may not have been the
best place in the world

493
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,400
to sprout antlers, but it happened.

494
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,101
Go with it.

495
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,158
DIANE: Dr. Sternin, you're...

496
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,777
back.

497
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:25,614
Diane, I'd like to thank you
for your Pygmalion-like efforts.

498
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:28,617
I'd like to, but I can't,
because they led to disaster.

499
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,004
Good evening, Dr. Crane.

500
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,789
Dr. Sternin.

501
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,291
It's, uh, nice to see you again.

502
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:36,792
And you.

503
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,296
I apologize for my overzealous
behavior this afternoon.

504
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,798
And for making fools of us both.

505
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,299
Yes, well, I would also like

506
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,801
to apologize for my completely

507
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,302
unprofessional attitude, and

508
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:48,303
I promise you that

509
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,305
that sort of thing
will never happen again.

510
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:51,306
Fine.

511
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,808
I've already penned a letter

512
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,810
to the American Psychiatric Association

513
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,311
apologizing for my behavior.

514
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,697
I would suggest that you do likewise.

515
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,948
Of course, of course.

516
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,949
And I think

517
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,902
perhaps for the sake of our
professional reputations,

518
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,405
it's best we put this matter behind us

519
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,906
and go on with our lives.

520
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,291
Oh.

521
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,542
That is probably wise.

522
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,544
You see, I've already
lost three patients

523
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,413
as a result of today's fiasco.

524
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,664
That's odd.

525
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:17,049
I picked up three.

526
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
While we're on the subject,
Dr. Crane, I suggest

527
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,473
that your behavior indicates
an unacceptable level

528
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,475
of sexual frustration.

529
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,978
You strike me as a man who
needs professional help.

530
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,980
Or perhaps a girlfriend.

531
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,483
And you strike me as a woman

532
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,485
who could use a good cuffing.

533
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,487
Good day, Dr. Crane.

534
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,988
Good day, Dr. Sternin.

535
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,991
Uh, just a moment, Dr. Sternin.

536
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,992
Um...

537
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,746
Sam, isn't the refrigerator
door stuck again?

538
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,031
I don't think so. Oh,

539
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,415
I think it is.

540
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,783
And we need a hairpin

541
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,669
to open it up. Dr. Sternin,

542
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,420
could we borrow a hairpin?

543
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,422
I don't see how a hairpin will help.

544
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,207
Strangely enough, it does.

545
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:00,208
FRASIER: Oh, well,

546
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,710
don't you see?

547
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,711
What these

548
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:06,214
two people who are
such geniuses at romance

549
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,716
are trying to do

550
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,218
is to get you to take your hair down,

551
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,220
thinking that it will stimulate me

552
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,222
like some sort of Pavlovian dog.

553
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,727
So, why don't you just

554
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,729
oblige them, get this
silliness over with

555
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,230
so we can get on with our lives?

556
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,232
(sighs)

557
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,738
You mean like this?

558
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:32,240
Precisely.

559
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,210
You know what?

560
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,712
What?

561
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm going to kiss you.

562
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,498
I'm going to

563
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,000
kiss you hard, and I'm
going to kiss you long.

564
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,004
But make no mistake about it,

565
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,506
I am going to kiss you.

566
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,641
In fact, I'm going to kiss
you like you've never...

567
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,147
(sighs)

568
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,649
Yes, like that.

569
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,650
Now listen, Lilith, I think

570
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,652
you and I have just been
too articulate for words.

571
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,654
We talk and we talk, and
what we really want to do

572
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,156
is show how we feel.
I think, Dr. Crane...

573
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,157
Look, I don't care what you think!

574
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,658
We both want to be animals.

575
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,026
Now I'm going back to my tastefully

576
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:08,994
decorated townhouse

577
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,495
and prove it.

578
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,998
Well, I-I suggest you come with me.

579
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,001
I think I see what you're trying

580
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,503
to do, Dr. Crane, and I
just want you to know...

581
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,872
it worked.

582
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,674
Let's go.

583
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,847
Isn't it exciting to see the blush

584
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,349
of new-found love on their faces?

585
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,850
Do you realize

586
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
we've just seen the birth of

587
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,104
a new ro... Don't you
have someplace to go?

588
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,307
Oh, yes.

589
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:41,777
The concert.

590
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,029
By myself.

591
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,116
I'll go.

592
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,453
And sure, I'll be
alone, but I don't care.

593
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,455
Because I'm in love.

594
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,207
And no one who's

595
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,959
truly in love can ever be alone.

596
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,462
And I know my fellow loves me.

597
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,464
He just doesn't know it yet.

598
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,833
So I'll go to this concert,

599
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,170
listen to the music, and
dream again of the day

600
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,173
when he'll be sitting beside me,

601
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,175
holding my hand,

602
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,677
sharing the moment.

603
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:16,928
That's my dream,

604
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,231
and mine alone.

605
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,098
And no one can...

606
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,434
Get her out of here!

607
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,021
I'll go.

608
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,907
Only if you really want to.

609
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,611
But this is not a date.

610
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,862
The fact that we sit together

611
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,614
has nothing to do with anything.

612
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,915
We're gonna take separate cabs.

613
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,917
I will not talk to you
during the intermission.

614
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,918
I'm not gonna take you

615
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,420
anywhere afterwards,

616
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,422
and we will not mention
this ever again, okay?

617
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,923
Fine.

618
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
Okay.

619
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,427
Is that love, or what?
