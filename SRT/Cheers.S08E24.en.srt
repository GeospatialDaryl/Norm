00:00:04,487 --> 00:00:06,021
well, i've gotta run home

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:07,588
and be a father                
 for about an hour.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,507
Where's lilith?

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:10,959
Noted research psychologist

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:13,494
dr. Lilith sternin-crane

7
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:14,762
has a singing lesson.

8
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,531
Lilith sings?

9
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:18,416
Well, it seems it's always     
 bothered my dear heart

10
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:19,768
that she cannot sing.

11
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,303
As if that were                
 her only character flaw.

12
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:25,089
And now with the baby,         
 she'd like to be able          
 to sing him a lullaby

13
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:28,827
without frightening            
 4 years of growth              
 out of him.

14
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:30,829
Don't put lilith down      
     for wanting to sing.

15
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:31,930
I think it's cool.

16
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:33,297
You do?                
                 Yeah.

17
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:35,399
I remember when i was 14,

18
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,201
i sang the lead            
     in my school choir.

19
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:39,437
It was one of the              
 happiest times of my life.

20
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,756
Yeah, it made me           
     the most popular girl      
     in school.

21
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,258
Really?

22
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,677
Of course, i never             
 wore anything under my robe.

Hey, rebecca left a message    
 for you about some

terry who wants                
 to meet with you

34
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,699
about an ad                
     in the paper.

35
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,901
Oh, yeah, i'm advertising  
     for a roommate.

36
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:46,270
My landlord            
         just raised my rent.

37
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,872
Well, why don't you just move?

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,574
Are you kiddin'?        
        I love my neighborhood.

39
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,342
It's so quiet there.

40
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,961
Especially since the gangs 
     started using silencers.

41
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:55,380
Huh?

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,383
Hey, well,                  
    a great neighborhood        
    just got even greater, huh?

43
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,820
And you be careful             
 when you pick roommates now.

Being an old ballplayer,

     bring the girls in         
     at all hours...

48
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:14,065
now, these are the fun guys,   
 these are the guys you want.

Oh, woody. I'm terry gardner.

 for a roommate.

Oh, w-when i heard     
         the name terry,

54
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,531
i automatically assumed 
        it was a guy.

55
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,233
Oh, well, if it bothers you    
 that i'm not a guy,            
 you know--

56
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:36,438
no, no, no, no, no, don't go   
 having some big expensive      
 operation for me.

57
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,609
No, i meant that               
 i would understand.

58
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:42,710
Oh, right.

59
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,278
Well, listen,          
         you came all this way,

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,513
why don't              
         you just sit down?

61
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,549
I'd better hear you out.       
                 Ok.

62
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,651
All right, well,           
     let me tell you            
     about myself.

63
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,869
Ok.

64
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,538
I'm originally from indiana.

65
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:56,241
I'm a dental assistant,        
 i love to cook.

66
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,542
What else can i tell you?

67
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,827
My daddy is a minister.

68
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,312
Will you excuse me 
             for a moment?

69
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,480
Sure.

70
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,150
Hey, guys.

71
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:07,218
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

72
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,487
She seems like             
     the perfect roommate.

73
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,740
But i don't know, i mean,  
     the thought of havin'      
     a girl for a roommate...

74
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:15,743
well, i got a real problem 
     with that.

75
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:17,745
Girlfriend wouldn't        
     understand, huh?

76
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,564
Hmm.                    
         Now i got 2 problems.

77
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,169
Oh, i get it, i get it.        
 Your mom would disapprove.

78
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,987
Make that 3 problems.

79
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,323
What, do you have           
    religious scruples?

80
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:31,259
Oh, great. 4 problems.

81
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,847
What was your original      
    problem, woody?

82
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:37,282
Well, i like to        
         sit on the couch

83
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,217
and leave the top button   
     of my pants undone

84
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,353
after a good frozen meal.

85
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,572
(Woody)                    
     i mean, i--i don't think   
     kelly would mind.

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,674
If i'm not sleeping 
            with her,

87
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,458
why would i be sleeping 
        with someone else?

88
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,761
Whoa, wait a minute.

89
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,664
You've been goin' out          
 with kelly for over a year,

90
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,532
and you're not                 
 sleeping with her?

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,868
Of course not.             
     That's the sort of thing   
     you wait to do

92
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,253
after you're married.  
         Right, mr. Peterson?

93
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,539
Oh, you keep           
         believing that, woody.

94
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,827
All right,         
             i made up my mind.

95
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:10,982
Terry, you can move in.

96
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:12,116
Oh, great.

97
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,486
All right,          
            here's an envelope.

98
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:17,671
It has my address  
             and 3 keys in it.

99
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,974
All right, one of the keys 
     is for the doorknob,

100
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,543
one is                 
         for the security bolt,

101
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,944
and one is         
             for the deadbolt.

102
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,379
You can never be   
             too careful.

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,997
Won't you need a key?

104
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,314
No, i left the window open.

105
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:28,382
Oh.

106
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:31,652
[Gasps]

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,754
oh.

108
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,690
Oh. Oh.

109
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:37,959
What? What?                    
 What are you looking at?

110
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:41,096
It's robin colcord     
         and that little tramp  
         he's been seeing.

111
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,098
Oh, there's a picture          
 of you in the paper?

112
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,519
No.

113
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,854
It's that little           
      <i>charge d'affaires</i>         
    <i> from the french consulate.</i>

114
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,924
Rebecca, i must tell you,      
 this is not healthy            
 relationship you're in.

115
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,009
I mean, stuck in a runoff      
 with another woman

116
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,662
for robin colcord's        
     affections.                
     It's demeaning.

117
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,597
Although it's nothing

118
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,131
compared to what i'd do        
 to have                        
 this exquisite creature

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,467
grind her heel             
     into my forehead.

120
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,868
My god!

121
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,937
Wow, look at that.

122
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:09,040
Boy, i've never seen       
     anything quite like that.

123
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,559
Come on, now.          
         How hot could she be?

124
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,962
[Sobbing]

125
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,332
oh, give me that.

126
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,667
You guys, she's not        
     that good-lookin'.

127
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:21,736
Oh, no. I'll show you      
     how good-lookin' she is.

128
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:24,689
Barry. Barry,      
             what do you think  
             of this babe?

129
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,858
I'd switch.

130
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,897
I hate her.

131
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,165
I wish she was dead.

132
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,367
What is she doing here?    
     This is my town.

133
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,670
Jean-marie is here         
     for some franco-american   
     trade celebration.

134
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,107
All of boston's elite  
         is gonna be there.

135
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,109
Plus one frog slut.

136
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,912
Jean-marie.

137
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,816
Oh, the name just glides    
    off the tongue.

138
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,685
Of course, i hope              
 it doesn't do that tonight

139
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,603
when i'm in the rack       
     with lilith.

140
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,592
Jean-marie. I don't think  
     that's such a hot name.

141
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,760

00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:46,837
I, um...

278
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:51,309
i want to be as good   
         in bed as jean-marie.

279
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,476
Are we out of vermouth?

280
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:53,627
No.

281
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,847
All right, class,          
     so you want to learn

282
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,017
all about the wonderful    
     art of love, eh?

283
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,185
[Clears throat]

284
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,154
now, you're gonna need      
    lab partners for this. Hmm?

285
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:05,672
There's an odd number       
    of you.

286
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,674
I guess the professor's        
 gonna have to participate.

287
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:10,378
Sam, be serious.       
         Come on, this means    
         a lot to me.

288
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:12,380
All right, all right,          
 all right.

289
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,131
Just tell me.

290
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,482
What was the first thing    
    she did

291
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,551
when you got               
     into her bedroom?

292
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:19,603
Actually, we never         
     got to the bedroom.

293
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:22,306
You did it in the hall?

294
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,324
No. What kind of woman     
     do you think she is?

295
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:26,244
We did it in the elevator.

296
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:27,711
The elevator?

297
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,315
Yeah. I mean,                  
 i was afraid at first, myself,

298
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,817
being in a public place     
    like that, but she was--

299
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,753
but she was so insistent.

300
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,138
She said the danger            
 would heighten                 
 the excitement of it all.

301
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,906
She kept                
        whispering in my ear

302
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:41,875
and saying                 
     we could be discovered     
     at any second.

303
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:42,909
[Sighing]

304
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,278
amazing stuff.

305
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,013
I mean, at first,              
 you know, i was against it.

306
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,849
"It" being the rail.

307
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,771
But then, uh,

308
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,308
then, before i knew            
 what was happening, she, uh,

309
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,310
she took this scarf            
 from around her hair,

310
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,778
and she--she, uh,              
 wrapped it around my wrist

311
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,381
[chuckling]                    
 and tied me to the rail.

312
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,016
Oh.

313
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,252
I said,                        
 "hey, what are you doin'?"     
 She just-- she just laughed.

314
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,588
I tell you. I've never felt    
 so powerless and in control

315
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,624
at the same time.

316
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:14,958
Wow.           
         Yeah.

317
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,029
Then she leaned in closer

318
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,830
and we started to--

319
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,332
miss howe,                  
    we're out of vermouth.

320
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,221
No, we're not, woody.          
 Get out of here, man.

321
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,856
Well, where is it, sam?

322
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,825
The matinee just let out,  
     and there's a busload      
     of old ladies

323
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,110
screaming for martinis.

324
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,929
Wood, there's a--              
 there's a case of it

325
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,015
on the 2nd shelf               
 in the storeroom, all right?

326
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,469
Ladies, put the mailman down.

327
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,288
Sam, you were right.   
         This isn't gonna work. 
         Yes, no--

328
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,073
no, you have to show me.

329
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,942
What?

330
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,011
I love robin and i need him.

331
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,746
And i'll do anything       
     to keep him.

332
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:55,649
Oh, yeah.      
 I need to be as good in bed    
 as that french girl or better.

333
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:56,984
I need to experience           
 everything

334
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,486
just the way you               
 and jean-marie did.

335
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,220
In the hotel, the scarf,

336
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,655
the elevator.              
            The elevator?

337
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:04,992
Yes! That's the only way       
 i'm gonna learn, i guess.

338
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,260
I am going to get my car.      
                    Now?

339
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,996
Ok, maybe we should        
     think this over.

340
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:11,481
No, no, no. Thinking is bad.   
 Go, go, go, go.

341
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,784
Thank you, sam. Thank you.

342
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,419
You're welcome.        
         You're welcome.

343
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,905
Ooh. Oh, god--

344
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:19,306
[exclaims]

345
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:22,460
did she fall for it?

346
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:23,543
Hook, line, and

347
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:26,564
[clicking tongue]  
             sammy.

348
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,766
I don't know.              
     Do you believe this?

349
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,618
Did you ever think             
 this day would come?

350
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:33,053
As a matter of fact,       
     i, uh, never had           
     any doubt here, carla.

351
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,188
Behold this sealed envelope.

352
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,258
Will you please open it 
        and read the contents?

353
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:39,560
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,532
"I, sam malone,                
 will sleep with rebecca howe

355
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,635
on the night               
     of april 19th, 1990."

356
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,503
When did you write this?

357
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:51,722
This morning.                  
 I write a new one every day.

358
00:14:57,912 --> 00:14:59,229
[People chattering]

359
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:02,099
woody, i'll have   
             a cup of java

360
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,001
and an iced tea for--

361
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:08,639
what did you say       
         your name was again?   
         Uh, liza minnelli?

362
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,175
(Lilith)                       
 why all this resentment        
 over my singing lessons?

363
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,026
Is it jealousy             
     over my desire

364
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:15,262
to strengthen                  
 the mother-child bond?         
                 True.

365
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:17,581
Reluctance to part             
 with even a few hours

366
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,551
of your precious freedom,      
 or is it merely                
 that you're a jerk?

367
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:23,553
(Cliff)                    
     hey, look at this, normie.

368
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,323
Yes.               
     It's the, uh, nightingale.

369
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,959
You told them                  
 about my singing?

370
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:33,830
Well, everyone was asking   
    why my hair was falling out 
    in clumps. Yes.

371
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:37,434
So, uh, ahem, how are          
 the, uh, singing lessons       
 coming, huh?

372
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:39,203
Just fine, thank you.  
    Oh, yeah?

373
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,038
Oh, now, lilith,           
     you're being too modest.

374
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,073
They're going  
                 splendidly.

375
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,042
Why just this afternoon     
    lilith received

376
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,011
a romantic proposition     
     from a young moose.

377
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,380
Oh.                 
                 Yeah.

378
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,648
From, uh, northern quebec, 
     wasn't it, dear?

379
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,950
I mean, you were           
     pointed in that direction, 
     weren't you?

380
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,052
[Cliff braying]

381
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,686
jest if you will,

382
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,622
but it takes a certain         
 amount of courage

383
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,158
to expose one's inner soul     
 through vocalization.

384
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,427
Especially             
         with that ahooga horn  
         you call a voice.

385
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,263
[All laughing]         
             oh, now, stop it,  
             all of you!

386
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,464
I've had enough of this.

387
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,033
You don't know     
             how well i sing.

388
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,867
You've never       
             even heard me.

389
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,936
Well, you should give us       
 a little demonstration there,  
 lilith.

390
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,005
[Laughing]                     
                do you think    
                i am ashamed?

391
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:17,240
You want this opportunity  
     to make more fun of me?

392
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,877
We were hoping, yeah.

393
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,879
Well,                      
     i rise to your challenge.

394
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,547
What's with the...

395
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,349
i'm going to sing          
     frederick's favorite song

396
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,552
hmm.                           
     Made famous by al jolson.

397
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,720
We ain't heard 
                 nothin' yet.

398
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,288

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,377
¶ sonny boy                
         i'm going to go rent   
          <i>the jazz singer.</i>

415
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:35,269
Lilith, i apologize.   
         That was just lovely.

416
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:39,106
I've never heard your voice 
    filled with such tenderness 
    and emotion.

417
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:42,442
Why--                  
         why have you never     
         sung to me like that?

418
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,579
Because your breath            
 doesn't smell like cookies.

419
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,768
No, ma, cliff--            
     cliff clavin.

420
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,770
Hey, woody.

421
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,538
Hey, terry,                 
    what are you doin' here?

422
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,407
I just wanted                  
 to give you back your keys.    
 I'm moving out.

423
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,126
What's the matter? 
             What did i do?

424
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,194
Nothing. You couldn't have     
 been a better roommate.

425
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:04,298
You left me alone,             
 which is just what i needed.   
 I had time to think.

426
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:07,267
I've decided i am going        
 back to my husband.

427
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,568
Husband?

428
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:10,137
Yeah, we had a big fight       
 yesterday.

429
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,604
I needed someplace to stay.

430
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:14,107
See, we were arguing again     
 over his over his awful temper

431
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:17,244
and his fits of crazy,         
 jealous rage.

432
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,712
But we worked it all out.

433
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:24,267
By the way, woody,             
 he wants to meet the guy       
 i spent the night with.

434
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:27,170
Oh, well,           
            god, i'd love to,   
            but i, uh...

435

you know, this is my break,

436
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,608
and i usually like to      
     spend this time

437
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,676
running as fast as i can.

438
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,881

Oh, you know my husband.   
     I'll go wait in the truck.

442
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,539
Hey, woody, i heard         
    you moved out here          
    and became a bartender.

443
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,041
Is that true?          
                 Yeah.

444
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,910
[Chuckles]                     
 we didn't believe it.          
                 Yeah.

445
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:52,212
Somebody's daddy

Oh, you're in great shape.

447
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:55,916
Oh, yeah.

448
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,969
You know, this guy     
         once lifted a tractor  
         off a guy's leg.

449
00:18:59,037 --> 00:18:59,970
Wow.

450
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,088
And put it on his throat.

451
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,923
[Chuckles]

452
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:06,243
well, uh, i'd like to spend    
 all day here

453
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,146
but, uh, i gotta find          
 the guy who spent              
 last night with my wife.

454
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,515
Just bash in his brains.

455
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,467
Do you know who it is?

456
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,904
Mr. Clavin,                    
 we're still friends and all    
 but run.

457
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,006
What?

 stranded between here?

465

 by the, uh, penthouse area.

468

And we worked our way down.

Oh.

Oh, we--we don't have to do    
 that scarf thing.

Well, if you wanna pretend,

     that the only reason       
     you asked me here

532

was so that you could

how did you find out       
     about the water pipe?
