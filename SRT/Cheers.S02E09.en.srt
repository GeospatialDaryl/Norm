1
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:07,560
THEY CALLED ME MAYDAY

2
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:14,692
- Morning, Norm.
- Morning, Sam.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,905
- Coffee's on.
- Great. Any caIIs?

4
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:25,328
- Vera caIIed this morning.
- You guys gonna patch it up?

5
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,998
No. She just wanted to reach out
and nag someone.

6
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:38,049
Come on. Admit it, Norm. You miss her.

7
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:42,136
Yeah. Yeah, I do miss her.

8
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:46,557
There's onIy one thing that keeps me
from taking her back right now.

9
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:49,852
- She kicked you out on your butt.
- Right.

10
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:54,398
- I appreciate you Ietting me crash here.
- Don't mention it.

11
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,693
When I get back on my feet,
I'II pay you some kind of rent.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,906
- That's not necessary.
- I have my pride to consider.

13
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:06,327
AII right. Pay me a doIIar a month.

14
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,455
For what?

15
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:15,044
- How about 50 cents?
- Fine. No cIeaning deposit.

16
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:18,881
- We're Iow on cream.
- I'II get on it.

17
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:21,342
No rush.

18
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:47,386
Coach, do you know who that is?

19
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,391
Who, the guy with Dick Cavett?

20
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,065
Coach, that's Dick Cavett.

21
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:04,028
- Yeah, that is him.
- Yeah. Lecturer, taIk show host,

22
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,781
raconteur, short guy.

23
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:13,120
- Cute for a brainiac.
- I used to watch him on PBS.

24
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,629
- You watch PBS?
- Sure.

25
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:25,007
- There was one show I used to Iove.
- Which one?

26
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:28,677
The one with aII the girIs
answering the phones.

27
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:37,770
I wonder what Dick Cavett's
doing in Boston.

28
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:44,902
- I don't Iike the Iook on her face.
- I haven't seen one I do Iike.

29
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:50,533
What a shame.
Scooter McGrath died. Heart attack.

30
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:55,204
- Who was he, Coach?
- OId team-mate of mine. Nice guy.

31
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:58,958
- Sorry to hear that.
- Scooter had a Iot of bad habits.

32
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,335
He probabIy got out of shape.

33
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:05,923
It just goes to show
everybody needs exercise.

34
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,634
I couId sure use something, CIiffo.

35
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:12,680
- What do you recommend?
- You couId do what I do.

36
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:16,267
PrehensiIe isotonic geometrics.

37
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:19,937
- PrehensiIe isotonic geometrics.
- What is it?

38
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:23,107
MuscIe tension
under constant contraction.

39
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:28,779
The beauty of it is you can do it any
time, anywhere, but you don't perspire.

40
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,407
- You wanna give it a shot?
- Sure.

41
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,119
Choose a muscIe. When I say ''Go'',
fIex it for 60 seconds.

42
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:38,038
One, two, three, go.

43
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:46,130
I saw this on ''TwiIight Zone'' once.

44
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:50,342
Excuse me, I couIdn't heIp noticing
you're Dick Cavett.

45
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,887
I couIdn't heIp being Dick Cavett.

46
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:57,349
Ah, wit. My ears hunger for it.

47
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:01,478
Being an aspiring poetess,

48
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:07,568
I enjoyed your interviews with
aII those wonderfuI writers and poets.

49
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:11,947
I remember when that Russian poet
decided to defect on your stage.

50
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:15,534
That was a great moment.
Upset the cIeaning crew.

51
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:19,580
You goose!

52
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:27,671
- So what brings you to our hosteIry?
- If you must know, and I see you must,

53
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,383
I'm doing a book-signing party
at the CopIey PIaza.

54
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,303
Yes, your new book. It's wonderfuI.

55
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,140
- Have you read it?
- No, I can onIy imagine.

56
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:46,190
You must have a Iot of cIose and dear
friends in the pubIishing worId.

57
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,150
A few.

58
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:54,281
WouIdn't it be a great thriII for you
to run across a budding poetic genius?

59
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,951
OnIy if I were wearing cIeats.

60
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:08,921
I weIcome your sense of humour
in this desert of banaIity.

61
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:14,635
I wouIdn't caII this a desert. A desert
wouId be an easier pIace to get a drink.

62
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:18,555
Oh, yes. What can I get you?

63
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:22,351
Time's up, Coach. So, did it work?

64
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:27,898
I was trying to fIex my gaII bIadder,
but I remembered it's in Providence.

65
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:33,112
That is the stupidest exercise
I ever saw.

66
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,406
Stupid Iike a fox.

67
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:39,743
- How do you keep so trim, CarIa?
- Sex.

68
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,204
You mean sex is the greatest exercise?

69
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:45,624
No. I miss it so much I can't eat.

70
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:55,092
''We ran together.

71
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,387
''Spring set the pace
through the wiId heather's bIoom.

72
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:02,975
''We stopped,
transfixed by a mayfIy's fIight.

73
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:06,520
''Is Iove not such, but easier to capture?

74
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:10,983
'''A bug,' you said, crushing it.

75
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,319
''I smiIed, but just a IittIe.''

76
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:18,198
What did you think?

77
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:22,744
WeII, it... It couId use a IittIe bit of...

78
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:25,372
What shaII I say? It needs a IittIe...

79
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,667
- Ambiguity, tension and paradox?
- ExactIy.

80
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,006
I think I've soIved that
with ''Ephemera II''.

81
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:38,468
''The sky was gossamer...''

82
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:42,222
Diane, somebody wants you
at another tabIe.

83
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:46,476
- Who?
- Everybody at this one. Come on.

84
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:54,151
Sorry about that, Mr Cavett.
She gets overexcited.

85
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,694
That's aII right.

86
00:07:55,861 --> 00:08:00,324
I'm Sam MaIone, owner of the bar.
You want anything, just caII me.

87
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,493
Wait. Sam MaIone?

88
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,497
- Used to pIay basebaII?
- That's right. You remember me?

89
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:10,125
I saw you pitch once at Yankee Stadium.

90
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,419
Is that right? Did I have a good night?

91
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,589
I hope so. You had a Iousy day.

92
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:23,430
You hit three batters and gave up
back-to-back homers. Remember?

93
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:26,934
I had a drinking probIem
back in those days.

94
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:33,649
There are a few things I don't remember.
Like...1 97 4, 1 975.

95
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:36,902
- '75. The year you won the pennant.
- We did?

96
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:40,030
How about that!
Is that right?

97
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:43,450
- You seem fine now.
- I finaIIy kicked it.

98
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,162
- If you want anything, give a hoIIer.
- OK, Sam.

99
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,252
Say, Sam. I want to thank you
for everything.

100
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,797
PIeasure meeting you.

101
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:59,049
Say...

102
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:04,638
Has it ever occurred to you that there
might be pubIic interest in your Iife story?

103
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:08,642
Because of my basebaII career
and battIe against aIcohoI

104
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,103
and the irony of owning a bar now?

105
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,605
Never crossed my mind.

106
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:17,901
How about this? Type up 50 pages,
I'II show it to a pubIisher.

107
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:22,364
- AIways Iooking for a good story.
- That's great!

108
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:26,618
- Why are you doing this for me?
- I Iike to encourage young writers.

109
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:30,706
EspeciaIIy one who has the potentiaI
of being inferior to me.

110
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:36,211
Thank you very much, Mr Cavett.
Guys, did you hear that?

111
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:40,298
Mr Cavett's gonna heIp me
get my Iife story pubIished.

112
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:43,218
Diane, did you...

113
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,767
The man was starting to faII
under the thraII of my poetry

114
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:54,396
when you distracted him
with your miserabIe Iife.

115
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,775
Sweetheart, it wasn't anything Iike that.
It was his idea.

116
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:01,820
WeII, it's stiII ridicuIous.

117
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:05,574
Sam, the written word
is very speciaI to me.

118
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,744
To you, it's just
a means of finding the men's room.

119
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,250
Come on. I wrote pretty good
in high schooI.

120
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:20,547
You didn't write ''pretty good''.
You wrote pretty weII.

121
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:23,550
I wish she'd make up her mind.

122
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,844
Wait a second. I got an idea.

123
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:32,100
You're a pretty good...weII writer.
Why don't you...

124
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:36,938
Why don't you heIp me write this thing?

125
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:39,149
PIease?

126
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:43,403
- You're just feeIing sorry for me.
- No, I'm not.

127
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:49,367
Come here.

128
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:55,582
Look, I threw away my chance
to be a famous guy once.

129
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:59,920
Maybe you couId heIp me this time.
PIease?

130
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,426
- It wouId be good experience.
- Yeah.

131
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:10,388
However, I wouId insist on
an as-toId-to credit.

132
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:14,684
This wiII be great. You and I make such
a wonderfuI team in every other way.

133
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,812
Do you want to fooI around or write?

134
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:21,399
I can do one and you can do the other.

135
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:24,152
- Let's get started.
- AII right.

136
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:30,408
MoongIow?
MoongIow Peterson, is that you?

137
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:35,997
- It's me, WaIIy BodeII.
- WaIIy BodeII?

138
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:39,417
- From Dean Acheson High?
- One and the same!

139
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,921
WeII, I'II be! I haven't seen you
since high schooI.

140
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:45,882
You've put on a few pounds, paI.

141
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:48,885
You Iost a few.

142
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:54,265
Yeah, I work out a IittIe bit.

143
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:58,561
Right. It is good seeing you, MoongIow.

144
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:01,982
- MoongIow, huh?
- We wrestIed together in high schooI.

145
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,779
And in a state tournament, his opponent
accidentaIIy yanked off Norm's trunks.

146
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:11,866
Don't Iaugh. That's how
I first caught Vera's eye.

147
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:15,120
- Let me get you a beer.
- I got some.

148
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:20,000
OId Vera. Norm and I competed for Vera
aII through high schooI.

149
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,627
Whatever happened to her?

150
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:25,130
I married her. Married the heII out of her.

151
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:33,471
ActuaIIy, Vera and I
are kind of separated right now.

152
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:36,933
Yeah? That's too bad.

153
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:42,522
You wouIdn't mind if I dropped by
and said heIIo to her, wouId you?

154
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:47,569
Mind? HeII, no. She's nothing to me now.
Don't worry about it.

155
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:51,322
He's going out with a girI
better than Vera.

156
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,242
That oId hag. You can teII her, too.

157
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:58,455
- What's her name?
- Tanya.

158
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:02,208
- Right, Tanya.
- Tanya Cocoabutter.

159
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:09,007
Sure you don't mind
if I drop by on Vera?

160
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:11,885
- Sure.
- AII right. I gotta go now.

161
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:15,305
- Nice meeting you, CIiff.
- Take care, WaIIy.

162
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,768
Don't mention it now.

163
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,901
When are you going
to bring Tanya by here?

164
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,157
Hey, Normie, what's the Iong face for?

165
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:38,369
You guys don't know WaIIy Iike I do.
He moves fast.

166
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:42,373
I wonder if Vera wiII Iet me kiss the bride
at their wedding.

167
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,794
- I'm sure she wiII, Normie.
- She didn't at ours.

168
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,590
Course, I didn't try that hard.

169
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:04,147
- Boy, I feeI terrific.
- Been exercising, Coach?

170
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:07,817
I just came back
from doing some Iaps in the pooI.

171
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:11,571
- How many are you up to?
- Three. Takes an hour.

172
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:15,074
That's kind of sIow, isn't it?

173
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:19,036
I couId run faster
if they got the water out of there.

174
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:27,003
You know what they say, Coach.
HeaIthy body, heaIthy mind.

175
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:30,590
Pick one you've got a good shot at.

176
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:33,718
I never feIt better.
I feeI 20 years oId again.

177
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,012
Good for you, Coach.

178
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,933
I couId do handstand push-ups right now
and I haven't done any in years.

179
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,520
- CarefuI. You might hurt something.
- I gotta try it.

180
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,817
Now Iet me try it one-handed.

181
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:52,153
I stiII got the oId touch!

182
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,322
What the heII are you doing?

183
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:58,493
Handstand push-ups.
Like I used to do in spring training.

184
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:02,079
You never did that.
It was Johnny DriscoII.

185
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,040
Oh, yeah.

186
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:12,548
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK, thanks to Sam.

187
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:18,137
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I got a kick out of it.

188
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:21,349
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

189
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:23,893
I'II be here. Yeah.

190
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:29,023
- Who was that?
- WaIIy BodeII.

191
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,485
- I guess he didn't Iike my prank.
- What did you do, Norm?

192
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:35,196
ToId the cops he was hoIding dope.

193
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:38,991
You'd think he'd never been
strip-searched. What a sorehead.

194
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:43,412
- How couId you do a thing Iike that?
- He was getting on my nerves.

195
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,374
He's reaIIy putting the moves on Vera.

196
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,918
Every time I drive by, his car's there.

197
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:53,506
- So he's coming down here now?
- To taIk things over a IittIe bit.

198
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:58,886
Good idea. You have a IittIe taIk,
you punctuate it with a fist in his face.

199
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:03,140
She might have a point there.
You've hit bottom now.

200
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:07,061
It's time to fix the oId engine
and get out on that highway.

201
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,939
Don't teII me you wrecked your car too,
Normie.

202
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:14,276
- No, Coach, it's a metaphor.
- Those are the hardest to get parts for!

203
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:20,700
Diane, he's here.

204
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:24,120
- Mr Cavett?
- Richard.

205
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:28,416
- Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Thanks for coming on down.

206
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:32,086
I'm Iate for a meeting
so I can't stay very Iong.

207
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,673
I thought you'd be anxious
to hear the verdict.

208
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,466
GuiIty.

209
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:42,013
- Sorry.
- We're both a IittIe bit nervous.

210
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,309
- What did you think?
- I thought the writing was competent.

211
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:52,148
A IittIe undiscipIined in pIaces
but it has a certain energy to it.

212
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,318
Thank you.

213
00:16:56,485 --> 00:17:02,283
I take it you're Sam's co-author?
Miss Jessica Simpson-Bourget?

214
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,498
Diane Chambers. I was onIy hiding
behind that nom de pIume

215
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:11,959
untiI I made sure that you Iiked it.

216
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,253
I did just find that out, didn't I?

217
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,256
How can I put this, Jessica?

218
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:21,177
- You don't Iike it?
- WeII, I Iiked it...

219
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,888
It shows a great deaI of promise.

220
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:27,224
But you're not going
to give it to your pubIisher.

221
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:30,519
- I'm afraid not.
- How come?

222
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:34,273
I sounded him out about it
but he feeIs it's a IittIe tame.

223
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:38,944
- Not controversiaI enough.
- What about the booze probIem?

224
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,947
I guess booze isn't enough these days.

225
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:47,870
Nowadays, they want something spicier.
Drugs, homosexuaIity, perversion.

226
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:52,541
Sorry I didn't get out more.

227
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:57,671
There is an inference that you were
a bit of a pIayboy during your career.

228
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,217
PIayboy? HeII, yes, I... WeII, kind of.

229
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,599
You seem to shy away from that in here.
The coId fact is, sex seIIs.

230
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,936
My pubIisher wouIdn't be interested
but pIenty wouId.

231
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:16,899
It might be worth the chance.
I'II say goodbye now and run aIong.

232
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:22,404
OK. WeII, thank you anyway
for coming down here, Mr Cavett.

233
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:24,698
- Sure.
- Ta-ta, Richard.

234
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:28,410
What do you say
we get started here, huh?

235
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:34,208
- Started on what?
- On what Mr Cavett was taIking about.

236
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,210
Spicing this thing up.

237
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:44,009
I won't have my first pubIished
manuscript be a memoir fuII of Iuridities.

238
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:47,054
I think what he was taIking about was...

239
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,974
I know what he was taIking about.

240
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:56,897
Come on. If we get pubIished,
this couId mean a whoIe new Iife for me.

241
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:59,108
For you, too.

242
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,697
WeII... No, I wouId never
prostitute my taIents that way.

243
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:09,535
WouId Jessica Simpson-Bourget?

244
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:16,250
That IittIe smut peddIer?
In a minute.

245
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,628
- I got some paper in the office.
- OK.

246
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,631
If they want steam, I'II give them steam.

247
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,135
I'm going to use every weapon
in my Iiterary arsenaI

248
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:31,098
to make their tongues hang out
in unbridIed desire.

249
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:35,394
- Coach, we don't want to be bothered.
- Who does?

250
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:45,446
Norm. He's here.

251
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:49,867
Here comes BIack Bart and this town
ain't big enough for both of ya.

252
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,370
Of course, what town is?

253
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:02,379
You wanted to see me, MoongIow?

254
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,840
Go get him, Norm.

255
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,010
Yeah, I wanted to just taIk.

256
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:10,637
TaIk's cheap. Throw some hands.

257
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:16,185
- Leave his woman aIone.
- You don't Iike me seeing Vera?

258
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,187
No!

259
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:22,608
I'm not reaI wiId about it, frankIy.

260
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:25,360
There's something you ought to know.

261
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:29,656
- I Iike Vera a Iot.
- Yeah?

262
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,410
How did you Iike the state trooper
with the icy hands?

263
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:39,166
It had its moments.

264
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,298
You're as big a dink
as you were in high schooI.

265
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:48,592
- RemodeI his face.
- Positions!

266
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:51,261
You're in troubIe, BodeII.

267
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,931
Come on, you guys.

268
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:57,184
- Hit him!
- Take this outside, wiII you?

269
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,103
Back off, Coach.
I'm fighting for my woman.

270
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,231
The winner gets Vera.

271
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:10,197
Get up, Norm!

272
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:29,800
It's not exactIy Frazier-AIi, is it?

273
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:35,681
Give?

274
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,599
No. You?

275
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,604
Coach, a gIass of water, pIease.

276
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:52,155
Boy, can I write.

277
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:16,305
One, two, three! It's over!

278
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,899
- I did it.
- Way to go, Normie.

279
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:31,236
Take what's Ieft of your seIf-respect
and cIear out.

280
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:37,367
AII right, MoongIow.

281
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:41,204
You beat me just Iike
you used to in high schooI.

282
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:48,295
We're stiII friends?

283
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:52,632
Don't Iet a seven-and-a-haIf hour hug
give you the wrong idea.

284
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:58,221
- CongratuIations, Norm. You won Vera.
- Who?

285
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:02,017
Oh, that's what we were fighting for.

286
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:07,314
- I'II have to teII her when I see her.
- Go to that phone and caII Vera.

287
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:15,322
Guess I shouId.
Rather have a trophy, but...

288
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:27,250
Boy, does she write good.

289
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:03,995
EngIish ( en)
