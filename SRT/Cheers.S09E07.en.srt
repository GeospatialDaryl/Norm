2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,800
     Sam.                       

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,200
                    Ha!         

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,500
                Doug Aducci.    

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,700
        Hey, guys, look at this.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,900
It's Doug Aducci,               

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,000
    one of the best damn umpires
         in the American League.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,300
And, uh, Sam here               
was one of the best, uh,        

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
groomed pitchers                
in the American League, huh?    

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,800
SAM:                            
Sit down here.                  

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,900
                    God, I can't
                believe this.   

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,100
    Last time I saw this guy,   

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,500
we were playing                 
the Yankees.                    

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,400
You were behind the plate,      
ninth inning.                   

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
I was on the mound,             
up by one.                      

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
He calls ball four              
on Munson.                      

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,700
Next guy up                     
is Chambliss,                   

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,200
knocks one                      
right out of the park.          

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,600
Not that I care, man, but,      
you know, that was a strike.    

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,600
            No, if I called it a
    ball, it was a ball, Sam.   

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,600
(chuckles)                      

22
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,200
It was right                    
at the knees.                   

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,400
          It must have been low.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,600
No, no, man, you gave me        
the same pitch on Roy White.    

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,900
             That was 1975, Sam.

26
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,300
                It's over.      

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,000
The point is that Chambliss     
should never have come up.      

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,800
                 Look, Malone, I
            said it was over!   

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,400
All I'm asking, Aducci--        
if that's your real name--      

30
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,100
is that you be consistent,      
for God's sake!                 

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,600
I mean, that was                
my livelihood!                  

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
          That's enough, Malone!

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
                Go get my drink!

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, get your own drink!        

35
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,000
                What?!          
     You heard--                

36
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,500
What, are you hard              
of hearing, too?!               

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,300
            That's it! You're   
                    out of here!

38
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,500
You'd throw me out              
for that?!                      

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,700
                    Take a hike,
              Malone, right now!

40
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
I'll take a hike,               
but not before I do this!       

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,100
You stupid--                    
I can't believe it!             

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,800
    (grunting angrily)          

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,200
 Eh, it may have been a strike. 

44
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,100
          I was going           
  through a divorce that year.  

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,300
      (theme song begins)       

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,700
 Takes everything you've got  

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,400
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

49
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,900
 Sure would help a lot         

50
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,800
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

51
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,300
   Sometimes you want to go    

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,800
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

53
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,700
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

55
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,600
          The troubles         
    are all the same           

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,900
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,000
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
   People are all the same     

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,900
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Morning, everybody.             

62
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

63
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,900
              Hey, Mr. Peterson,
                      what's up?

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,700
The warranty on my liver.       

65
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,300
Oh, Sammy, this town is going   
     down the tubes, I tell you.

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,500
Why do you say that?            

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,500
        Well, they're installing
        parking meters up there.

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
      Yeah, I'll have to carry a
      big pocket full of change.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,600
             It's gonna ruin the
            line of my pants.   

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Have to go up there every two   
hours, feed the damned meter.   

71
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,400
Well, you want me               

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,700
to tell you when two hours      
is up, Mr. P.?                  
                             No,

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,700
    I'll know, Woody.           

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,900
         Every 87 sips.         

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
(door opens)                    

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,800
I don't accept                  
that, Frasier.                  

77
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
This shouldn't                  
be happening.                   

78
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,100
      Well, Lilith, I warned you

79
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,800
            on the night that we
      conceived little Frederick

80
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,200
      that raising a child would
  not be all roses and rainbows.

81
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,400
No, as I recall,                

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,800
the exact words you uttered     
that night were,                

83
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,500
"Who cares                      
about the next 20 years?        

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's get nasty."               

85
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,900
        It's just like you to   
         miss the inner meaning.

86
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,800
         You guys okay?         

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,700
      Well, we've just received 
    some very sobering news.    

88
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,100
        Well, you're going to   
         have to feed that meter

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,100
             just like everybody
                else, Dr. Crane.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,900
Yes, Woody.                     

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Well, the other thing           
that has us so distraught       

92
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,800
is our son's development.       

93
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,300
Frederick is                    
nearly a year old               

94
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
and has yet                     
to speak his first word.        

95
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,400
Since we were both              
so concerned,                   

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
we decided to have our little   
man evaluated by a colleague    

97
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,500
who specializes                 
in child development.           

98
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,700
    Oh. What'd he say?          

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,900
                    He confirmed
                our worst fears.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,100
                    Frederick   
                  is... average.

101
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
              ALL:              
              Ooh.              

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Goodness.                       

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,700
It's not funny.                 

104
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,200
             Oh, really, Lilith.

105
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,600
  You didn't expect any sympathy
      here in Mayberry, did you?

106
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,900
Frasier, two people             
as gifted as we are             

107
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,800
were never meant                
to have an average baby.        

108
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,600
It's so unjust.                 

109
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,800
          Well, it's not the end
          of the world, my love.

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,300
            So he won't be as   
         erudite as his parents.

111
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
             He can still lead a
              happy, normal life

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,100
                like the rest   
                of these people.

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,200
                          And...

114
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,200
     the new record-- 53!       

115
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,600
                  Yes!          

116
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
Yeah.                           

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
        It's your fault, Lilith!
What?                           

118
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,600
         Yes, obviously you have
          an inferior gene pool.

119
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,800
    Me?                         

120
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,300
                  Well, I didn't
              have a grandfather

121
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,500
            who was a butter and
          egg man in New Jersey.

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Mother warned me                
you'd say you love me,          

123
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,900
but sooner or later,            
you'd bring that up.            

124
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,200
Lilith, Lilith, I'm sorry.      

125
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
My grandfather wasn't even      
    in America at that time.    

126
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
 If he had been, he wouldn't be 
    hawking butter and eggs.    

127
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,500
        Hi, guys.               

128
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
                            Hey.
                            Hey.

129
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,200
Oh, hi, Miss Howe.              

130
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,800
You got a letter here           
from Mr. Colcord.               

131
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
              Oh, thanks, Woody.

132
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,400
It smells                       
like cinnamon.                  

133
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
        Yeah, Robin's working   
              in the bakery now.

134
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
                 They put him in
          charge of sticky buns.

135
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
                    So what's   
                        the word

136
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,000
from our man                    
in the pokey?                   

137
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,600
                  "Dear Rebecca,

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,300
     "I miss you very much.     

139
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
"The days go by                 
so slowly here.                 

140
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,900
I lie on my cot                 
and dream about your..."        

141
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,600
Dream about your what?          

142
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,700
Face.                           

143
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,900
My smile,                       
my pleasant demeanor.           

144
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,600
         Come on.               

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
    What does it say?           

146
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
You guys,                       
this is private.                

147
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
I don't want                    
to read it to you.              

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
            I'd be happy with   
                 just the verbs.

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,900
          Hey, get a load       
    of this pencil sketch       

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,900
          of her demeanor.      

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
        Ooh.                    

152
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Come on, Carla.                 

153
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
How can life be                 
so unfair?                      

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,600
      They put this sweet,      
wonderful, dirty man behind bars

155
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
    without conjugal visits.    

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Three years                     

157
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,400
I saved myself                  
for a man                       

158
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
                    and what did
                  I end up with?

159
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
                     A two-month
                  window of sex.

160
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, you know, uh, when          
my brother was in the Army,     

161
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
he used to visit Amsterdam      
all the time.                   

162
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,800
He said they have a window      
of sex on every block.          

163
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,200
Yeah, I, uh,                    
I saved the letters.            

164
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,800
You might like them,            
Miss Howe.                      

165
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,100
         No thanks, Woody.      

166
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,100
Okay, Miss Howe.                

167
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,800
No hurry on those letters,      
Mr. Clavin.                     

168
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
              Frasier, would you
          like to hear my theory

169
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,300
             as to why Frederick
              is not progressing

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
        as well as he should?   

171
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,300
Something tells me              
I wouldn't, my love.            

172
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,000
Uh, Woody, uh,                  
two more drinks, please.        

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
            It's both our fault.

174
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,100
                  We don't spend
        enough time with him.   

175
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,500
                  We're too busy
            with our careers.   

176
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,900
            He's being raised   
            by a housekeeper.   

177
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,400
         There is no consistency
                    in his life.

178
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,100
  I agree, Lilith.              

179
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
  As you know,                  
  we rarely agree,              

180
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
as you're a behaviorist         
and I'm a strict Freudian,      

181
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
but it does make                

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,900
for some, some, some hot,       
angry sex in the boudoir.       

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
                    I don't have
                    to tell you.

184
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,200
                    (laughs)    

185
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,700
I wish you hadn't.              

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,100
            Let's face facts.   

187
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,700
            We should let the   
                 housekeeper go.

188
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,500
        One of us should be with
         our child at all times.

189
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
            The only question   
                  is: Which one?

190
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,700
Well, you, of course.           

191
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
              Why me, of course?

192
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,200
          Because I'm the woman?

193
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,600
        Why is the man's work   
automatically more important?   

194
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
                I'm making great
                breakthroughs   

195
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
                in my current   
            research project.   

196
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Yes, well,                      

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
damn me to an eternity          
driving a Yugo,                 

198
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,300
but I make                      
more money than you.            

199
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,600
    I write more books in one   
    year than you read, Frasier.

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,300
Yes, well,                      
I have many degrees.            

201
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
         Hey, hold it.          

202
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,700
      I-I'll settle this.       

203
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,900
  Let's pick an arbitrary way   
     to make the decision.      

204
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,800
     All right, whoever has     
 the most freckles on their arm 

205
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,800
stays home with the baby.       

206
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,500
    (sighs)                     

207
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,300
            I think that's an   
        excellent way to choose.

208
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,300
Oh, you would say that.         

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
You have no pigmentation        
in your skin.                   

210
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
            For God's sake, what
        are we arguing about?   

211
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
                 Who should stay
            home with our child?

212
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
          It's not a punishment,
                  it's an honor.

213
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,500
                  I'd love to.  

214
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
        I'd be delighted to stay
      home and nurture my child.

215
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,300
Oh, Lilith, you role-play       
the mother so well.             

216
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
                If we can't make
                    a commitment

217
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,700
            to be with our child
        at all cost, who can?   

218
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
    I agree.                    

219
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,800
The most important thing        
is to be with Frederick         

220
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,100
during his formative years.     

221
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,400
Say, I have a thought.          

222
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,300
In celebration                  
of this realization,            

223
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,800
we'll have dinner together      
tonight, just the two of us.    

224
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
                  And Frederick.

225
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,300
      Of course.                

226
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,600
Oh, oh,                         
did you want to come?           

227
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,100
     (laughs)                   

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,200
  Afternoon <i>again,</i> everybody.   

229
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,800
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

230
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
What'll you have                
this time, Norm?                

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,900
A cow, if I have to climb       
  those stairs one more time.   

232
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,600
              I am sick of this.

233
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,700
    Every two hours, it's up the
  stairs and down to the corner,

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,000
      over to the meter, put the
        coin, down the stairs...

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,100
At least you're getting         
exercise, huh, Mr. Peterson?    

236
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
    I get my exercise, Woody.   

237
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,800
    What, do you think          
  I just hop off the bar stool  

238
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,000
 and bam-- there's a bathroom?  

239
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
              No.               

240
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,700
          N-No, n-n-no, it's way
        down the hall, Woody.   

241
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
SAM:                            
Hey, Rebecca.                   

242
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,800
    Total up those receipts     
        from last night?        

243
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,100
Rebecca!                        

244
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
                         Huh?   

245
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,400
    Receipts.                   

246
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
                     Oh. No.    

247
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, it's 3:00.                

248
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,600
What have you been              
doing all day?                  

249
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
          I've been writing this
        reply to Robin's letter.

250
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Oh, come-- hey, write that      
on your own time,               

251
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,800
will you,                       
for goodness' sake?             

252
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,300
How are you going               
to get work done                

253
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,900
if all you do                   
is think about sex?             

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
              I don't know, Sam.
            How do you do it?   

255
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm a boy, it's my job.         

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
                  Fine, I'll get
                  your receipts.

257
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,900
                      (chuckles)
Sam, don't you think            

258
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,700
you were a little tough         
on Miss Howe?                   

259
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500
I mean,                         
she's hardly ever happy.        

260
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,700
So what                         
if she was late                 

261
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,100
totaling up                     
some dumb old receipts?         

262
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,100
         Oh, maybe you're right.

263
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,300
Maybe I was                     
a little tough on her.          

264
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,900
        Sam, is this all the    
              vermouth we have? 

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
Yeah, Rebecca was supposed      
to order some more.             

266
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
She probably forgot.            

267
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,500
                 Oh, well, now, 
              that's just tops. 

268
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,500
    Hey, Miss Howe, you were    
supposed to order more vermouth!

269
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,900
        We pay you              
     for an eight-hour day,     

270
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,700
     we expect eight hours!     

271
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,600
    Sometimes I wonder, Sam,    
    what are they thinking?     

272
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,900
Good afternoon, everyone.       

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
  Sam, just a quick iced tea.   

274
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
I've got my obsessive-compulsive
     group to preside over.     

275
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
        You can imagine         
     how punctual they are.     

276
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,200
                            SAM:
                             Ha.

277
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
    What time does it start?    

278
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,600
Well,                           

279
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
             now.               

280
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Boy, the next 15 minutes        

281
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
are really going                
to drive them bonkers.          

282
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,000
But that's exactly              
what they need.                 

283
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,500
                      Dr. Crane,
                        I've got

284
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,300
              some messages here
            from Mrs. Dr. Crane.

285
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,200
        Yes, Woody?             
                      Yes, well,

286
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
                      she called
                          to say

287
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,200
         she thinks Freddy might
              have a diaper rash

288
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,200
              and she can't find
             the A & D Ointment.

289
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,700
     And then she called back to
     say she found the ointment,

290
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,900
          but would it be better
        to use talcum powder?   

291
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,500
        Mm-hmm.                 

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
             And then she called
         back to say never mind,

293
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
        she's just gonna, uh,   
            leave the diaper off

294
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,200
              and let Freddy air
          out his little bottom.

295
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,600
             And then she called
                one last time   

296
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,600
                to ask where the
              carpet cleaner is.

297
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,500
      Oh, my God.               

298
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
                            SAM:
                Everything okay?

299
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,400
  Oh, everything's fine, Sam.   

300
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,200
          We just made          
     one horrible mistake.      

301
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,200
What's that?                    

302
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
    We left the child alone     
        with its mother.        

303
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,900
    Carla, you got a minute?    

304
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
    What do you need, Becks?    

305
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm trying to write             
an appropriate reply            

306
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,000
to Robin's letter.              

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,800
 Well, I don't seem to be able  
     to... express myself.      

308
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,900
                You want to send
                a "Smut-O-Gram."

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,300
And I was wondering             
if you could help me            

310
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,600
since you're the closest thing  
to a sailor I know.             

311
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,200
         Step into my office and
        rejoice in the filth.   

312
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,600
All right, so this              
is what I've got so far.        

313
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,900
"Dear Robin, I am writing you   
this letter while lying...      

314
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,400
    naked in the tub."          

315
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
      Let me just stop you      
          right there.          

316
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,800
  "I'm writing you this letter  

317
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,200
    while lying naked           
     on my kitchen table."      

318
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,500
        Whoa!                   

319
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,300
That is good.                   

320
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,900
             Well, there's a lot
                more depth to me

321
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,800
            than just being a   
             waitress, you know.

322
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,800
    Okay.                       

323
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,100
"Just thinking of you           
makes me hot.                   

324
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
It..."                          
Oh, no, no, no, no, not hot, no.

325
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,800
          Write this.           

326
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
Okay.                           

327
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,600
         "I'm on fire."         

328
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,500
          Fire.                 

329
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
                  "I'm churning,
                    I'm burning.

330
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,400
              "I want something,
                    anything.   

331
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,200
"I reach for a piece of fruit-- 

332
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,700
"an orange, a ripe orange,      

333
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,800
                 "big and sweet.

334
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,500
                    "I peel back
                     the skin...

            "slowly.

      "My fingernails tear      
         into the pulp.

The juice runs down my"...      

338
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,700
You know, that orange           
isn't going to work             

339
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,100
because the juice burns         
his ulcers.                     

340
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
                 Oh!            

341
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,600
Look, if you're not going       
to get into the spirit          

342
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,700
of soft porn,                   
just forget about it.           

343
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,100
    No, Carla, you're right.    

344
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
    I know. Who am I fooling?   

345
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
    I can't write this stuff.   

346
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,100
         Besides, what good     
         is a dirty letter?     

347
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,900
        Just fun words          
        on a piece of paper.    

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,900
You know,                       
you're right.                   

349
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
You need your man.              

350
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,000
We got to sneak you             
into that prison                

351
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
so you can get what you need.   

352
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,600
        Oh, that's a great idea.

353
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, let's go.                 
          Oh, but wait a minute,

354
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
          wait a minute, I don't
     know which cell is Robin's.

355
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,600
        How will we find him?   

356
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
  It has to be Robin?           

357
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,400
Th-There's lots of guys         
in there.                       

358
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
You might find someone          
you like better.                

359
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,000
Come on.                        

360
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,700
It's a minimum                  
security prison.                

361
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
How hard could it be?           

362
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,300
I mean you're allowed to visit  
him anytime you want, right?    

363
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,300
                     Yeah.      

364
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
So what you do                  

365
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,700
                is you find some
                  secluded spot.

366
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,900
Oh, you know, the garden area   
is usually deserted.            

367
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
                Great, great.   

368
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,000
                I'll stand watch

369
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,300
        and you can stay with   
        him as long as you want.

370
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,700
Oh, it shouldn't take long.     

371
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,900
      He's English.             

372
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
Sam, we're going to be gone     
for a couple hours.             

373
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,000
                Girl stuff.     

374
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
              Girl stuff? Why do
        they always say that?   

375
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
            What does that mean?

376
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,400
             Oh, Sam, I didn't  
            want to know that.  

377
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,200
        Greetings, all.         

378
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
The boys are out                
for an adventure.               

379
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
                            SAM:
                        Hey-hey!

380
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm glad to see you guys.       

381
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Has the little dude said        
his first word yet?             

382
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,300
      Well, I thought so,       

383
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
but then I checked my unabridged
Oxford English dictionary       

384
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,400
        and I was unable        
    to find the word "gak."     

385
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,900
Sam, may I have a beer,         
please,                         

386
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,000
and could you warm up this      
formula for my little angel?    

387
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,700
    (Frederick crying)          

388
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,900
Oh, pipe down!                  

389
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
                 You saw me give
              the bottle to Sam.

390
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,900
        Does, does water just   
             boil instantly? No!

391
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,800
         He'll warm it,         
      then you'll get it!       

392
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,100
And it'll be                    
yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.            

393
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
So, uh...                       

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
going a little rough there,     
Dr. Mom?                        

395
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,800
                     Well, let's
                        just say

396
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,300
  that since I have become the  
primary caregiver to Frederick, 

397
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,900
I have a newfound respect       
for those who have decided      

398
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
          to stay home          
    and dedicate their lives    

399
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
         to the raising         
    of their children.          

400
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,000
                     I have also
                        realized

401
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
    that if I were to do it     
    for any amount of time,     

402
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,100
  you would soon hear stories   
 of me sitting naked in a tower 

403
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
with a high-powered rifle.      

404
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,300
CLIFF:                          
Oh, yeah.                       

405
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,600
                    See, as a   
                 rule, your, uh,

406
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,300
                  psycho killers
            don't have families.

407
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,100
              Nah, they're, uh, 
                they're loners. 

408
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,100
    They may have jobs, they're 
         good to their mothers, 

409
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
              but, by and large,

410
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,500
              they sit alone at 
          night in a dark room, 

411
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,600
         writing their depraved 
        thoughts in a diary.    

412
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,800
Cliffie, you keep a diary,      
don't you?                      

413
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,200
            I, uh,              
    keep a journal, Norm.       

414
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,700
        A journal!              

415
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,300
      So does Lilith know       
    you guys are over here?     

416
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,900
    Oh, yes, of course, Sam.    

417
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,200
      I told her that I was just
    taking our 11-month-old baby

418
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
      out for a tall one.       

419
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,800
          The irony is          
 I got myself into this pickle. 

420
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,600
I convinced Lilith that with my 
background and clinical skills, 

421
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
  I should be the one to take   
primary care of the child,      

422
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
            not her.            

423
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
        Naturally,              
    she took it personally.     

424
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,200
I was somehow denigrating       
  her competency as a mother.   

425
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,500
    Boy, you look cross-eyed    
    at a woman these days...    

426
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
 So she <i>does</i> know you're here?  

427
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,100
         Well, no, no.          

428
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,900
  I didn't fill her in on our   
 itinerary for the entire day,  

429
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,100
     but she won't question     
          my judgment.          

430
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,100
    I have assumed complete     
  responsibility for the child  

431
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
 and I see no problem with him  
being in this environment.      

432
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,900
                      Hey, look,

433
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
with a cigar in his hand,       
he looks just like Baby Herman. 

434
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,100
If Lilith calls, we're not here.

435
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,500
Your Colcord                    
should be out here.             

436
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,400
                        REBECCA:
                     Oh, my God.

437
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,800
                    The whole   
                  prison's here.

438
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,200
What's going on?                

439
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,600
It's one                        
of our inmate's birthdays--     

440
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,100
Congressman Bailor.             

441
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
        He's hosting a little   
        barbecue for the men.   

442
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,700
                He's from Texas,
                    you know.   

443
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
                     Oh, man.   

444
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,000
          I don't think I can go
         through with this here.

445
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,800
         The thought of a lot of
people being a few feet away,   

446
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,100
              and somebody could
      discover us at any minute.

447
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
What, you're saying that        
like it's a bad thing.          

448
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,900
                Part of me wants
                    to stay here

449
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
              and the other part
             of me wants to run.

450
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,300
All of me wants                 
to strip down,                  

451
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,300
lay on the grass,               
and yell, "Fumble!"             

452
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
                      All right.

453
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,600
             I've come this far.

454
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,800
It wasn't the bad investments   
that ruined my S & L,           

455
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
             it was             
  the free checking accounts.   

456
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
                    Robin! Whoo!

457
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
Rebecca,                        
what a surprise.                

458
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,900
      Hello.                    

459
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh, have you met                
the boys?                       

460
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,600
            No, but I've seen   
            all of you on TV.   

461
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,000
     Yeah, uh, boys, would you  
    excuse us for a moment?     

462
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
        Darling.                

463
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,500
                    Robin, I got
                    your letter.

464
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,900
Oh, yeah,                       
I hope I didn't go too far.     

465
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
                    Did you mean
            everything you said?

466
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,300
  Every word.                   

467
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,500
And those little drawings       
in the margin, yeah.            

468
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,100
            Then I have got a   
            surprise for you.   

469
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,600
        Rebecca, wh-- there's   
          a party going on here.

470
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
                    Uh, darling.

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
                      Aah!      

472
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,900
Rebecca,                        
darling, darling.               

473
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,300
                No, no, no.     

474
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
W-W-We, we can't.               
It's not-- no, no, it's okay.   

475
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,800
     It's okay, no one will see.

476
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,100
     Carla's right over there on
  the other side standing guard.

477
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,700
            (laughs)            

478
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,800
Settle down, boys, settle down. 

479
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,300
Darling, darling,               
darling, you know--             

480
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
you know I want you             
more than anything,             

481
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
but we just                     
can't take the chance.          

482
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
                            Why?

483
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
                 I can be quiet.

484
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
(chuckling):                    
Quiet, no, no.                  

485
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,100
No, it's, it's not that--       

486
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,100
and I'd feel insulted           
if you were--                   

487
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,400
but I've just heard             
wonderful news.                 

488
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,300
I'm up for early parole         
next month.                     

489
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,500
                Oh! That's good!

490
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,900
You see,                        
so I can't do anything          

491
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,100
that would jeopardize that,     

492
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
um, and, well, this is one      
of the few rules, and, um,      

493
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
you know,                       
while I, I burn for you,        

494
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,900
I must adhere to it             
or I'll be here                 

495
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,100
for another year.               

496
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,400
Now, you do understand that,    
don't you?                      

497
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,100
                    Sure, I do. 

498
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
         You don't want to be in
          jail for another year.

499
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,200
                  But what about
                      my needs?!

500
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,100
                    Carla, we're
                    out of here!

501
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,300
(men groaning)                  

502
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,600
Gee whiz, Cliff,                
why don't you give it up?       

503
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,600
It's been an hour.              

504
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,100
Let's let Frederick             
have a chance.                  

505
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
                 No, if he wants
                to play with it,

506
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
    let him ask me himself.     

507
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,000
        Cliff, you know         
      he can't speak yet.       

508
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,200
     And what a cruel irony     
         that you can.          

509
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,500
SAM:                            
Norm.                           

510
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
It's 5:00,                      
time to feed the meter.         

511
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,900
                     Yeah, yeah,
            yeah, yeah, yeah.   

512
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
      I have had it, Sam.       

513
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,500
    No more of this climbing    
 up the stairs every two hours. 

514
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
                      You're not
                      leaving me

515
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,400
for another bar, are you?       

516
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,000
            Oh, no,             
I'm going to sell my car.       

517
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,900
                        FRASIER:
                5:00 already?   

518
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,600
We've been here all day.        

519
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,100
Time to get the little guy home,
        huh, Dr. Crane?         

520
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,300
                        Well,   

521
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,100
Lilith doesn't get home         
until 6:00.                     

522
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
Say, darts, anyone?             

523
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
              Paul?             
Yeah, sure.                     

524
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
    Cliff, you coming?          

525
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,700
                  Uh, yeah, I'll
                 be right there.

526
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,100
        (grunts angrily)        

527
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,900
      This thing's harder       
  than the civil service exam.  

528
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,800
     What a waste.              

529
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,800
                     Not for me.

530
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,000
                  I got 15 dates
                    lined up.   

531
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,200
              Of course, none of
          them start for a year.

532
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,900
I got no romance,               
no satisfaction, no nothing.    

533
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
              Come on, you don't
                have nothing.   

534
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,800
                 You got a purse
                full of ribs.   

535
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,800
          What?                 
                      Sure.     

536
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,600
              I took the liberty
              of filling you up.

537
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,500
             The sauce is in the
             change compartment.

538
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,400
                  Hey, cheer up.

539
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,900
             He said he'd be out
          in a couple of months.

540
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,600
     Yeah, sure, so what am     
  I supposed to do until then?  

541
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,800
                  Tell you what.

542
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,700
  There's, uh, some construction
        workers down the street.

543
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,800
                  What about you
              and I go cruising?

544
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,100
    (chuckles)                  

545
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,400
No, I can't cheat               
on Robin.                       

546
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,700
          Man, I thought we were
              going to be close.

547
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,800
  Well, maybe it wouldn't hurt  

548
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,600
 if we just paraded around them 
and frustrate them a little bit.

549
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
         There you go.          

550
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,300
Let's do it.                    
            All right.          

551
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,600
Let's spread                    
the pain around.                

552
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
Where are you guys going?       

553
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,700
             BOTH:              
          Girl stuff.           

554
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,400
                Ick!            

555
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,400
(door opens)                    

556
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,900
          Hello, Sam.           

557
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,700
          Hey, Lilith.          

558
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,300
Query: If I had a problem       

559
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,500
and needed to talk              
to someone about it,            

560
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,400
would it be perpetuating        
a stereotype                    

561
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
to actually select              
a bartender?                    

562
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,000
    Well, that, that depends.   

563
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
On what?                        

564
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,500
          On what you just said.

565
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,100
I feel like a failure--         

566
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,300
a failure as a mother,          
ergo as a woman and a person.   

567
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Do you make a drink             
for failures here at Cheers?    

568
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,500
    Uh, hold on a sec-- Phil,   
          what are you drinking?

569
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,500
          A Manhattan.          

570
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,500
                      Manhattan.

571
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,100
                    You know,   

572
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
          sweetheart,           
    I'd bet my bottom dollar    

573
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,500
 that you're a pretty good mom. 

574
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,900
Yes, well, considering          
that endorsement comes          

575
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
from a perennial Peter Pan      

576
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
with no sense                   
of maturity                     

577
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,300
or obligation, you'll excuse me 
 if I don't leap over the bar,  

578
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,000
embrace you,                    
and say, "Really, Sam?          

579
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
     You think so?"             

580
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,200
              Well, glad I could
            be there for you.   

581
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,100
I'm sorry.                      

582
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,800
    Perhaps I'm just bitter     

583
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,900
 because Frasier is succeeding  
  with our son where I failed.  

584
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,400
He is indeed                    
a better influence              

585
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,900
      on my precious baby.      

586
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,400
Hey, guess what, everybody?     

587
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,400
Little Frederick                
beat Cliff at darts.            

588
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,800
         Frasier!               

589
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,700
             Uh-oh.             
What are you doing here?        

590
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,600
  I didn't give my son to you   
      so you could run off      

591
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,300
and spend the day               
in a bawdy house.               

592
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
            Yes, well, my, my   
        little chopped salad,   

593
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,700
    I mean, we just got here,   
          what, ten minutes ago.

594
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,200
You're lying.                   

595
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,700
                  Well, yes, I'm
            lying, but, uh...   

596
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,600
      I-I thought that Frederick
            might enjoy himself.

Enjoy himself                   
in a bar?

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,900
