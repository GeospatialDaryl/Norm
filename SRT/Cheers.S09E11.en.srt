00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
            Oh, no!             

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,600
You got some car trouble?       

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,800
                    Oh, yeah.   

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
        Every time it gets cold,
         my stupid battery dies.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Gotta get a new one?            

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,400
                 Ugh! No, that's
                      all right.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,100
                    I got one   
                     right here.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,300
                        (grunts)

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,700
                     Here. Norm,
                 close the hood.

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,800
Start walking                   
real fast.                      

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
      (theme song begins)       

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,900
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,100
 Takes everything you've got  

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,800
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,300
 Sure would help a lot         

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,200
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,700
   Sometimes you want to go    

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,200
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,100
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,400
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,900
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,200
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,400
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,700
   People are all the same     

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,300
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,300
Hey, guys, how do I look?       

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,700
                        NORM:   
                            Ooh!
                            Hey!

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,500
                Major spiffy!   

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,200
    Oh, that's right! Today's   
          the big day, isn't it?

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,800
    Yup. Kelly's coming back    
          from France.          

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
Ah! She's hopping the pond, eh? 

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,900
        The what?               

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
The pond. It's a reference      
        to the Atlantic.        

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Uh, the Atlantic is an ocean,   
          not a pond, Dr. Crane.

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
    How many of those           
         have you had?          

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,500
    Apparently, not enough.     

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
                    Boy, I am   
                 really nervous.

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,900
It seems like                   
Kelly's been gone a year.       

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
  How long has she been gone?   

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,000
            A year.             

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,700
              Can I put some ice

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,600
            in that drink for   
                 you, Dr. Crane?

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Hey, guys!                      

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
I just put a down payment       
on immortality!                 

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,200
              Oh, yeah? What are
              you talking about?

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
             I'm s... I'm sorry.

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,200
            It just slipped out.

51
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,500
The miracle of cryogenics.      

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,300
         Oh, that thing         
     where they freeze you?     

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Yeah. Go ahead,                 
take a look.                    

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,600
You know, when my number        
is up, uh, I'll be frozen       

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,400
and preserved                   
in a subzero container          

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,100
moments after a doctor          
declares me legally brain dead. 

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Boy, that's a tough call.       

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,600
  You know, in this brochure,   

59
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,100
      the containers look       
         kind of small.         

60
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,600
They don't freeze               
your entire body.               

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,900
No, just the brain pan.         

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,900
     They cut off your head     
         and freeze it?         

63
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Uh-huh.                         
What do they do with the rest   
    of your body, throw it away?

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,500
Well, it's a start.             

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
                        NORM:   
                      Cliff, uh,

66
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
                this corporation
            wouldn't be owned   

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
                by a dog food   
              company, would it?

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,200
                            SAM:
                I want to get   
              this straight. So,

69
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,200
when it's time for you          
to thaw out, what do they do?   

70
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,900
They, like, uh, put your head   
in a plastic bag                

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,900
and plop you in some            
boiling water for three minutes?

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
                          CARLA:
                          Sammy!

73
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,100
         Sammy, this is science,
            not Lean Cuisine.   

74
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,400
      Hey, Clavin on ice.       

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,300
          That's nice.          

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,100
FRASIER:                        
Now, wait a minute.             

77
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,700
                Why is everybody
            making fun of Cliff?

78
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,600
             Now, I'm not saying
                  that I believe

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
    that Cliff's severed head   
    will be brought back to life

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,300
             in the year 2278 to
            charm and delight   

81
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
                a new generation
                  of Bostonians,

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
                  but who knows?

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300
                 I mean, who can
             predict the future?

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
                          CARLA:
                            Hey,

85
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,900
    look, everybody--           
 it's Clavin's family reunion!  

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
  That's it, I'm out of here.   

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,000
     I'll have <i>real</i> friends     
            in 2278!            

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
                        NORM:   
                    Oh, yeah.   

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,800
You and the other severed heads 
  can go bowling or something.  

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,900
        (laughter)              

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
         Hello, Woody!          

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,800
             Kelly!             

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,200
                Boy, I've missed
                     you, Kelly!

94
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,800
I've missed you,                
too, Woody.                     
                Ah.             

95
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,300
I brought you                   
a present.                      

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,300
It's a real                     
French beret.                   

97
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
      Tada!                    
                        Oh, wow!

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
It was between this one         

99
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
and the one                     
with the arrow through it.      

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,700
                  Oh, well, this
                one's nice, too.

101
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Surprise! I got them both!      

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,000
                Oh!             

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
        This is gonna be fun.   

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,500
                This is gonna be
            just like old times.

105
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,300
I can't wait.                   

106
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,200
So what do you                  
feel like doing?                

107
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,000
         I don't know.          
  What do you feel like doing?  

108
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,800
I don't know.                   
What do you feel like doing?    

109
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,200
        Gosh, this is just      
            like old times.     

110
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,000
Listen, maybe Henri             
will know what to do.           
                        Who?    

111
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,300
Henri, my new best friend       
          from Paris.           

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,900
Woody, this is Henri.           

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
                     Henri, this
                    is Woody.   

114
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,200
    Ah, Woody.                  

115
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Yes, I've heard                 
so much about you. Yeah.        

116
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
Give me 40 bucks,               
please.                         

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have to pay                   
for the cab.                    

118
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,700
Thanks.                         

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
I'll be right back.             

120
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
            Kelly, that guy just
        take me for 40 bucks,   

121
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,600
                  kiss you twice
                      and leave?

122
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,500
Woody, you're so American!      

123
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,200
Henri is my photography teacher.

124
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,700
He's the greatest.              

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,500
He showed me                    
all of Paris,                   

126
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
    taught me all               
  about French food,            

127
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,000
taught me not to be ashamed     
  of my body, and he...         

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
he lectured me                  
in history and art.             

129
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,300
            Wait. Wait. Wait.   

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
        C-Can we go back        
         to that body thing?    

131
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,400
     Henri took some            
  art photographs of me.        

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,800
They were very tasteful.        

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
            Now, hold on.       

134
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,600
You-You guys aren't...          

135
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,300
                     Ugh! No, of
                     course not!

136
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
  He's just here on vacation.   

137
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,100
    Sure, he's always joking    

138
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,500
      about how he's gonna      
    steal me away from you,     

139
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,500
     but he's only kidding.     

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,100
         Are you sure?          

141
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,900
                Henri, you're   
                gonna love this.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
          Woody thinks          
    you really are...           

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,700
         (snickering):          
     ...trying to steal me      
         away from him.         

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh...!                          

145
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,700
(laughs)                        

146
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,700
      Oh, that's so funny.      

147
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,500
I am, you know.                 

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,100
Right out from                  
under your nose.                

149
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
                  (Henri laughs)

150
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,900
        See how he is, Woody?   

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,700
         He really cracks me up.

152
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,900
          (laughing):           
    Yeah, that's a good one.    

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
 Now, I got one for you, Henri. 

154
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Get your hands off              
my girlfriend.                  

155
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,900
                Henri, if you'll
             excuse us a moment.

156
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,400
              Woody, I think you
              were a little rude
              to Henri just now.

157
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,900
Yeah, well, I think             
Henri was a little rude, too.   

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
             He's supposed to be
              rude; he's French.

159
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,600
            I'm, uh, Sam Malone,
                     by the way.

160
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh! I've heard                  
about you in France.            

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,900
                  Oh, yeah.     
            You follow baseball?

162
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,200
No. Stewardesses.               

163
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
                    Oh.         

164
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,800
Uh, when I first came in,       

165
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,200
I was afraid that               
you were Woody, uh, but         

166
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,600
then when I saw the real thing, 
I was most relieved.            

167
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,500
                     Why's that?

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
Heh. No competition.            

169
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
I could steal Kelly             

170
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,900
with both hands                 
tied behind my back.            

171
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,800
    Ooh!                        

172
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,200
                 Listen, Kelly's
             Woody's girlfriend.

173
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,500
         I'm sure you could have
        any woman you wanted.   

174
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,300
I know, but, uh, Kelly          
is so innocent and naive.       

175
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,100
I love to change that.          

176
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
                Boy, I'm kind   
                of torn here.   

177
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,200
              I mean, Woody's my
                closest friend, 

178
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,200
              but that is a real
                solid argument. 

179
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,400
    You know, Woody may surprise
            you there, you know.

180
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
            He's, uh... looks   
                like a pushover,

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,700
                but he's got his
                 way with women.

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
     Oh, no, I've been shot     
    through the head!           

183
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
     I've been shot             
    through the head!           

184
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,900
I'll take my chances.           

185
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,000
(Henri and Kelly laughing)      

186
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,800
Come on, Woody.                 

187
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,400
Woody, how about                
this one?                       

188
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,700
Knock, knock.                   

189
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,100
                    Who's there?

190
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,500
Henri, the guy who's going      
to steal your girlfriend.       

191
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,100
KELLY:                          
Now, Henri,                     

192
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,900
        this is getting         
    a little tiresome.          

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,100
    Oh?                         

194
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,300
          I'm kidding.          

195
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
    It's really cute.           

196
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,900
Oh. Woody, why don't you        
get us some drinks?             

197
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,500
    Three sodas, Sam.           

198
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,800
                You know, Woody,
              I... I'd watch out

199
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,300
                for that guy,   
                  if I were you.

200
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,700
Oh, I know he's annoying, Carla,

201
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,700
but Kelly swears that he's just 
 joking around to get my goat.  

202
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
         I don't think          
he's joking around there, Woody.

203
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
                Yeah, I don't   
            think so, either.   

204
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
              I mean, the French
            aren't exactly known

205
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
                    for their   
                 sense of humor.

206
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,900
    What do you mean?           

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,700
                Well, let me put
                    it this way:

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,200
        Their, uh, comic hero   
                 is Jerry Lewis.

209
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,200
    What's your point?          

210
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
         Yeah.                  
What's your point?              

211
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,900
        Oh, Henri,              
    that's impossible!          

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,300
No one can do that!             

213
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
                  No. It's true.

214
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,800
                  I'll show you.

215
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,200
    What are you guys doing?    

216
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
Henri says he can               
teach me to tie a knot          

217
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,800
in a cherry stem                
with my tongue.                 

218
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
                 Here, uh, we'll
                    demonstrate.

219
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,200
                     I'll be the
                    cherry stem.

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,300
Hold it. Hold it.               

221
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,400
That's it, frogman.             

222
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,900
Get away                        
from my girlfriend!             

223
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
I know what you're thinking.    

224
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
You're thinking you're more     
sophisticated than me,          

225
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,600
and classier than me,           
and smarter than me,            

226
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,400
and that... and that you got    
better hair than mine,          

227
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
and that you're taller          
than me,                        

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,100
and-and you got                 
that strong jaw line.           

229
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,400
What was my point?              

230
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,400
    Oh, yeah--                  
you get out of here             

231
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,400
before I kick your butt         
back to the Eiffel Tower!       

232
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,400
                      Very well.

233
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,600
                 But I do feel I
            should be allowed   

234
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
                to say something
                  in my defense.

235
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
        Go ahead.               

236
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,900
              I'm going to steal
                your girlfriend.

237
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,200
        I can't believe         
  Kelly would be so mad at me   

238
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,900
          just 'cause           
      I stood up to Henri.      

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
                    It's like   
                  she's starting

240
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,100
                     to like him
                 better than me.

241
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,700
             Hey, Sam, you don't
                think that...   

242
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,800
                maybe they've   
                      been to...

243
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,300
To the back of the barn?        

244
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,600
                 I was gonna say
                to bed together.

245
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,100
                What-What is the
            back of the barn?   

246
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,100
            What does that mean?

247
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,800
        That-That's-That's where
            the compost heap is.

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,300
            I can't think of any
            place less romantic.

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
I don't think they've           
slept together yet, Woody,      

250
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
but I-I would be concerned      
about Henri.                    

251
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
I mean, I know                  
guys like this.                 

252
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, I <i>am</i>                    
  a guy like this.              

253
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,900
    Well, what can I do, Sam?   

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,300
Well, how's-how's               
your love life?                 

255
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,700
I mean, the physical part?      

256
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
                Well, I can't   
                speak for Kelly,

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
                 but I'm looking
                  forward to it.

258
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,900
You're-You're telling me        

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,600
that-that you and Kelly         
haven't slept together?         

260
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
    Well, uh, we-we did once,   

261
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
                 when we went to
                 see <i>Old Gringo,</i>

262
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,100
                  but the whole 
                row was snoring.

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, I... You know,            

264
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,900
I think this may be             
your problem here, Wood.        

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
          Well, I always figured

266
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
        we'd wait until after   
                we were married.

267
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,200
            That's-That's the   
                way everybody in
                Hanover does it.

268
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,800
          Except for that couple
             that teaches art at
                the high school.

269
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,400
  I think waiting for marriage  
      is a wonderful idea.      

270
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
                        REBECCA:
                I wish I had.   

271
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,800
     I also wish that I had     
studied harder in college       

272
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,700
         and maybe gone         
    for a different career.     

273
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
    Maybe engineering.          

274
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,300
         And, you know,         
     Boston was a bad move.     

275
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,200
  And then, I mean, of course,  

276
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,700
        you can't choose        
    your own parents.           

277
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,000
      But if I could have,      
    I would have chosen two     

278
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,900
that were more supportive,      
you know, like Brian Keith      

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,300
    and Maureen O'Hara          
      in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>       

280
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
     Woody, is this helping you?

281
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
         Well, even if it isn't,

282
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,200
            just thinking about 
               <i>The Parent Trap</i>  

283
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,900
                for a moment    
             made me feel good. 

284
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,400
    What do you think about     
     premarital sex, Mr. P?     

285
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,900
     Well, Wood, there's an     
  old saying, you know, uh...   

286
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,400
 "Why buy the cow when you can  
    get the milk for free?"     

287
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
        Then of course,         
you, uh, you get married,       

288
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,000
you wake up one day and realize:

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,900
          "Oh, my God.          
      I've married a cow."      

290
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,100
         Thanks, Mr. P.         

291
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,900
                Hey, uh, Sam,   
                what if we do it

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
                  and it becomes
                  like a crutch,

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
        and we rely on it for   
          the rest of our lives?

294
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,100
Well, then you know             
you did it right.               

295
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,500
But you better hurry            

296
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,400
or Henri's gonna                
beat you to it.                 

297
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,200
                  All right.    

298
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,500
            I'm gonna go        
            through with it.    

299
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
      All right!                

300
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,700
WOODY:                          
Yeah, right.                    

301
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,200
    But if it's gonna happen,   

302
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,900
        it's gotta be wonderful.

303
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,400
                Where can we go?

304
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
    We can't go to her place,   
          'cause her Dad's home.

305
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Well, then why don't you        
go to a motel?                  

306
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,100
    This is all second nature   
          to you, isn't it, Sam?

307
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,900
          Look at him.          

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Walking out of here a boy,      

309
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,900
and he's gonna come back...     

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
    a happy boy.                

311
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
                Everyone!       

312
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,100
              This is Dr. Eugene
                Eckworth,       

313
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,500
            a renowned scientist
            and surgeon.        

314
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,600
            A man who not only  
         believes in cryogenics,

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,000
          but has just performed
              the procedure     

316
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
                 you all scorned
                so zestfully.   

317
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,500
    Yes, I'm in the process     
        of transferring         

318
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,700
one of our thermostatic clients 
     to a storage facility.     

319
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,700
 My good friend, Frasier, asked 
me to stop by for a drink.      

320
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,300
 You-You telling me you brought 

321
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
  a severed head into the bar?  

322
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,900
Oh, man, we gotta have a policy 
    against that, don't we?     

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
CLIFF:                          
Hey.                            

324
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't worry, it's,              
uh, it's frozen.                

325
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,700
It's not like it's gonna        
go bad or anything.             

326
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,700
Hey, a game of pool, Gene?      
You can leave the head there.   

327
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Oh, that's just fine.           

328
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Ooh, weird-looking box.         

329
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,400
What's in there?                

330
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,100
            Um, I don't know.   

331
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
             Why don't you look?

332
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
    Okay.                       
    No! No-no, don't do that!   

333
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,100
        There's a frozen severed
             head in that thing.

334
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,700
Oh, give me a break, Sam.       

335
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,700
She's right.                    
There's no head in there.       

336
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,500
Then why doesn't                
somebody open it?               

337
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
 Yeah, you're kind of in charge 

338
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,000
 of all body parts around here, 
        aren't you, Sam?        

339
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,600
              All right, we'll--
                 I'll open it up

340
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
     take a quick look, see that
        there's no head in there

341
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,200
      and then I'll just shut it
            up again, all right?
Okay.                           

342
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,300
            (chuckles):         
                 This...        

343
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
        Well?                   

344
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,100
      I can't see anything      
        in there.               

345
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,300
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:          
Help me.                        

346
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,700
        (all screaming)         

347
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,400
                          CLIFF:
                    Ha! Ha! Hey!

348
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,900
Hey! Well, look who's           
laughing now, huh?              

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
    ELECTRONIC VOICE:           
     Help me... Help me...      

350
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
        (switch clicks)         

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,200
Ha! You guys were running away  
from a tape recorder!           

352
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,500
Cliff, I must admit             
that was funny.                 

353
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,800
             Thanks a lot, Gene.

354
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,400
No problem, Fras.               
             FRASIER (laughing):
                 Take care.     

355
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
    Hey, Doc, that was great.   

356
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,700
        Congratulations.        

357
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,300
We make a good team,            
you and me.                     

358
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,500
Ah, we showed them.             

359
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,200
Hey, how would you like         
to play a trick like that       

360
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,500
on somebody else                
tomorrow, huh?                  

361
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,100
Wouldn't that be great?         

362
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Lot of people I'd like          
to get even with.               

363
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
Guys down at the post office.   

364
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,000
All the people in               
my apartment complex.           

365
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,400
 Ma! Ooh, I'd love to nail her! 

366
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,700
            Help me!            

367
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,900
         Well, here's your room,
            Mr. and Mrs. Malone.

368
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,400
        Well, thank you.        

369
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,700
The wife and I really enjoy     

370
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
getting away from the kids      
for a relaxing evening.         

371
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
By the way, honey, shouldn't    
we call the babysitter          

372
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,700
and tell her there's            
some chicken in the fridge?     

373
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,200
The little woman                
is a great cook.                

374
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,900
Almost makes putting up         

375
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,700
with the mother-in-law          
     worthwhile.                

376
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,400
You two aren't married, are you?

377
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,600
        No.                     

378
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,900
        (flatly):               
  Gee, you really had me going  
    there for a while.          

379
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,500
(door closes)                   

380
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,400
Well, this is it.               

381
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,000
Just you and me alone together. 

382
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,400
So, uh, what should we do first?

383
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
         We could kiss.         

384
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,600
     Yeah, we've done that      
         lots of times.         

385
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,300
             Yeah.              

386
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,300
            Boy, I've never felt
             this self-conscious

387
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,500
              about kissing you.

388
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,300
              My lips feel huge.

389
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, they've always been full. 

390
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,600
                Really?         

391
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
              They feel like two
             big pieces of liver

392
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,600
              slapping together.

393
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,500
      Oh, no, I can hardly talk.

394
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,300
Woody, I think we're both       
a little bit nervous,           

395
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,600
so why don't we                 
lie down and relax.             

396
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,500
    Okay?                       

397
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
                      (sighs)   

398
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,700
      Oh! Hey, this is one      
    of those vibrating beds.    

399
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,800
  I always wanted to try this.  

400
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
         (coin clinks)          

401
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,100
Oh, darn, I dropped the quarter.

402
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,500
    I have another quarter.     

403
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
      No, no, I'll get it.      

404
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,400
    (coin clatters into box)    

405
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
        (electric motor         
      rattles and whirrs)       

406
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
        (loudly):               
    I'll turn it off!           

407
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,100
    Boy, I don't know           
  why people like this thing.   

408
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Let me kiss                     
your head, Woody.               

409
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Does that feel better?          

410
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,700
  Yeah, that feels a lot better.

411
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,100
        (knocking)              

412
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
                  Oh, no.       

413
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,000
            It's the manager.   

414
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,600
                  He figured out
              we're not married.

415
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,200
    But, Woody, you told him    
    we're not married.          

416
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,900
        Then I guess it was easy
      for him to piece together.

417
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
(knocking)                      
             CARLA:             
     Woody, open the door!      

418
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,100
                 Carla, what are
                 you doing here?

419
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Oh, good,                       
you're still dressed.           

420
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,500
Thank God I'm not too late.     

421
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,100
                  I knew I would
             find you guys here.

422
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,400
    I gotta talk to you guys    
        before you make         

423
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
what could be the worst mistake 
         of your lives.         

424
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,500
    What's she talking          
         about, Woody?          

425
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,900
    I'm talking about           
    you two getting together    

426
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
    in this motel room          
for all the wrong reasons.      

427
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
      She's talking about       
 the two of us getting together 

428
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
    in this motel room          
for all the wrong reasons.      

429
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,100
            Kids...             

430
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,000
    ...making love...           

431
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,400
    is a very special thing     
      between two people.       

432
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,500
         You don't want         
    to throw that away          

433
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,900
      just so you can beat      
  some Frenchman to the punch.  

434
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,500
          Believe me.           

435
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,900
      I came to this motel      
    when I was 16 years old.    

436
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,600
    You know what happened?     

437
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
    I got knocked up.           

438
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,800
      And, uh, here I am,       

439
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,500
    eight kids later,           
    trying to talk you kids     

440
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,300
out of making the same mistake. 

441
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Carla's right.                  

442
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,100
When it happens,                
it has to be special.           

443
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,700
 It has to be the most          

444
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,600
meaningful thing                
in the whole world.             

445
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,200
You know, if...                 
if it were up to me,            

446
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,100
I... I think                    
we should wait.                 

447
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
                  You mean until
                  we're married?

448
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,900
No, until I can                 
afford a nice room              
at the Four Seasons,            

449
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,600
 instead of some                
  cheap motel.                  

450
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,800
No offense, Carla.              

451
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I know this place has           
sentimental meaning to you.     

452
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,600
      Let's go.                 

453
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,400
        Boy, I'm glad I could   
                  help you guys.

454
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,300
    Yeah, I don't know          
    how to thank you, Carla.    

455
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,500
              Yeah, that's okay.

456
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,700
        See, I told you         
I could get us a vacancy.       

457
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
    Come on, Frenchie.          

458
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,400
    Here's your big chance.     

459
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,000
Steal me away from Woody.       

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,700
        Hey, Doc.               

461
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
Where is everybody?             

462
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,500
          Have you seen Norm?   

463
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Well, Cliff,                    
Norm was pretty upset           

464
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,000
about our little severed head   
gag this afternoon.             

465
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,300
He's been moping                
in the pool room all day.       

466
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,700
I... I don't know.              

467
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,100
             Really? Gee, uh, it
         was meant to be a joke.

468
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
        Hey, Norm!              

469
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,500
  Come on out here, will you?   

470
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,100
  I didn't mean to scare you.   

471
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,700
No, let me, let me              
go see if he's okay.            

472
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,300
                Oh, my God!     

473
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,700
            Cliffie!            

474
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,700
          (screaming)           

475
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,400
     (screaming continues)      

476
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
        (both guffawing)        

477
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
    Very funny, Fras.           

478
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,800
  Hey, I go where               
  the thrills are.              

479
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:25,417
