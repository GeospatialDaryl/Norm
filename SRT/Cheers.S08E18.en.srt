You got a headache,        
     mr. Clavin?

26
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:40,775
No, no, no, just trying        
 to clear up a little rash      
 on my lower back.

27
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,711
Doc says                    
    it's stress related.

28
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:45,346
You sure he didn't say 
         diaper related?

29
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,449
Cliffie, you're     
            stressing out, huh?

30
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:49,884
What's the deal,   
             buddy?

31
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,737
Uh, it's just job related. 
     You know how it is.

32
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,989
I thought                      
 you just delivered the mail.

33
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,461
Woody, woody, woody,        
    a.K.A. Joe public.

34
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:05,933
You've got no idea          
    what it's like out there    
    in postman's hell.

35
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:11,055
Illegible handwriting,     
     parcels badly taped...

36
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,658
oh, boy, you can't even peek   
 in a window anymore

37
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,160
without people going crazy  
    on ya.

38
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,763
But still,                 
     where would we all be

39
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,116
if--if your mailman        
     just disappeared on you?

40
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,867
Probably                   
     just all fax things,

41
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:25,069
that way everything would      
 get there faster, cheaper,

42
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,422
and a whole lot            
     more efficiently.

43
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:32,127
Ahem, some more water       
    there, woody.

44
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:36,797
Hello, fellow denizens.

45
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:38,916
Hey, fras.     
                 How you doing?

46
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:40,802
Oh, my, lilith,     
            you look beautiful.

47
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,304
Yeah, lilith, you look like    
 a million bucks.

48
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:44,706
Thank you.             
         You didn't let me      
         finish.

49
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,257
You look like          
         a million bucks

50
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,526
just stampeded             
     across your face.

51
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,579
Carla, i hope       
            you don't forget us

52
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,315
when you become        
         president of hallmark.

53
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,518
All right, now everyone,       
 pay attention.

54
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,820
I have a little announcement   
 to make                        
 and i only have a minute.

55
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:01,605
Are you in a hurry? 
         No, i was referring

56
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,726
to your relatively short   
     attention spans.

57
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,847
Lilith has authored 
            a new book.

58
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,382
It hits the stands today.

59
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,101
[All exclaiming]        
         oh, congratulations.

60
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:16,054
You just had a baby,       
     when did you have time     
     to write a book?

61
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,940
Well, actually,                
 i've been hacking away at it   
 for years,

62
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,759
but i was finally able         
 to polish it off

63
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:24,295
during my 15 months            
 of pregnancy.

64
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:27,581
Oh, yeah. It took years 
        of painstaking,         
        high-level research.

65
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,918
It's called            
          <i>good girls, bad boys.</i>

66
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:31,786
Isn't that cute?

67
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,788
That was my editor's idea.

68
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,123
I wanted to call it

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,059
<i>a cross-sectional study</i>       
<i> </i> <i>of control group females</i>

70
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,061
<i>with a tendency</i>               
<i> </i> <i>towards self-destruction</i>

71
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,930
<i>vis-a-vis</i>                     
<i> </i> <i>damaging relationships</i>

72
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,449
<i>with members</i>                  
<i> </i> <i>of the opposite sex.</i>

73
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,836
Oh, brother,               
     not another one of those.

74
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:52,640
Oh, yes, but you see,          
 my particular slant            
 is that many women

75
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,742
are drawn to men               
 who are bad for them,

76
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,444
those who represent danger.

77
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,213
Then once they outgrow         
 that need,

78
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,947
they're free to make           
 the mature choice

79
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:03,018
and live out their lives       
 with upstanding,               
 substantial men.

80
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,220
Not unlike                     
 my frasier-doodle.

81
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,675
So what you're saying  
         is that once guys      
         like sammy

82
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,944
are done sucking the juice 
     out of babes,

83
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,946
they can toss               
    the shriveled husks to guys 
    like frasier.

84
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,567
In a nutshell, yes.

85
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:23,371
But my darling will explain 
    it all in further detail

86
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,640
on live television     
         this very afternoon.

87
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,608
Oh, you're going to be on t.V.

88
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:30,978
Yes, some local                
 women's talk show              
 on channel 13.

89
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:33,214
<i>Teatime with brenda.</i>  
        <i> That airs at 3:30.</i>

90
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:40,137
Cliffie, uh, you watch  
        the afternoon women's   
        talk shows, huh?

91
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,106
Well, i might have caught      
 a glimpse of it

92
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,977
you know, as i was jumping     
 through the channels between   
 combat and playboy channel.

93
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,098
Woody, could i have            
 another glass of water please?

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,784
Of course, i have my doubts

95
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,787
about appearing                
 on a program of such           
 a commercial nature.

96
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,156
Well, no, lilith,          
     this is a highly respected 
     socratic format

97
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,826
for the exchange            
    and dissemination of ideas.

98
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,995
Besides, you know,     
         that lady that dresses 
         the parakeets

99
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,130
is gonna be on.

100
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,082
Well, i'll be watching you, 
    lilith.

101
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,483
You break a leg,   
             all right?

102
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,971
Well, you know, sam,    
        as the guest's husband, 
        i have 2 tickets

103
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,457
to the show. I was hoping      
 maybe you'd come along         
 and help me cheer lilith up.

104
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,010
Oh, i don't think          
     i want to be sitting       
     in that audience.

105
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,146
[Mocking]                  
     what, is your masculinity  
     threatened

106
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,914
by an audience      
            full of women, huh?

107
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,450
No, it's not that--

108
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,352
oh, please. I don't want   
     to be the only boy.

109
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,290
Thanks.

110
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:34,391
Uh, well, if you'll, uh,   
     escort my little starlet   
     out to the car,

111
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,027
i will meet you momentarily.

112
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,795
You know how in--       
        in those shows

113
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:40,031
sometimes have that big        
 opening shot of the audience?

114
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,166
I just want to head    
         to the men's room      
         and check my hair.

115
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,635
Oh, i already checked. 
         It's not in there.

116
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,208
Whoa, cliffie,             
     slow down on those things, 
     buddy.

117
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,776
Are you sure they're safe?

118
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,412
Yeah, of course             
    they're safe. Prescription.

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,997
Yeah, but you...

120
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,250
can't be sure.

121
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,919
You know, i mean it says here  
 may cause dullness             
 of the senses.

122
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,204
We better check                
 his reflexes.

123
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,705
Where's that                   
 ball-peen hammer?

124
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,340
[Norm laughing]

125
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,926
uh, may cause gynocomastia. 
             Mmm?

126
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,429
What the hell's that?  
 I don't know. Let me see it.

127
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,830
Hey, doc.

128
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,883
What's, uh, gynocomastia?

129
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,918
Oh, male breast enlargement.

130
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:28,279
Doc, uh, i've been         
     taking these pills here.

131
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,214
Uh...

132
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,934
oh, well, cliff,        
        you'll be all right.

133
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:35,736

00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,915
Yeah, except for that cut      
 to a commercial right before   
 it started getting good.

275
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:48,686
Right when your wife        
    was about to pant sammy     
    with her teeth.

276
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,523
I just couldn't believe it     
 that group got so excited.     
 It was such idiotic behavior,

277
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,858
and all because            
     of lilith's stupid book.

278
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:57,077
Wait a minute,             
     i thought you liked        
     lilith's book.

279
00:14:57,145 --> 00:15:00,130
Oh, i did until i reread it 
    with a scientific eye

280
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:02,300
and the impartiality    
        of a fellow empiricist,

281
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,968
and i decided it's pure crap.

282
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,172
Where's dr. Sternin-crane now?

283
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,606
Oh, probably at home,

284
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:12,376
working on  <i>pure crap,</i> 
        <i> </i> <i>volume 2.</i>

285
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,745
What are you doing, dr. Crane?

286
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,898
I'm just compiling some notes  
 for a book of my own.

287
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:20,317
Oh, now you're not jealous     
 of lilith here, are you?

288
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,604
[Sniffing]             
         norm, please,          
         give me some credit.

289
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,440
I mean, i've been planning 
     to do this for years.

290
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,542

292
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,700
So what's it about?

293
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,803
Excuse me, re-rebecca,

294
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,772
may i have                 
     your honest opinion        
     about something, you know,

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,809
as a woman who has         
     fatally bad taste in men?

296
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:49,646
Do you think           
         i'm a good boy?

297
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:53,150
Frasier, you have to stop      
 doing this to yourself.

298
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,970
Why do you feel inferior    
    to sam just because         
    you're good?

299
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:00,074
You know, i agree with      
    that talk-show host.

300
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,727
Give me a comfortable pair     
 of old ratty house slippers    
 any day.

301
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,713
So that's how it is?

302
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,649
Now i'm a pair                 
 of ratty old house slippers.

303
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,051
At least this afternoon 
        i was an old shoe.

304
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,455
You could wear me      
         outside, maybe do      
         a little gardening.

305
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,224
Frasier, i did not mean--

306
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,975
do you think           
         i can't be dangerous?

307
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,629
Is that it? Do you all think   
 i'm just an old slipper?

308
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:25,916
Well,              
             am i a good boy?

309
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,984
Would a good boy   
             do this?

310
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:32,989
I am running with scissors.

311
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:41,248
I'm going swimming             
 right after lunch.

312
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:43,950
I'm leaving now.           
     I'm going outside.

313
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:46,653
I'm going to pet       
         strange dogs,

314
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:49,055
no matter               
        where they've been.

315
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,390
Look out, world,

316
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,393
frasier crane's            
     gonna raise some hell.

317
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:59,116
You know, frasier's helped 
     each and every one of us   
     at one point or another.

318
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,267
[Sniffing]

319
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,637
now he's going out  
            to do something     
            he just may regret.

320
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:05,489
I think we should try to do

321
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:08,542
exactly what we always     
     hoped frasier would do     
     in the same situation.

322
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,545
What's that?                
         Mind our own business.

323
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,514
Good call, mr. Peterson.

324
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,368
Uh, hey, there, pet him     
    if you want to, frasier,

325
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:21,472
but you don't know     
         where he's been.

326
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm telling you,               
 it's only 100 times faster.

327
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,111
What are you talking about? 
    It's gotta be 1,000 times   
    faster.

328
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,429
What's this, a discussion      
 on the bullet train?

329
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:33,117
No, no, fax machine 
            versus the mailman.

What are you looking at?

332
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:43,260
What? What are you 
             talking about?

333
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,664
I saw you casting              
 furtive, sidelong glances      
 at my chestal region.

334
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,934
I'll have you know,            
 it's no larger                 
 than it was yesterday.

335
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,935
And i don't want to hear       
 any more about it.

336
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,470
Cliff, please.

337
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:56,240
We'd forgotten             
     all about that             
     stupid side effect stuff.

338
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,941
Oh, clavin,                
     it's jane russell.

339
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,144
She wants to talk shop.

340
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:04,514
Oh, come on, you guys.

341
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:07,618
Why do you have to pick on     
 cliff all the time?

342
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,252
He's a nice man.

343
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,856
And if he's worried    
         about the side effects 
         of some medication,

344
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,492
i think we could--     
         we could be sensitive  
         to his concerns.

345
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,927
It's very nice of you,         
 but you don't have to          
 come to my defense.

346
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,762
No! I want to do this.

347
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,565
Why does cliff always  
         have to be the butt    
         of our stupid jokes?

348
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:25,485
You know, cliff,               
 i went through a very similar  
 situation myself.

349
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,254
Really?                 
                    Yes, i did.

350
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:30,040
I was taking               
     the exact same medication  
     for a skin problem,

351
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,626
and it cleared up  
             beautifully.

352
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,294
Hmm.

353
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,229
I just hope that puts  
         your mind at ease.

354
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:38,766
Well, i-it does that,          
 and i--i thank you.

355
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,635
So, uh, so when did all this   
 happen to you?

356
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,970
It was years ago.

357
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,138
I was just a little boy 
        at that time.

358
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:58,301
Has anyone seen frasier?       
 He canceled                    
 an 8:30 appointment.

359
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,736
Wow, he sees patients  
         at night.

360
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,673
No, we were going to make love 
 to celebrate my new book.

361
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,843
Yeah, as a matter of fact, 
     he was in here             
     a couple hours ago.

362
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,196
He ran out pretty upset, too.

363
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,281
Oh, it's all my fault.

364
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,284
My behavior this afternoon     
 was unspeakable.

365
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,187
I embarrassed myself,       
    and even worse,

366
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,722
i humiliated the man i love

367
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,457
in front of thousands       
    of people.

368
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,793
I will never,                  
 ever forgive myself.

369
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,895
I saw you on t.V. Today.       
 You were terrific.

370
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:27,798
Oh, thank you very much.       
                        Sure.

371
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:31,384
I'm telling you, sam,          
 if anything happens to frasier 
 because of this,

372
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:34,171
i will never,                  
 never forgive myself.

373
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,708
I hope he didn't go do         
 something foolish.

 your office phone?

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,718
I think                        
 she's overreacting.

379
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:51,054
I mean, what kind of trouble   
 could a weenie guy             
 like frasier get into anyway?

                 picked me up.

 against the light and          
 he slipped on an icy patch.

Out on the highway      
        doing 180 miles an hour 
        with bugs on our teeth.

408
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,801
So, where we heading?

409
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,136
Florida.

410
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:32,339
Florida? That's far.

411
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:37,111
Yeah. So what?

412
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:39,029
You love riding the bike,

413
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,597
barreling                      
 down the highway

414
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:43,533
with the winds                 
 screamin' in our ears.

415
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:47,838
Well, got a little confession  
 to make, viper, uh,

416
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:50,607
that wasn't the wind    
        screaming in your ears. 
        T-that was me.

417
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:53,927
I should have guessed that.

418
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:58,832
It was the first time          
 i heard the wind               
 scream the lord's prayer.

419
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,568
You know, besides,          
    i-i've already missed       
    one appointment with lilith

420
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:04,438
to make love,          
         i'll be lucky          
         if i get another one.

421
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,956
(Ellen)                        
 who's lilith?

422
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,274
Uh, my wife.

423
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:10,244
Somebody married you?

424
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,296
Well, not somebody.

425
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,699
A woman whom i respect     
     and love.

426
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,902
A woman with the intelligence  
 to realize that the measure    
 of a man

427
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,171
is--is not how many studs   
    you've got on               
    your leather jacket

428
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,774
or how many women          
     you've been bad to.

429
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,409
Measure of a man is,

430
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:27,977
how much love and comfort      
 you've given.

431
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,047
You're gettin' dull            
 on me, slash.

432
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:33,767
Well, listen, viper,           
 if caring for the one          
 you love,

433
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,070
if caring for your children,

434
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:39,506
if paying attention        
     to your career and home,

435
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:41,274
if these things be dull,

436
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:43,693
then may i be          
         the dullest man        
         who ever lived.

437
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,862
You are, frasier.  
             You are.

438
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,739
Viper, i'm sorry,              
 you're gonna have to go        
 to florida on your own.

439
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,541
So you're just blowing me off?

440
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,943
Well, i'm sorry, viper,

441
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,579
but i'll always remember   
     the good times             
     we had on the bike.

442
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,549
Even after my kidneys  
         fall back into place.

443
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,701
Come, frasier,     
             let's go keep      
             that appointment.

444
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,236
You're rescheduling me?

445
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,037
It must be love.

446
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:18,471
