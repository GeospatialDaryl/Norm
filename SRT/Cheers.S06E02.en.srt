00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,600
      I hate this uniform.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,500
          It is ugly.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,000
     It makes me look like      
        a beached whale.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
    And on top of everything

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,700
I can't find any earrings       
         to go with it.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
              Try some broccoli.

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,100

00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,200
            I mean it, Sam.     
            I really hate it.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,100
I used to like it,

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,700
but now I'm getting             
kind of tired of it.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,000
Feel like I'm wearing           
the same thing every day.

Listen, I'm not a big fan       
of them either

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,700
but let's just                  
give it our best here.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,100
Come on. Come on.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,100
Come on, Sam...                 
                No, no, don't...

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,800
Can't you just talk             
to the Iron Maiden?

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,500
Convince her                    
to get rid of them.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,200

                you reminded me.

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
            Oh, no.

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,700

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,200
                No, no, no...

        and believe me,

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,100
     I would take this job.

Sam, look...

91
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,100
It's a lot of fun.

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
You see, you get                
to sit behind this desk.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,300
You don't have                  
to wear pants.

94

on the audience.

    I do know sports,           
  and I'm articulate at that.

    Hey, you know something?

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,500
      I'm going to do it.

          or anything?

I got to get going,             
meet my lady.

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Excuse me.                      
The alarm just went off.

116
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
I make an ungodly               
amount of money

117
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,300
and I know exactly              
how to use it.

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,900
            You must be a friend
            of Mr. Malone's.

119
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Well, you know                  
what they say,

120
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,600
"The good-looking ones          
travel in pairs."

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,100
And, uh,

122
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,800
     that's certainly true      
         in your case.

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,300
     Do you have the time?

                the exact moment

and may the sports be with you.

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,700
                    You know,

143
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,500
I bet if you held your ear      
        up to his,

144
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
you could hear the ocean.

145
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,100
 I'll have to try it sometime.

146
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,100
                It, uh, may not 
                work for you.

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey, guys,

148
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm off to the station.

149
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,400
     Listen, do me a favor,     
            will ya?

150
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
 Woody, Carla, close up for me.

151
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
          You know...

152
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,900
 Whoa, Sammy, you're forgetting 
        something

153
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,100
    a little important here.

154
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,800
             What?

155
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
    You don't own this joint    
            anymore.

156
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, boy.                        
            And even if you did,

157
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,300
    Field Marshal Howe          
wouldn't give you the night off.

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,400
Yeah, yeah.                     
Silly me.

159
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
        What am I going         
        to do about this, huh?

160
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,200
Sam, may I suggest deception?

161
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,600
            Well...

162
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
            Hold on your horses 
            there, Frasier.

163
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
            As a psychiatrist,

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,900
            isn't it your job   
            to seek and uphold  
            the truth?

165
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh, get real, Cliff.

166
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,100
    You know, you got           
  a good idea there, Frasier.

167
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,100
          Yeah. Lying.

168
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,300
          I do lying.

169
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Woody, come here. Do me a favor.

170
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,200
When Miss Howe comes out        
of the office here,

171
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,200
            go down the hall    
            and call the bar.

172
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
                I'll answer.

173
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,800
                What do I say?

174
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
Nothing.                        
Just stand there                
and hold the phone.

175
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
            Okay, I'll give it  
            a try.

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,900
         Um, Miss Howe,         
 we're running low on napkins.

177
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,900
                So order more.

178
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,700
  I don't know how many more.

179
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
  I don't run the bar anymore.

180
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,600
Thank you.                      
I appreciate this               
very much.

I'll get it.

  my apartment's been robbed?

     I've been cleaned out?

188

          Well, damn.

189
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
     Yeah, I guess I could      
get over there right away

190
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
and maybe expect not            
to be back here

191
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,700
for a few hours, huh?

Well, thank you very much.

the phone, please.

    Oh, no, Miss Howe,          
    I'm really sorry.

I swear I'll never do it again.

              Thank you, Joanne.

    Today on <i>This Old House,</i>

235
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,400
we're going to be grouting      
         counter tile,

236
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800

to stick around for that.

237
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,100
      But first, let's go       
        in the kitchen.

238
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,900
        Don't you guys          
        usually watch sports?

239
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,800
Yeah, well, yeah,               
usually, but, uh,

          <i>commentary.</i>

243
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,800
      You know, the world       
  is full of negative people.

244
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,400
 Okay, so the Sox aren't having 
      such a great season,

245
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,800
  but that's no reason to boo   
 and say bad things about them.

246
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
     You know, I don't know     
    where I heard it,

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,800
but I thought you were supposed 
      to root, root, root

248

    for the home team.

249
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300

    you're in Fenway,

250
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,500
 you can't yell something nice, 
  don't yell anything at all.

251
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
         This has been          
    just one guy's opinion.

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,100

         That was quite         
    a commentary, Sam.

259
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
     Well, I hope I didn't      
    offend anyone, you know?

260
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,000
        I just feel like        
    it had to be said.

261
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,000

    you've done this,           
but I think you might want

265
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,400
    your commentaries           
     to be a little more...

 something to shoot for there.

        ...Not to waste         
    any of the grout.

278
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Remember, it's nine cents       
            a ton...

279
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,100
            This looks really   
            fascinating.

280
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Oh, I'll say.                   
Gee, you should've seen

281
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,500
this guy put the flasher        
on the roof.

282
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
                  I'm so sorry  
                  I missed that.

283
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,800
I was watching Sam do the sports
         on Channel 13.

284
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,900
                Sammy!          
                Our <i>I on Sports!</i>

285
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,300
          ( <i>applause</i> )

286
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,800
        How was I?

287
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,300
            You were great, Sam.

288
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,700
          Hey, I never found the
          scores so fascinating.

289
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,400
            Yeah, it was pure   
            Musburger, Sammy.

290
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,800
            Sammy, it was the

291
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
single greatest exhibition      
        of sportscasting

292
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,500
I've ever seen in my life.

293
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,900
 And I am not just saying that  
 in order to get a free beer.

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
                  If the spirit 
                  does move you,

295
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,600
 Sammy, I take a size 12 sudsy.

296
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,500
     Hey, thank you, guys.

297
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,200
You know, coming from you,      
        it means a lot.

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,900
            So, Carla...        
            how was I really?

299
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,200
It was like watching            
old people eat.

300
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,500
You delivered the sports fine,

301
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
but you got to jazz up          
the commentary.

302
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,900
        Yeah, yeah, boy, they   
        said that same thing

303
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
            down at the station.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,400
    You know, you got           
    to talk about something

305
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,700
         a little more          
      interesting than...

306
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,800
rooting for the home team.

307
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,000
      That's like saying,       
"let's all drive safely."

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,300
     There goes tomorrow's      
          commentary.

309
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,500
You know, I want to do          
so great at this job,

310
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,900
but it's kind of tough,         
you know?

311
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
I got to come up with           
five opinions a week.

312
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Well, they couldn't             
pay me enough.

313
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,100
You know, I'll worry            
about this later.

314
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,400
Right now I got to get          
Rebecca to give me

315
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,200
the rest of my nights off.

316
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,900
    No problem there, Sammy.

317
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,400
         I don't think          
     you work here anymore.

318
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,100
What are you talking about?

319
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
                  Vampira knows.

320
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,500
             She was watching TV
             in her office.

321
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,600
She has a TV in there?

322
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,800
      Yeah, one of those little 
      tiny ones, like her heart.

323
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,900
    Great.

324
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,900
         Uh, Ms. Howe?

325
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,400
I have a confession to make.

326
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,800
You know that story about       
my apartment being robbed?

327
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,300
I made that all up.

328
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,500
                        No!

329
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,600
          Yeah, yeah.

330
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,200
      Actually, I was down      
         at Channel 13

331
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,100
doing the sportscast.

332
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,100
Hope you're not mad.

333
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
                 Well, you used 
                 to be the boss.

334
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
        How did you feel when   
        people lied to you?

335
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,500
Ah, well, I had a rule.

336
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:20,200
When anyone ever lied to me,    
they had to go to bed with me.

337
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,600
    Well, that's one way to make
    sure it won't happen again.

338
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,400
        You know, Mr. Malone,   
        you haven't been

339
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,200
         dealing fairly with me.

340
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
I know, I know.

341
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,900
I'm sorry.

342
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,600
It's just that this...          
this means a lot to me.

343
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,500
          And now I suppose     
          you're going to ask me

344
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
                for the rest    
                of the week off.

345
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Yeah, I know,                   
it's a lot to ask.

346
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,200
                No, it isn't.

347
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,600
                      You're on.

348
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,500
        Oh, great.              
 What, am I fired or something?

349
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,900
                     Not at all.

350
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,800
         Look, I figure one of  
         two things will happen:

351
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
         either you'll do well, 
         they'll offer you a job

352
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,300
                  and I'll never
                  see you again;

353
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,600
             or you'll screw up,

354
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,200
              humiliate yourself
              and come back here

355
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,700
                 a crushed      
                 and broken man.

356
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,200
              Either way, I win.

357
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,800
         Son of a gun,          
    you do have heart.

358
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
        Of course I do.

359
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,800
Tell me though.                 
What'd you think?

360
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,400
How'd I look out there?

361
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
             I've never seen you
             look better.

362
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Really?

363
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,100
            You should always   
            be this size.

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Let me give you                 
some advice here:

365
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,700
never do this to a guy.

366
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,600
     Guys, guys, he's about     
to do the commentary here.

367
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Anybody know what               
the topic's going to be?

368
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
     Well, no, no, he said      
  he was going to crank it up

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,500
    by taking a firm stand.

370
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,100
        Hey, Woody, wasn't he   
        rehearsing with you?

371
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah, but he made me promise    
not to tell you guys.

372
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,700
It's too exciting.

373
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,400
And I don't remember.

374
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
    Tonight I'm going           
      to tackle the issue

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
         that's tearing         
  professional sports apart--

376
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,800
         natural grass          
      or artificial turf?

377
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
      Now this reporter's       
    not afraid to say

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,200
that he's firmly in favor       
    of natural grass.

379
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,800
          It's softer,          
     causes fewer injuries,

380
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,200
and let's face it, folks:       
it looks prettier on TV.

381
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,700
 That's just one guy's opinion.

382
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,000
            Joanne?

383
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,400
  Gee, Sam, I heard somewhere   
that in an indoor stadium

384
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,900
        it's impossible         
      to grow real grass.

385
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
     Well, yes, yes, uh...

386
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,100
      in indoor stadiums,       
you have to use the fake stuff.

387
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,500
And I've heard that some of     
the more recent synthetic blends

388
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,000
actually do help                
reduce injuries.

389
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
              Oh.

390
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,400
Well, I hadn't heard that, Doc.

391
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,200
     That's pretty amazing.

392
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,100
     So what are you saying     
        here, Sam?

393
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,900
 Well, I guess I'm saying that  
 I could go either way on it.

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So you have no opinion on this?

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,100
    No, I have two opinions.

396
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,800
 And that's one guy's opinions.

397
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,800
         SAM ( <i>on TV</i> ):         
     The Graf-Everett final     
    may be a good match-up,

398
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,900
         but if you ask         
    this <i>I on Sports,</i>

399
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
         the fact that          
  Martina Navratilova decided

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,100
     to sit this one out...

401
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Ooh, to say "Martina Navra-     
whoever" without even...

402
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,100
  You know, I got a phone call  
     today from a teenager

403
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,900
 saying I was taking advantage  
of my status as an ex-ballplayer

404
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,600
  and that old squares like me  
 shouldn't be doing the sports.

405
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,200
          Well, Corky,

420
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,400
    Dr. Buzz, there must be     
         some weather.

421
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
                 Ah, poor Sammy.

422
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,600
        Bet you they fired him  
        after that display, huh?

423
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,700
          Yeah, I guess he won't

424
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,000
be showing his face             
around here tonight.

425
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
  Would you come into a place

426
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,100
     where everyone thought     
you were a complete idiot?

427
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,300
          Never mind.

428
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,400
        Well, I suppose he's out
        wandering the streets,

429
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
        rapping incoherently.

430
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Yeah, yeah, but                 
what if he comes in?

431
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,700
What are we going               
to say to him?

432
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,600
             Well, just tell him
             he was brave.

433
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah, like a kamikaze pilot.

434
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,000
      Wow, I always wanted      
      to meet one of those guys.

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,300
                The stories they
                must tell, huh?

436
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
  Well, I guess as per usual,

437
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,000
it's up to me as his best friend
     to tell him the truth.

438
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
              You?

439
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,300
    I'm sure he'll understand   
    if I tell him.

440
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,100
Hey, nobody is tighter          
with Sammy than me.

441
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,100
I'm the one who should          
tell him he stinks.

442
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
So...

443
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,100
        what'd you think        
of my commentary tonight?

444
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,900
 I thought you were wonderful.

445
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,300
  It just felt great up there.

446
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,600
 I tell you, ever since I sold  
 the bar I've been floundering.

447
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,500
     It's like I'm standing     
         in quicksand.

448
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,200
        You know, I've been     
        trying to get my feet

449
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
        planted on the ground

450
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,200
         and all of a sudden,   
         it's all come together.

451
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,100
      It's like everything      
I've ever done in my life

452
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,100
      has been leading up       
        to this moment.

453
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,500
My knowledge of sports, my good 
  looks, my ability to rhyme.

454
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,000
 You know, I tell you, I think  
I found my niche in life.

455
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
They liked you down             
at the station?

456
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,600
Are you kidding, liked me?

457
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,600
Man, they were speechless.

458
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,200
    Oh, hey, yeah, Rebecca.

459
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Listen, uh, did you             
catch my act tonight?

460
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,600
                     Yes, I did.

461
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,800
So what'd you think?

462
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,300
 Now you can be honest with me.

463
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
                Honest?         
Mm-hmm.

464
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,800
                Let's see...

465
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,300
        as news rappers go,     
        I thought you were fine.

466
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,000
    But maybe rapping has just  
    been kind of done to death.

467
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,200
     Oh, no, you think so?

468
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean, I'd hate to think       
I looked stupid out there.

469
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
             No, no, not at all.

470
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
No, no, no,                     
it's just that

471
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,400
                 it's not unique
                 anymore, Sam.

472
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,800
        I mean, uh, you know,

473
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,900
      it'd be one thing if you  
      were the first guy to rap,

474
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,800
         but they're rapping on 
         stations all over town.

475
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,100
            You don't want to be
            the last on a long  
            train of rappers.

476
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,700
             Yeah, Norm is right
             there, Sammy.

477
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,500
I mean, you got to do           
something different.

478
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
Do something revolutionary,

479
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,500
something that no sportscaster  
does anymore.

480
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,000
You know, like, uh...           
read the sports.

481
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
        You know, I have been   
        working on something,

482
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
                but I was afraid
                it was too much.

483
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,700
    But if you guys think       
    that rapping's old hat...

484
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
            you know, I just may
            give it a shot.

485
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,000
 I'm going to work on it right  
now, as a matter of fact.

486
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,400
                Suppose we ought
                to stop him?

487
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,600
     Oh, no, wait a minute.

488
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,500
How do we know it's going       
    to be another bad idea?

489
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,700
 I mean, it couldn't be as bad  
     as tonight, could it?

490
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,900
    ( <i>high-pitched voice</i> ):     
         Hi, everybody.

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
    ( <i>normal voice</i> ):           
        Hi, Little Sam.

492
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,500
 Are you ready for tonight's...

493
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,000
                    Oh, my God.

494
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,900
          LITTLE SAM:           
          I sure am.

495
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,100
      I think the Red Sox       
    are making a big mistake

496
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,200
trading away young players      
          for veterans

497
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,600
     who can only help them     
      for a season or two.

498
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
                Don't you agree,
                Little Sam?

499
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,200
No, I think                     
you're full of hooey.

500
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,700
If I paid five bucks            
to get in the ballpark,

501
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,400
I want to see them win now.

502
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
            What do you know?

503
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,500
             Your head's wooden.

504
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,900
Well, your lips                 
are moving.

505
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,700
If either of them mentions      
      the bar, I'm suing.

506
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
            Stop it.

507
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,100
Well, that's two guys' opinions.

508
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,000
    Joanne?

509
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,700
Oh, boy.

510
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,900
It seemed like such             
a good idea at the time.

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,400
 Boy, I wanted that job so bad. 
I wanted to make it work.

512
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,900
      I guess I just went       
      over the edge, huh?

513
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,700
        Hey, make him talk, Sam.
        Make him say my name.

514
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
      Maybe later, Woody.

515
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,100
My lips are kind of tired       
        right now.

516
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,500
    I know things seem          
a little bleak right now,

517
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,500
        but, um, I think        
  there's two important things

518
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
        to look at here.

519
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,600
                            One:

520
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,100
  at least you took a chance.

521
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,800
                    And two--

522
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
and this is the important one--

523
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,500
     you know when to quit.

524
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,600
    Yeah, boy, that's true.

525
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
You know,

526
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,200
  I came real close to losing   
      my dignity tonight.

527
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,900
  I've been thinking about it,

528
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,500
 you know, I'm going to hang up 
the old Channel 13 blazer.

529
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,000
    You know, if that phone     
    were to ring right now

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,900
    and they were to beg me     
to come back, I wouldn't do it.

531
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,500
          I think it's just time

532
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,100
         that I grew up         
         and accepted what I am:

533
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,200
                    a bartender.

534
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,700
        And a damned good one   
        at that, too.

535
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,300
        ( <i>phone rings</i> )

536
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,200
            Cheers.

537
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,300
    It's the station.

538
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,800
Well, you're kidding me.

539
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,500
The switchboard's               
lighting up?

540
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
Well, look, hey.

541
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,400
Listen, I'm sorry,              
I don't care if they loved me.

542
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,600
I happen to have                
a job already...

543
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,000
and I have friends...

544
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,800
and I have my dignity.

545
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,200
    Yeah.

546
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,100
Well, thanks anyway.

547
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,500
Yeah, bye-bye.

a little nobility left.

550

All right.

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Okay, Sam.

552
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,000
          Oh, I have to cancel  
          that relief bartender.

553
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,000

you ought to, uh...
