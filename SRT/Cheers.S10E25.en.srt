1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,503
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,539
Move it, you deadbeats.
We're closing early.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,674
Woody, our bartender's,
getting married,

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:09,775
and we're all going
in the wedding.

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,377
Go on. Get the hell out of here.

6
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,813
If you're still thirsty,
go on over to Bob's.

7
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,952
Gee, it's nice to see
my cousins again.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,955
You know, sitting here
in my dinner jacket,

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,890
I feel I should be
tossing off

10
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,494
brittle Noel Coward
bon mots.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,664
Do you know any brittle
Noel Coward bon mots?

12
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,333
As a matter
of fact, I do.

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,235
It seems that after being
told that a very boring

14
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,138
acquaintance of his had put
a bullet through his brain,

15
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,876
Coward said, "He must have
been a remarkable shot!"

16
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:47,446
Did he often find humor
in the tragedy of others?

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,648
Well, darling, you're
missing the humor, dear.

18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,817
He got his jollies
from massive head trauma?

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,352
Don't...

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,420
You're missing
the whimsy...

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,021
Oh, for God's sake,
Frasier!

22
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,390
Can you imagine the state
of mind that would drive a man

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,992
to do something like that?

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,394
Can you picture the despair
he must have felt

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,498
facing a future in which
any hope or joy seemed
utterly impossible?

26
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,401
I think I can
picture that, dear.

27
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,939

43
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,548
Well, uh, you know, Carla,
recent surveys show

44
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,217
there are a lot of wasteful
duplication in wedding gifts.

45
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,519
Yeah.

46
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,887
Everybody gets like,
you know...

47
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,956
four toasters
and four-dozen fondue forks.

48
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,892
They always wind up sitting
in a closet somewhere.

49
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,061
Yeah, so, uh, we went
for the, uh, practical.
Yep.

50
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,098
Ta-dah!

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,766
Hey, wait a minute.

52
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,269
Is that a new
garbage can?

53
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,237
Um... yeah.

54
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,874
Like hell it is.

55
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,277
You just took that
out of your kitchen
and brought it here!

56
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,678
Hey, this is a seasoned
receptacle, okay?

57
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,146
Oh, God!

58
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,415
They got some fetish to look
at a brand-new garbage can,

59
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,017
they can come over
to my kitchen.

60
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,455
Darling, what's taking
you so long,

61
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,123
just to write
a simple card?

62
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,292
We're the most articulate
couple Woody and Kelly know.

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,693
I'd like to leave them
with some words

64
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,029
they can reread and cherish
20 years from now.

65
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,232
Yeah, if they're
still married then.

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,634
Forgive me if I seem
unduly cynical, but...

67
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,837
geez, I've treated
so many emotionally

68
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,638
scarred husbands
and wives,

69
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,040
it's hard for me
to get sentimental

70
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,975
over a simple
greeting card.

71
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,243
What'd you write?

72
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,879
"May you never forget the way
your hearts leapt up

73
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,815
when first you gazed
into each other's eyes."

74
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,685
(crying):
Oh, God Lilith!
I still remember!

75
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,691
Whoa, guys, this is going to be
some kind of wedding reception.

76
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,627
I tell you, it was pretty nice
of Mr. Gaines to buy

77
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,762
all his liquor from us.

78
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,929
I think I'm going to throw in

79
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,998
that special case of wine
I got in here.

80
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,800
Sam, you might as well
leave on your apron.

81
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,068
You're going down to the cellar.

82
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,037
Oh, yeah, you're right.

83
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,072
(humming)

84
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,877
It's all cobwebby down there.

85
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,248
It's a perfectly
sensible precaution.

86
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,417
After all, it's not as though
he slept in a shower cap.

87
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,351
No.

88
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,920
Oh, well,
so what if he did?

89
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,157
I mean, uh,

90
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,959
like any guy might.

91
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,462
You know, to keep the spiders
off his head.

92
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,034
Do you realize, when I publish
my book on borderline psychosis,

93
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,338
every penny I ever spent
in this bar will be deductible?

94
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,374
I just hope
it's a short wedding.

95
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,209
I can't wait to get
to that cake.

96
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,777
I'm starving.

97
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,379
So I gather
the preparations
for this event

98
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,580
have been
somewhat lavish.

99
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,215
"Somewhat"?!

100
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,651
We are talking about
the wedding of the year!

101
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,152
Look at this guest list--

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,822
tycoons, philanthropists,
European royalty.

103
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,658
The kind of wonderful crowd
that I could be mingling with

104
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,893
right now if Robin and I
had stayed together...

105
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,762
which, of course,
we didn't.

106
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,964
He went his way
and I went mine

107
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,166
and the dream ended
and... that was that.

108
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,801
And now I've got
to go over there

109
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,070
and schlep booze
so those rich pigs

110
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,906
can pour it down
their ugly throats!

111
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,010
Life sucks.

112
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,812
Okay to call on you
for a wedding toast?

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,019
Hey, here's the blushing
bridegroom now.

114
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,086
Hi.

115
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,454
How're you doing, Woody?

116
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,757
Fine. Fine.

117
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,492
What're you smiling about there?

118
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,227
Am I smiling, Sam?

119
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,362
Okay, I'll stop.

120
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,802
You're acting all weird.
What's going on?

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,570
Am I acting weird, Sam?

122
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,839
Okay, I'll stop.

123
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,074
Yeah, you're spacing out.

124
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,776
You've got that
goofy look on your face

125
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,511
and that look
in your eyes

126
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,845
that I always
get right after...

127
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,082
Aw, don't tell me.

128
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,052
You and Kelly couldn't wait till
your wedding night, could you?

129
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,553
Oh...

130
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,793
It gives me a whole new
prospective, Sam.

131
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,327
You know, suddenly I
understand all those jokes

132
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,562
you guys have
been telling me.

133
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,831
And by the way,
ha-ha, Mr. Peterson.

134
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,135
And ha-ha-ha, Mr. Clavin.

135
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,472
And ho-ho-ho, shame
on you, Dr. Crane.

136
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,244
Tell me, Woody, why, after
three years of chastity

137
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,513
and just hours
before the wedding?

138
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,882
Well, Kelly was modeling
her trousseau.

139
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,419
And she just looked so good,
and we couldn't help ourselves.

140
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,321
And we figured
it's okay as long

141
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,523
as we're getting married
today, you know.

142
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,225
You still respect me,
right, Sam?

143
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,594
Aw, come on, you'd still
respect me, wouldn't you?

144
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,563
Let's not open up
that can of worms.

145
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,867
Ah, Woody,
I understand
completely.

146
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,870
You know, forbidden fruit
is often the sweetest.

147
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,106
Many men look back
on premarital sex

148
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,041
as the last real
thrill they had

149
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,810
before the cold, dead
hand of matrimony

150
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,881
turned what was once exciting
into predictable routine...

151
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,016
(rhythmic clinking)

152
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,986
According to this
idiotic book I read.

153
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,824
I just worry about
Kelly's father.

154
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,192
He's pretty traditional
about those things.

155
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,228
I wouldn't want
him finding out.

156
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,229
Hi, lover.

157
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,034
Gee, I don't know
what would tip him off.

158
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,703
Shouldn't you be home
getting dressed?

159
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,204
Uh-huh,
but I missed you.

160
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,041
Oh, I missed you, too.

161
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,043
You know, no matter
how often I see it,

162
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,879
the sight of young lovers
never fails to make me sick.

163
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,316
Kelly.
Kelly...

164
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,152
Kelly!
(clears throat)

165
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,387
Look, uh, I gotta
ask you something.

166
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,357
I'm making you guys
an astrological marriage chart

167
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,591
for a wedding present.

168
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,927
And I gotta get
some information.

169
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,963
Oh, gee, I...
I don't know my sign,

170
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,067
but I know I'm not a Virgo.

171
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,503
CARLA:
I know your date of birth

172
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,072
and where you were born,

173
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,175
but what I gotta
know is what time
you were born exactly.

174
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,410
It was 8:00
in the morning.
Okay.

175
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,547
I weighed seven pounds,
three ounces.

176
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,148
I had very fine hair

177
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,185
and a tiny little birthmark
on my shoulder.

178
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,320
Daddy said it was the sweetest
thing you've ever seen.

179
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,055
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,591
KELLY:
Can you believe that sweet,

181
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,226
innocent baby girl grew up

182
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,628
and got it on with
the Woodman this morning?

183
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:29,942
8:00 a.m. Got it. Okay.

184
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,310
Kelly, who's performing
the ceremony?

185
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,212
Don't you have an uncle
who's a minister?

186
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,180
Yes, Uncle Roger.

187
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,615
But it didn't seem
right to ask him.

188
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,550
He's going through
a terrible divorce right now.

189
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,119
Apparently, he got
tired of coming home

190
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,055
and finding his wife
in bed with Hives.

191
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,124
Well, it's pretty
insensitive of him.

192
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,992
Hives is their butler.

193
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,993
Oh.

194
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,698
CARLA:
Oh, oh...

195
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,300
Oh, bad news, guys.

196
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,669
The wedding's off.

197
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,437
What are you talking
about, Carla?

198
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,773
Well, according
to my chart,

199
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,342
this is the worst possible day
for you guys to get married.

200
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,144
If you do, the wedding
will be a disaster.

201
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,813
CLIFF:
Oh, for crying
out loud, Carla!

202
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,182
You ought to know by now,
horoscopes are for suckers.

203
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,818
Oh, they're for
suckers, huh, Clavin?

204
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,254
Sure. I was reading an
article debunking them

205
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,358
<i>in last month's
UFO Spotter's Guide.</i>

206
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,830
You know, kids,
astrology is bad enough,

207
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,498
but she's also a Cassandra
into the bargain,

208
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,167
always prophesying doom.

209
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,169
You know, when Lilith
and I got married,

210
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,606
she predicted that our
marriage would descend into
a life of endless bickering.

211
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,408
That's not exactly what
she said, Frasier.

212
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,743
Yes it is, word for word.

213
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,412
No, you're misremembering,
as usual.

214
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,880
It's my story.

215
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,315
Why can't you keep
your oar out?

216
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,451
Because inaccuracy is a
mark of sloppy thinking.

217
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,152
And what is butting in
a mark of?!

218
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm telling you, Woody,

219
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,192
You've got to call
this thing off.

220
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,294
Just reschedule it for
any other day but this.

221
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,862
Well, that's out
of the question, Carla.

222
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,364
After what happened
this morning,

223
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,133
Kelly and I have to get married,
or she'll be a fallen woman,

224
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,035
and I'll have brought disgrace
on my whole family,

225
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,636
just like
Uncle Orlo.

226
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,305
He got caught checking
into a motel

227
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,208
with a cream separating machine.

228
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,310
It may not seem shocking now,

229
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,680
but in the early '60s, that was
considered pretty weird.

230
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,650
No, got to get married today.

231
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,752
Woody's right.

232
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,186
If we don't get
married today,

233
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,322
we'll never be able
to face each other.

234
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,858
Okay, suit yourselves,

235
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,126
but don't blame me.

236
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,394
Aw, come on,
don't listen to her.

237
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,661
Okay, Kelly, we'd
better get you home

238
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,063
so you can get into
that wedding dress.

239
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,731
Now come on you two,

240
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,566
cut it out. Come on.

241
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,101
Otherwise, you're going
to be getting married

242
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,370
in nothing but high heels
and a wedding veil.

243
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,872
How would that look, huh?

244
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,206
Trust me, Sam.

245
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,908
(laughing)

246
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,013
Oh, that's great.

247
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,848
Okay, Rebecca, you ready to go?

248
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,684
Uh, no, no, no. I want
a picture of everybody first

249
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,719
with us all dressed up.
Come on.

250
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,688
Everybody get over
here on the steps.

251
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,589
You know, it's amazing
how different we all look

252
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,691
when we're dressed up...

253
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,760
sort of sophisticated
and debonair.

254
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,597
CLIFF:
Hey, for crying out loud, Norm!
You stepped on my shoe!

255
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,599
Do you know how long it took me
to get that shine on there?!

256
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,569
NORM:
Oh, did Cliffy get his little
shoesy-woosey messed up?

257
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,538
Hey!
Will you knock it off?

258
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,973
How would you like a smear
on your "triple Es" pal?!

259
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,576
Okay, all right,
I've got it set.

260
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,845
In five seconds
the picture goes off.

261
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,117
(camera shutter clicks)

262
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,288
Darn it, I think
my eyes were closed!

263
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,603
Come on, Carla.

264
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,438
As soon as we're
finished setting up,

265
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,740
we can enjoy
the wedding.

266
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,907
I'm telling you, Rebecca,

267
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,342
nobody's gonna enjoy
this wedding.

268
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,910
The stars don't lie.

269
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,946
The day is gonna be a disaster.

270
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,316
There's gonna be carnage,
bloodshed, destruction.

271
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,285
People will be fighting
each other to get on stretchers

272
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,988
and begging to be put
out of their misery.

273
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,957
Carla, if you feel
that way, why didn't
you just stay home?

274
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,359
What? And spend the night
with my kids?

275
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,229
(dogs barking and growling)

276
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,365
Whew! Boy,
I'll tell you,

277
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,235
those are two of the fiercest
guard dogs I've ever seen.

278
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,971
Mr. Gaines says if you
just call them by name

279
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,340
and speak firmly to them,
they're gentle as lambs.

280
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,641
Well, that's
good to know.

281
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,709
What are their names?

282
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,145
Hitler and Attila.

283
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,348
What do you want me
to do with this wine?

284
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,684
Uh, why don't you just
put it over there
in the wine closet?

285
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,752
All right. Oh, oh, oh.

286
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,754
Wine closet.

287
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,995
These certainly
look delicious.

288
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,897
Uh! Uh!
Ow!

289
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,799
(with French accent):
I have told you again
and again--

290
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,801
don't touch the food!

291
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,869
I am the caterer.
You are just...

292
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,037
bar people.

293
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,306
Why are you being so rude?

294
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,175
You know, we're
caterers, too.

295
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,411
Opening a bag of potato chips
does not make you a caterer.

296
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,113
Huh. That is not a bag.

297
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,414
That is a can.

298
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:06,552
Those are Pringles, Mr.
Big-Time-Know-It-All chef.

299
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,358
Hey, that's the nicest
wine closet I've ever been in.

300
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,927
Well, Robin and I were
gonna have one, too.

301
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,229
It was gonna
have stereo

302
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,598
and hanging plants and

303
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,234
two little chairs
and a little table,

304
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,336
and we would sit
there late at night

305
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,338
with a very special
bottle of wine.

306
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:30,376
The son of a bitch.

307
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,746
You wanted to talk
to me, Mr. Gaines?

308
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,615
Yes, Woody, now that
we're almost family,

309
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,418
Mr. Gaines sounds
pretty cold and formal.

310
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,819
Dad?

311
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,922
But better than that;
have a seat here, Woody.

312
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,858
Now, Woody,
I don't think

313
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,693
I've ever tried
to hide the fact

314
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,161
that I dislike
you intensely.

315
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,699
I appreciate that, sir.

316
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,735
The only reason
I've accepted this union

317
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,605
is that my daughter
loves you so very much.

318
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,241
Oh, I know she's
had other suitors

319
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,509
with better
backgrounds,

320
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,577
but they all had one
thing on their minds.

321
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:06,845
They couldn't keep
their hands off

322
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,547
my little girl, and I hate that.

323
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,115
But you,
on the other hand,

324
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,818
have always seemed to respect
and love my daughter.

325
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,186
But believe me,

326
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,788
if I thought for one moment,

327
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,123
you didn't respect my Kelly,
I'd call off this wedding

328
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,760
and have those dogs
of mine eat you alive.

329
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,429
Do I make myself clear?

330
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,697
Oh, yes, sir.

331
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,900
Now, Woody,
I know this sounds

332
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,803
like a meddlesome father-in-law
giving advice, but it isn't.

333
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,905
It's a threat.

334
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,309
Think he's starting to like me.

335
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,080
Hey, Woods.

336
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,416
Hey, ah, that is
a good shot right there.

337
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,285
Okay, there,
Rebecca!

338
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,553
Say cheese!

339
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,555
Oh!
Oh, man!

340
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,824
Think you got enough wattage
in that thing?

341
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,858
(camera shutter clicking)

342
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,159
Oh...

343
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,095
Hey, you're missing
quite a party out there.

344
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,329
What are you
talking about?

345
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,264
I thought the reception
was after the wedding.

346
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,700
Oh, yeah, but as soon
as he met Woody's relatives,

347
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,435
Mr. Gaines opened the bar
right away.

348
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,740
Yeah, we'd better take some
hors d'oeuvres out there.

349
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,875
I am not going
to tell you again.

350
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,311
Keep your hands
off my savories!

351
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,779
SAM:
Oh, my.

352
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,149
I haven't heard that
since high school.

353
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,351
You-you have a real
attitude problem,

354
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,020
you know that,
you little creep?!

355
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,287
CLIFF:
Hey.

356
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,289
<i>Now you're taking me
back to high school.</i>

357
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,924
Huh.

358
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,459
Yeah.

359
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,261
Teachers, huh?

360
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,664
As long as you two guys
are out here,

361
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,366
why don't you give me a hand?

362
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,701
(clapping)

363
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,036
Hilarious.

364
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,038
Cliff, dry off those glasses,

365
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,973
and Norm,
open up those wine bottles.

366
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,342
Hey, does anybody
have a plunger?

367
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,144
Why? Something happen
to the toilet?

368
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,780
No, my Uncle Elroy
left his leg on the bus,

369
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,782
and he wants to dance.

370
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:57,289
Yeah, well, if I see it,
I'll send it out to him.

371
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,692
Woody!

372
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,026
Woody, for
the last time,

373
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,729
will you call this thing off
before disaster strikes?

374
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,864
Carla, I couldn't
even if I wanted to,

375
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,866
now that Kelly's
in a family way.

376
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,835
Family way?
Just from this morning?

377
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,003
Wouldn't surprise me.

378
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,571
Farm boys know
these things.

379
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,174
She's got that same
glow we used to see

380
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,542
on the brood sow's snout

381
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,811
after we'd fed the hogs
fermented swill.

382
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,045
Yeah?

383
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,513
Pretty soon,
she'll be grunting,

384
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,849
squealing and
cranking out piglets.

385
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:28,220
Never lose those stars
in your eyes, Wood.

386
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,388
Woody.

387
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,723
WOODY:
Oh, Kelly!

388
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,591
You ever look gorgeous!

389
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,293
KELLY:
Shh. Daddy would kill you

390
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,462
if he saw us together
before the wedding.

391
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,497
Oh. Okay, I'll
see you later.

392
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,466
See you later, Woody.

393
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,203
CLIFF:
Oh, boy, huh?

394
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,572
Yeah.
Looking at those two,
it's hard to believe

395
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,440
that one out of every
two-and-two-thirds marriages

396
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,376
in this country
ends in divorce.

397
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,478
Where do they get
those stupid statistics?

398
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,580
What is two thirds
of a marriage?

399
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,750
Plenty, believe me.

400
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,386
Hey, come on,
you guys.

401
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,454
You heard Mr. Gaines.
Woody, if he sees you

402
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,757
and Kelly smooching like that,
he's gonna throw a fit!

403
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,425
MR. GAINES:
Kelly, where are you?

404
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,028
Oh, hey, Carla,
give me a hand here, will you?

405
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,863
I told you
disaster was gonna strike.

406
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,097
Come here, come,
come out here.

407
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,298
(dogs barking and barking)

408
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,600
MR. GAINES:
Kelly,

409
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,768
you're not downstairs, are you?

410
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,636
You have to hide her!

411
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,939
Uh, yeah, Kelly, out through
the, uh, s-swinging doors.

412
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:21,907
No, no, no.
Nobody can see her

413
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,008
until she walks
down the aisle!

414
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,176
How about the oven?

415
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,478
Carla!

416
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,248
How about
the dumbwaiter?

417
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:33,085
My cousin and I used to hide
in there when we were little.

418
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,088
Ooh. Ooh,
it's cozy in here.

419
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,356
Woody...

420
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,924
No, don't even
think about it.

421
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,292
MR. GAINES:
Kelly?

422
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,527
Kelly?
Oh, hi,
Mr. Gaines.

423
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,662
Hi, Woody. I can't
seem to find Kelly.

424
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,908
She didn't go
out there, did she?

425
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,910
I think she's around
here somewhere.

426
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,513
Woody, you haven't
seen Kelly, have you?

427
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,715
Uh, no.
No, sir.

428
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,883
No. Not me.
Not before the wedding.

429
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,885
I wouldn't want
to see Kelly naked.

430
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,990
I mean, uh, married.

431
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,660
I mean, I don't believe in
seeing her naked... marriages,

432
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,062
or being naked
when you see a marriage,

433
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,630
or any of that stuff,

434
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,200
not even with a... veil.

435
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,603
More bourbon, Sam.

436
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,605
Lots more bourbon.
Yes, sir.

437
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,107
The big bottles.

438
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,811
Oh! I couldn't have held on
to that rope much longer.

439
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,014
All right, I don't want
to take any more chances here.

440
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,715
You go up to your room, Kelly.

441
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,550
Now, would you
two stop that!
Now, come on.

442
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,185
Woody, Woody, Woody,
get out there and, uh,

443
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,187
mingle with your,
uh, guests. Come on.

444
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,155
KELLY:
See you later, Woody.

445
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,957
Love you.

446
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:45,891
Love you, too.

447
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,925
Love you more.

448
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:47,860
No, you don't.

449
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,595
Yes, I do, too.
Love you more

450
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,296
than anything in
the whole world.

451
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,199
Wuv you, wuv you...
Yes, I wuv you,
wuv you, too, Woody.

452
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,834
Now, uh, you go out there

453
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,837
and mingle with
your new in-laws, huh?

454
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,207
Are you a history buff, Sam?

455
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,043
Uh, no, sir, I'm not,
actually. Why?

456
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,011
I was thinking
about Mussolini.
Ah.

457
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,248
Oh, I know you hear a lot
of negative things about him...

458
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,550
but any man that had
his own son-in-law shot

459
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,918
couldn't have been all bad.

460
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,122
All right, I think
everything's okay here.

461
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,625
I'll just, uh, make sure
that Woody's behaving himself.

462
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,898
Well, hello there.

463
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,766
Can I, uh, help you?

464
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,702
(with German accent):
I'm Cousin Monika.

465
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,404
Oh. Well, I'm Uncle Sam.

466
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,940
I need a paper towel.

467
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,043
I'm afraid I spilled
a bit of wine, right here.

468
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,278
Oh, really?

469
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,213
Well, it doesn't show.
It does...

470
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,282
if you look closely enough.

471
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,317
Oh, yes, you're right,
by golly.

472
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,587
That's a beauty-- it's too bad
you had to get a stain on it.

473
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,621
Throw that to me.

474
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,723
Thank you very much.

475
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,092
Let me, uh, get this for you.

476
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,462
You're as gallant as
you are attractive.

477
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,297
Well, I try for an even mix.

478
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,733
Are you part of
the groom's family?

479
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,234
Actually, I'm the best man.

480
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>I'd enjoy being
the judge of that.</i>

481
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,508
This is hardly
the time or place.

482
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,776
Of course, under
the gift table

483
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,578
in about half an hour
would be all right.

484
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,481
There you go--
good as new.

485
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,782
Thank you.

486
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,321
Whoa, w-wait a second,
what-what's your rush?

487
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,656
My husband will be
looking for me.

488
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,927
Can you believe that?
She's married!

489
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,965
She didn't seem to be
a fanatic about it.

490
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,734
REBECCA:
Oh, hello, Father.

491
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,169
Can I help you?

492
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,671
I'm Dr. Chatfield.

493
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,172
I'm performing
the ceremony.

494
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,007
(chuckles):
I've been retired
so long,

495
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,209
I've forgotten how tiring
the preliminaries can be.

496
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,146
All that handshaking
and yak, yak, yak.

497
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,614
Is there somewhere
I could just sit

498
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,282
and put my feet up
until it's time?

499
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,717
Well, sure--
how about right over here?

500
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,019
CHEF:
Just keep him out of
my part of the kitchen.

501
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,355
I still have the whole cake
to decorate.

502
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,357
Well, I wish you'd hurry up--
I'm starving to death.

503
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,159
I haven't had
a thing to eat all morning

504
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,360
except one of
those little candies.

505
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,195
What little candy?

506
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,497
Those little candies shaped
like brides and grooms.

507
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:09,101
I made this
for the top of the cake!

508
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:13,138
You bit the head of my groom!

509
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,475
I'm sorry-- I didn't
have any idea that
that was for...

510
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,243
This is the last straw!

511
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,946
You have been an irritation
ever since you walked in.

512
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,416
Now, I want you...
out of here.

513
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,685
No!

514
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,721
I can stay here, too!

515
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,422
I've been working very hard,

516
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,859
and except for eating the groom,
I've done a damn good job.

517
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,430
<i>If you don't like it,
why don't you just leave!</i>

518
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,065
Very well.

519
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,367
We shall.

520
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,168
<i>Allons-y!</i>

521
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:46,171
(muttering in French)

522
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,507
(dogs barking,
growling excitedly)

523
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,210
(door slamming)

524
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,778
NORM:
Probably not the
smartest move

525
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:57,549
for a bunch of guys who have
been handling liver all day.

526
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,619
He left.

527
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,288
(feigns French accent):
Well, you told him to!

528
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,890
<i>Yes! But nobody
ever listens to me.</i>

529
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,925
Why did he have to be
the first one?

530
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,762
Say, is the minister out here?

531
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,929
They need him for a photograph.

532
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,032
Right back here.
All the waiters and the chef,

533
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,233
how are we going
to replace them?

534
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,734
Just relax.
We can handle this ourselves.

535
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,236
Oh, really?
How are we going to do that?

536
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,672
We'll just do whatever those
clowns were supposed to do.

537
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,739
Now, come on, listen to me.

538
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,008
This is Woody's
wedding day.

539
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,176
It's the most important day
in his life.

540
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,210
We're not going to spoil it.

541
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:26,779
Now, we'll just
ice the cake,

542
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,347
and serve the hors d'oeuvres

543
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,381
and don't worry about it.

544
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,817
There's no need to panic.

545
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:34,053
I think somebody better tell
them to wait on that photograph.

546
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,287
Why is that?

547
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,357
Because the minister
is dead.

548
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,739
Dead?

549
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,341
He can't
be dead.

550
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,142
He just sat down there
to take a little nap.

551
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,210
Frasier, are you sure?

552
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,311
I trained as a physician.

553
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,412
Believe me, he's dead.

554
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,047
You don't make
that mistake twice.

555
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,783
Oh, the poor, old thing.

556
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,153
Would you
stop that?!

557
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,690
Aw, no, poor Woody.

558
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,258
There goes the wedding.

559
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:14,526
Yeah, unless one
of you knows

560
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,228
an incredible
ventriloquist.

561
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,831
Well, somebody
better go tell him.

562
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,932
You're right.

563
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,468
Oh, he's just
going to be crushed.

564
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,702
Break it to him gently, Sam.

565
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:27,072
Sam? Why am I the one
who's responsible?

566
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,240
Hey, Woodrow!

567
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,375
How're you doing, man?
Hey!

568
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,576
WOODY:
Hey, Sam.

569
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,211
I just came in to get
my boutonniere.

570
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,713
Oh, he just, uh, came in
to get his boutonniere.

571
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,082
Oh.
Listen, I didn't
get a chance

572
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,220
to thank you guys for making
this such a wonderful day.

573
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,322
Helping me out
with Kelly's dad.

574
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,823
Oh, well,
we'd do anything

575
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,426
we could for you, pal,
anything humanly possible.

576
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,961
I know you would, Sam.

577
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,497
I-I know you all would,
and thank you all.

578
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:55,367
This is just the greatest day
of my whole life.

579
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,869
Aw, well,
that's terrific.

580
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,171
Say, how would you feel
if we had to cancel it?

581
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:01,907
What, are you kidding?

582
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,776
No way. Why would we?

583
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,779
Oh, I don't know, you know,
say the minister was, uh...

584
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,547
Called away.
Called away.

585
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,182
He's retired, Sam.

586
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,484
That's for sure.

587
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,319
His wife died ten years ago.

588
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:15,587
He doesn't have any family.

589
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,256
From what I hear,
he hardly has any life at all.

590
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:18,657
You heard right.

591
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,732
Whereas, I have the greatest
life anyone could ask for

592
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,068
and... you know,

593
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,769
the greatest friends

594
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:35,107
and I-I'm going to marry Kelly
in 30 minutes.

595
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,408
And I just feel like
the luckiest guy

596
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,543
in the whole world.

597
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,677
You sure are, pal.

598
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:39,812
Bye-bye.

599
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,683
Oh, great. What
are we going to do?

600
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,019
Well, I suppose I should
call the police.

601
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,154
Yeah, one of us better
tell Mr. Gaines, too.

602
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,589
Oh, that'd be great.

603
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,225
What are we supposed to do,
throw rice at the hearse?

604
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,095
I'm telling you,
if we tell anybody,

605
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,796
they're just going to cancel
the whole celebration.

606
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:00,399
Rebecca's right.

607
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,835
A dead body at a wedding
is a bad idea.

608
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:06,138
Both times we did that
in my family, we regretted it.

609
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,908
Boy, look at him, Norm.

610
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,177
One minute he's here,

611
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,079
next minute he's gone.

612
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:15,748
Really makes you think,
doesn't it?

613
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,353
Friendship, mortality,
the afterlife...

614
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,188
what's it all about?

615
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,190
That's a nice watch
he's wearing.

616
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,730
No. No, Cliff, no.

617
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,633
I'm just saying, is all.

618
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,402
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

619
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:37,770
Didn't Woody say something like

620
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,405
this old man
didn't have any friends left?

621
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:40,606
Well, what harm
would it be

622
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,408
if we just didn't tell
anybody for a few hours?

623
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,209
What are we going to do
with Father Bye-Bye?

624
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,111
Who's going to perform
the ceremony?

625
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,479
Well, Kelly said something
about having

626
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,714
an uncle who's a minister.

627
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:49,648
Uncle Roger!

628
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,883
Great! Okay.

629
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,217
Cliffie, go find Uncle Roger

630
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,419
and bring him in here.
Roger!

631
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:55,120
That's what
I just said.

632
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,455
Go, go-go-go.

633
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:59,291
Frasier, uh, go stall
while I send out more drinks.

634
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,194
Uh, Norm, Carla, get the body
in the wine cellar there.

635
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:04,730
Uh, Rebecca, ice the cake.

636
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,500
(whining):
Why do I always get
the hard part?!

637
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,903
Just do it,
will you please?

638
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,604
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.

639
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,507
Can you believe
this, Carla?

640
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,943
We're actually putting
a dead body in a wine closet.

641
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,978
Honey, if I had a nickel...

642
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,581
We're lucky.

643
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,717
Maurice already left
the icing here,

644
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,385
so maybe I can do this cake.

645
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:27,653
But what am I going to do

646
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,987
about the little
figure for the top?

647
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,422
Uh, can't you repair it?

648
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,358
Uh, here,
yeah, use this.

649
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,659
Sam, that's pate.

650
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,527
You want me to make the groom's
head out of meat?

651
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,029
Why not?
It's supposed to be Woody.

652
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,201
CLIFF:
Sammy, Sam.

653
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,136
Uh, Uncle Roger.

654
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:46,839
Oh! Hello, Uncle Roger!

655
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,741
Very pleased
to meet you, Sam!

656
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:52,578
I've heard wonderful
things about you.

657
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,346
Who are you again?

658
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,814
Well, I'm the best man, sir.

659
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,883
We were wondering if you
could help us out here

660
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,585
and perform Kelly
and Woody's wedding.

661
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,387
I'd be flattered!

662
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,422
I love weddings.

663
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,559
Yeah, they're such a
marvelous, young couple.

664
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,861
Do I know them?

665
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,233
Uh, quick,
black coffee, Norm.

666
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,734
I love black coffee!

667
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,038
Black coffee is marvelous!

668
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,540
But you know
what's even more marvelous?

669
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:23,208
Oh, yeah.

670
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:24,843
Oh, here we go.

671
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,412
Here we go. There.

672
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,748
Okay, Uncle Roger,
this is Norm.

673
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,517
He's going to help you
prepare your remarks.

674
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:32,685
Pleased to meet you, Norm.

675
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,621
I've heard marvelous
things about you!

676
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:38,590
Uh, Cliffie, uh,
serve some hors d'oeuvres.

677
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,758
Keep people happy,
will you?

678
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,527
Very good.

679
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,028
What's taking so long?

680
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,530
Shouldn't the wedding
have started by now?

681
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:46,699
Uh, well, something
came up, Lilith. I'm afraid

682
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,100
I can't go into it, but, uh,

683
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,902
maybe it'd be a good idea
if you went out there

684
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,337
and, you know,
were to sing and dance

685
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,806
and use some of your natural
talents to entertain people.

686
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,175
Oh, my God,
someone died,
didn't they?

687
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:02,981
You can count on me, Sam.

688
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,050
Good heavens,
death at a wedding.

689
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,019
How appalling.

690
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,458
All right, see? Huh?

691
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,860
No need to panic.
Everything's under control here.

692
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,830
<i>Du dort!</i>

693
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:21,333
<i>Ich glaube Du bist
der nachdem ich suche.</i>

694
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,735
Pardon me?

695
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,803
<i>Ich will nicht, dass Sie
mit meiner Frau flirten!</i>

696
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,871
"Frau, frau," that's German.

697
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:27,072
Anybody speak German?

698
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,607
Just the basics, Sam.

699
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,843
Uh, "Lowenbrau, Michelob,
bratwurst."

700
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:33,445
Ah, good,

701
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:34,880
good, good.
Here we go.
Here we go.

702
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:42,788
(loudly):
I wanted to take German
in high school!

703
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:47,126
<i>It really interested me!</i>

704
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:51,897
But it conflicted
with Driver's Ed!

705
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,201
Anything, huh?

706
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:59,271
<i>Gehe wieder an sie heran
und Du kannst fuer den Tod</i>

707
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,639
<i>eines Hundes beten!</i>

708
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,775
<i>Yeah, well, Ich bin
ein Berliner, pal.</i>

709
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,043
Listen, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

710
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,511
Sam,
What?

711
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,712
I think he's saying
he needs to go to the bathroom.

712
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,480
Oh, I bet you're right.
I'm sorry.

713
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:09,982
Right through the doors
there, Goldfinger.

714
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,117
Dieter!

715
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:15,054
<i>Du bist gewamt worden!</i>

716
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,588
Hey, how you doing, Monika?

717
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:19,525
I'm sorry.
Was my husband being a pest?

718
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,859
Your husband?

719
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,961
Oh, listen, when we met,
I didn't know you were married,

720
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,329
let alone
to the Kaiser there.

721
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:26,031
Oh, pay no mind.

722
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,200
He's hideously jealous

723
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,536
of every man I am
even polite to.

724
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,005
Well, maybe you're
just too darn polite.

725
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,140
The reason I came
looking for you, Sam,

726
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,843
is to give you
a little gift.

727
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,078
Oh, oh, yeah.

728
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,746
Listen, you didn't
have to do that.

729
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,882
Consider it a down payment.

730
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,517
MONIKA:
Now I have a problem.

731
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:48,220
My legs are cold.

732
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,289
How do you think
I can warm them up?

733
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:51,924
Well, if you were
a cricket,

734
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,692
you could always
rub them together.

735
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,860
(Sam and Monika laughing)

736
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,096
Don't tease me, Sam.

737
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,365
I'll be expecting you...

738
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:03,035
unless you need
another incentive.

739
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:05,104
No-no-no-no-no,
no more incentive.
No-no-no.

740
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,006
Thank you very much.

741
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,574
Oh, Lord, what am I gonna do?

742
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,377
Hey, buddy.
How are you doing?

743
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:13,178
Oh, hey, Sam.
I'm missing her.

744
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,014
I want to go up
and say "hi" to her.

745
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:17,683
Ah, no, no. Can't you keep
your hormones in check
just for five minutes?

746
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,284
Look who's talking!

747
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:21,387
Aw, yeah.

748
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,555
You got me there, pal.

749
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,057
You be careful!

750
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,093
(chuckling):
Boy, Sammy, you ought
to see Lilith out there.

751
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,661
She's really working up a sweat,

752
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,730
singing, dancing,
doing impressions!

753
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:34,066
She's doing everything
but playing the spoons!

754
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,334
I'm cooking.

755
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:38,237
Give me an A-flat.

756
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,806
Thank you.

757
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:42,074
(spoons clacking)
♪ When you're smiling ♪

758
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,076
♪ When you're smiling ♪

759
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:46,712
♪ The whole world smiles... ♪

760
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,682
You know, maybe it wouldn't
be so bad to let them see

761
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:51,650
the corpse after all, eh?

762
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:53,352
Oh, Uncle Roger!

763
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,553
You feeling better?

764
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:56,255
Well, well, yes,
I am feeling better.

765
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:57,489
Ah, good.

766
00:30:57,557 --> 00:30:58,757
You feeling up
to performing
a wedding?

767
00:30:58,825 --> 00:30:59,658
Perform a wedding?

768
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:01,093
I'd sooner be dead.

769
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,495
Oh, now, now, don't,
don't you get started on this.

770
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:04,963
I hate weddings.

771
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:08,300
Well, my own marriage
was a, a disaster.

772
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,769
I-I-I... at times
I prayed I would die

773
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:14,006
and go to a better hell
than the one I was living.

774
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:16,075
Oh, my... Just talk to
him, will you, Norm?

775
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:18,077
What am I gonna do,
argue with the man?

776
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:24,616
Marriage ruined my life!
Oh, Norm, Norm,

777
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,185
if you only knew.

778
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,586
Amen, brother, amen.

779
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:29,154
Not now, Cliffie!

780
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:30,189
Uh, do me a favor.

781
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,423
Take Uncle Roger
out there.

782
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:33,592
Find Frasier and
get him some therapy fast.

783
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,527
Sure thing. Okay,
buddy boy, let's go.

784
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:36,528
Are you married?

785
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:37,763
Uh, no, sir, I'm not.

786
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:38,864
Came close once,
but no.

787
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,532
Well, she was a lucky girl.

788
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,368
Why, thank you, sir.

789
00:31:42,435 --> 00:31:45,971
What's the holdup?
Where's Dr. Chatfield?

790
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,143
Uh, Dr. Chatfield,
um, has, uh, challenged

791
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:56,348
the chef and the waiters
to a footrace in the park,

792
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,516
and that's where
they are now, footracing.

793
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,685
Thank you very much.
He was going for it.

794
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,721
Sir, uh, the minister
should be ready

795
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:03,889
in about five minutes.

796
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,591
Well, then I'll just
use this opportunity

797
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,626
to get the champagne
out of the wine closet.

798
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:08,627
Oh, good idea.

799
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:11,030
Uh, everybody loves wine,
Rebecca.

800
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,998
SAM:
No! No!

801
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,100
Please, this is far
too dangerous.

802
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:16,568
Let me go down
there for you.

803
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:18,137
I'm just gonna
select a vintage.

804
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:20,873
Rebecca, can you sew
a button on for me?

805
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,009
Kelly, what are you doing
down here in the kitchen?

806
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:26,245
Now that you're here,
let me get a look at you.

807
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,847
Oh, yes, yes, let's
all look at her.

808
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,350
Kelly, you stand right over
there by the pâté. Oh! Oh!

809
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:35,988
(gasps)
Isn't... she... beautiful?!

810
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,222
SAM:
Yes, yes, yes.

811
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,724
I'm just a bartender,

812
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,859
but even a dumbwaiter like me
can see how beautiful she is.

813
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,594
Oh, look at her, Mr. Gaines.

814
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:45,931
Turn around, Kelly.
Look at that dress!

815
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,667
Look at that hair!

816
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:51,170
Look at that train!

817
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,438
Well,

818
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:53,906
you're just a little
store-bought princess,

819
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,207
aren't you, Kelly?

820
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,111
Oh, Cliffy!
Cliffy!

821
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,913
Ah, you're
just in time.

822
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,514
Yeah, the bride and her father
would like to have a shot

823
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:03,649
before the wedding!

824
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:05,451
Oh, yeah,
sure thing there, Sammy.

825
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:07,419
Okay, now just look at me.

826
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,687
Uh, just look at Cliff.

827
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,856
I already hired
a professional photographer.

828
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:13,425
I know, but spontaneous
is so much more fun. Smile!

829
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,059
(camera shutter clicks)

830
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:14,760
Oh!
Yeah!

831
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,529
SAM:
Oh, oh! Coming
through, sir.

832
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:18,997
Coming through.

833
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,767
Okay. Here we go. Let's
get another one this way.

834
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,269
CLIFF:
Yeah, good idea. We'll, uh,
spin right around here,

835
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,771
Turn around.
and I'll get
a picture

836
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,740
of your baby blues.
Oh! You blinded me

837
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:28,974
with that
damn flashbulb.

838
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,709
Will you be reasonable?!

839
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:33,112
I tell you, I won't
perform another wedding.

840
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,613
(shutter clicking)
What the devil was that?

841
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:36,348
Uh... maybe it
was the radio.

842
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,383
Oh, yeah.

843
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,684
Turn off that damn radio!

844
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:39,818
I've got a
splitting headache.

845
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:41,153
I'm gonna go upstairs
and lie down.

846
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,022
No, sir. You gotta
pick a vintage here

847
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,357
so we can
drink champagne.

848
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:47,026
Do you eat a lot
of sugar, Sam?

849
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:49,561
No, sir, I'm just
a fool for weddings.

850
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:50,596
What are you doing

851
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:51,597
dressed like that? Come on.

852
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:53,232
Mr. Gaines could see
you. Get out there.

853
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,366
(dogs barking)

854
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,803
I still need to have
my button sewed on.

855
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,273
Woody was kidding around,
and he kind of... bit it off.

856
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,075
Where is the
button, Kelly?

857
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,143
Well, Woody has it.

858
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,744
SAM:
I got it. I got it. Woody!

859
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:06,945
(dogs barking and growling)

860
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,348
Oh, my God.

861
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:10,983
Give me the button.
There you go.

862
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,017
(dogs barking)

863
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:14,987
Here, Rebecca.

864
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,121
Sew it on, quick.

865
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:17,322
Sam, I'm icing the cake.

866
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,557
If I weren't icing the cake,

867
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,992
I would sew on
the damned button,

868
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
but I am icing the cake.

869
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,995
You don't know
how to sew, do you?

870
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,464
I don't even know how
to ice the damned cake.

871
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,434
I can sew.

872
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:32,671
Yeah, Ma thought
it was a skill

873
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,806
every young man should learn.

874
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,108
Oh, that was very
sensible of her.

875
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:39,712
Oh, sure, I can also knit,
crochet and do bargello.

876
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:41,180
You ought to see
this petit-point rug

877
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:44,183
I did of John Wayne
ascending into heaven.

878
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,352
(dogs barking)

879
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,355
(gasping):
Big dogs.

880
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,356
Big, hungry dogs.

881
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,324
Thank God, I'm saved.

882
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:53,292
Sam, here we are.

883
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,827
(dogs barking)

884
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:57,363
Well, that's quite a pair
of dogs you got there, sir.

885
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,031
Thank you. This ought to do it.

886
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,232
Put those on ice for later.

887
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,433
On ice, sir. Yes, sir.

888
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,068
I wonder how Lilith
is doing out there.

889
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,571
LILITH:
And this time,
just the women yodel.

890
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:09,308
(dogs barking and growling)

891
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:12,211
Here you go,
Mr. Best Man.

892
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,645
Thank you very much.

893
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:14,847
My pants are torn.

894
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:15,981
Oh, I'm sorry, Woody.

895
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:17,316
Uh, Kelly's father
was down here.

896
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,385
Listen, why don't you
run up to her room there?

897
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,020
Uh, Cliffie's sewing
on a button for her.

898
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,654
Maybe he can take
care of your pants.

899
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:24,390
You'd think those dogs
would know me by now.

900
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,725
Mr. Gaines is always giving them
one of my shoes to sniff.

901
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,529
Quick, quick, haul him up.

902
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,164
Okay, now,

903
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:34,667
if we can get the body
in the wine cellar, and, uh,

904
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:36,669
and Frasier
to fix Uncle Roger,

905
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:38,203
and Rebecca to fix the cake,

906
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,205
and Lilith
to entertain the guests

907
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:43,075
and Cliffie to fix Woody's
pants and we'll be all set.

908
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,678
Sammy, I hate to be the one
to break this to you,

909
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:46,879
but the, uh, body seems

910
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:49,214
to have fallen off
the dumbwaiter.

911
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:50,416
Aw, gee.

912
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,017
Just when everything
was going so well.

913
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:06,699
The body's gone, Sam.

914
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,334
Well, we're just
gonna have to find it

915
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,501
before somebody else does.

916
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:12,604
"Horoscopes are
for suckers, Carla."

917
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,207
Hey, does anyone know
where this dumbwaiter goes?

918
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,642
The cellar, I think.

919
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,811
Robin and I were
going to have one,

920
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:20,979
right off the kitchen
by the inglenook,

921
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:22,981
those little leaded
glass windows,

922
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:26,652
overlooking the little
herb garden.

923
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,321
I'd love it if he were dead.

924
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,324
Okay, tell you what.

925
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:34,526
Go outside there,
see if you can find

926
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:35,661
the entrance
to the cellar.

927
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:37,196
No problem, Sammy.

928
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,530
(dogs barking)

929
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:39,832
Problem, Sammy.

930
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:41,667
All right, all right, all right.

931
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:43,002
Plan B. Uh...

932
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,770
All right, somebody climb
in the dumbwaiter here

933
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:46,038
and, uh, I'll
lower you down.
Okay.

934
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:48,073
Okey-doke.

935
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:50,009
No, uh...

936
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,011
Just a thought, but maybe
Carla should go, huh?

937
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:54,747
Oh, sure, sure. I'd love
to be lowered down

938
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:55,981
into the cellar on a rope

939
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,850
to look for a dead
body in the dark.

940
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,818
Who believes in horoscopes?

941
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,321
Are you there yet?

942
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,756
Uh, a little more!

943
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,424
Hello, Uncle Sam.

944
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,159
(Carla screams,
heavy thud)

945
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,964
As long as you
have my stockings,

946
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:13,532
I thought you might
need something to...

947
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,967
hold them up.

948
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:18,137
Oh, uh, gee, I-I wish, uh--
not now, not now.

949
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,507
No, look, this is
wrong. Listen.

950
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:22,741
This is my buddy's
wedding today.

951
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:23,742
I can't spoil it.

952
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,511
Besides, I have certain
moral standards

953
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,646
that I just refuse
to compromise.

954
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:28,914
Right after the wedding,

955
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:33,986
my poor husband has
to fly to Dusseldorf.

956
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,521
Okay, but I'm
buying breakfast.

957
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,660
I don't feel good about this.

958
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,529
But I've felt a lot
worse in the past.

959
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,999
Carla, honey, I'm sorry!

960
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,667
That wasn't
funny, Sammy!

961
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:49,868
Have you got the body?

962
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,003
Yes. Now pull us up.

963
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,638
All right. Here we come.

964
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:54,206
Here we go.

965
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,207
I see you.

966
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:56,508
What are you doing, Sam?

967
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:57,576
Ooh!

968
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:58,577
(Carla screams, loud thud)

969
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,580
Nothing. Nothing. Why?

970
00:38:01,648 --> 00:38:03,615
I need a bandage
for Mr. Clavin.

971
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:05,284
He pricked his finger
sewing my button on,

972
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:07,152
and he's being a
real baby about it.

973
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,287
Apparently, his mother

974
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:11,490
used to tell him bedtime
stories about gangrene.

975
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,625
Carla!

976
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:14,593
SAM:
Honey!
No, no, no!

977
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:15,828
I'm not listening.

978
00:38:15,895 --> 00:38:17,329
Roger, please!

979
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:19,431
I'm a psychiatrist.
You're a minister.

980
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,632
We're both professional men.

981
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,968
We're in the business
of helping people.

982
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:24,737
Don't make me hit you!

983
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,939
I am not going
near that wedding.

984
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:28,407
Oh, Sam, I give up.

985
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,675
I've tried every
known therapy.

986
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:31,543
This man is beyond the help
of medical science.

987
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:32,745
I don't
understand this.

988
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:35,881
I mean, he, he was perfectly
happy when he was drunk.

989
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:37,649
Calling Dr. Daniels.

990
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:39,118
Dr. Jack Daniels.

991
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:45,324
Carla?! Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

992
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,792
You are a dead
man, Malone.

993
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,993
I'm sorry, honey.

994
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:49,428
I-I'm gonna pull you
up right now.

995
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,363
Hey, you want to give
me a hand here, Norm?

996
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,931
No, no, no, no.

997
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,199
With the body.

998
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:56,101
I gotta get the minister
into the wine closet.

999
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:57,436
You know, this guy
didn't move around

1000
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:58,771
that much when
he was alive.

1001
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,707
I'm sorry,
sweetheart.

1002
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:03,542
Oh, no, no,
don't apologize, Sam.

1003
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,277
Your dropping me was funny,

1004
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,346
and then the second time
was hysterical.

1005
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,682
Then this third time,
I said to myself...

1006
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:10,416
(yelling)

1007
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:12,017
(screaming)

1008
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,919
<i>(thud)
Sie dort!</i>

1009
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,287
<i>Ich habe Dich gewart.</i>

1010
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,489
<i>Nun wirst Du
dafuer bezahlen!</i>

1011
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:19,224
No, no, no. Frasier,
do you speak German?

1012
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:22,861
<i>Ich werde dich wie ein
gefeseltes Schwein multilieren.</i>

1013
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,697
Well, I picked up a
smattering during med school,

1014
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:25,831
but it's been so long.

1015
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,967
I did recognize the
word "mutilate," though.

1016
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,970
<i>Das ist nicht Alles was
ich abschlagen werde.</i>

1017
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:34,973
He speaks too fast
for me, Sam,

1018
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,842
but I can tell you this--
he's clearly insane.

1019
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,110
Good with a
sword, though.

1020
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,978
Tell him I didn't
touch his wife.

1021
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,180
<i>Bitte.</i>

1022
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:43,182
<i>Es ist ein, er, Fehler.</i>

1023
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,650
<i>Dieser ist der
falsche Mann.</i>

1024
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,552
<i>Der falsche Mann?
Yah.</i>

1025
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,355
Oh, good. Now, please tell him
to put his sword away.

1026
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:50,989
<i>Er ist unschuldig.</i>

1027
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,324
<i>Tut ihm nicht weh.</i>

1028
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:56,195
Oh. Oh. Thank you, Frasier.

1029
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:57,663
Whew! Boy, I tell you,

1030
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,832
I thought I was
a dead man for sure.

1031
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:00,933
<i>Du Schmutiziges Schwin!</i>

1032
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,468
No. No, no, no.

1033
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,336
These are mine.
Yeah, yeah, see I, uh...

1034
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,505
surgical condition--
poor circulation.

1035
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,674
Yeah, oh, oh, that
feels much better.

1036
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,976
You know, actually, uh,
that does feel better.

1037
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,781
(howling laughter)

1038
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:18,117
<i>Er ist bestimmt
der falsche Mann.</i>

1039
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:19,752
<i>Er ist ein "Poofter."</i>

1040
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:21,353
(all laughing)

1041
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,689
Well, I tried to tell you.

1042
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,357
<i>Ein "Poofter."</i>

1043
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,227
<i>Hoert Alle, der beste Mann
ist ein "Poofter..."</i>

1044
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:29,361
(guffawing)

1045
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,563
<i>Ich bein "Poofter."</i>

1046
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:32,965
<i>Ein "Poofter!"</i>

1047
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:34,700
(laughing)

1048
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,468
<i>What's a Poofter
mean, anyway?</i>

1049
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:38,070
Well, it means you'll
never have to worry

1050
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:39,471
about the German draft board.

1051
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,640
Oh, Lord. At the very least,

1052
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,042
I thought I
was gonna get

1053
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,044
the living daylights
kicked out of me.

1054
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,612
The night is young.

1055
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,613
Ooh!

1056
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:49,648
(screams, thud)

1057
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:50,783
Sammy, you're gonna
have to let her

1058
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,850
out of there sooner or later.

1059
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:53,786
Yeah, yeah, later.
Much, much later.

1060
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,390
For crying out loud.
$72 million

1061
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,926
and they can't afford
a bottle of Bactine.

1062
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:02,594
I tell you,

1063
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:03,996
if I lose this finger,

1064
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:06,231
this house and everything in it
is gonna belong to me.

1065
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:07,566
Just remind me

1066
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,635
to call my attorney
after the wedding, all right?

1067
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:12,137
Wedding? I love weddings.

1068
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:13,772
Oh...

1069
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,907
Well, in that case,

1070
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,542
how would you like
to perform the ceremony?

1071
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:18,677
I can do better than that.

1072
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:21,213
I will perform the ceremony!

1073
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,218
So, where's Woody, anyway?

1074
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,553
Oh, he's upstairs
with Kelly. Yeah.

1075
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,621
I-I was beginning to feel
like a third wheel. Yeah.

1076
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:30,456
Do you want to give
me a hand here?

1077
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,693
Why are we the only people
who find that funny?

1078
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:38,964
Well, all right, Roger,
shall we get going there?

1079
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:40,232
Mm.

1080
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,301
Not so fast!

1081
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:45,070
Can't I get a chance
to kiss the bride?

1082
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:46,705
No, no. Not now.

1083
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:49,041
Plenty of time for that
after the wedding.

1084
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:52,344
Yeah. Y-You know, I,
I'm somewhat sloshed.

1085
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:53,812
Yes, well, it'll be
our little secret.

1086
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,147
Yes, you're right.

1087
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,615
ROGER:
Black coffee.

1088
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:59,985
Quick. I need a blindfold
and three sharp cleavers.

1089
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:02,988
Lilith, you don't need that.

1090
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:04,123
The wedding's about to begin.

1091
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,425
Like hell. Not before
my big finish.

1092
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:12,531
Okay. Looks like we're all set.

1093
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,565
Where's Woody, anyway?

1094
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:15,200
Oh, God. He's
upstairs with Kelly

1095
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:16,869
working up another smile.
What?

1096
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:19,471
Finally, we seem to be ready
to start the wedding.

1097
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:20,606
I'll go upstairs and get Kelly.

1098
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:21,807
Oh, no, no,
no. Mr. Gaines.

1099
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,876
Right, Sam, and you
get Woody. Let's do it.

1100
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,210
All right now,
you go upstairs,

1101
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:27,012
Mr. Gaines, to
Kelly's room!!

1102
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,149
Sam, please. You're yelling
loud enough to wake the dead.

1103
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:32,584
Oh, yeah, if only I could.

1104
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:33,786
Do you think
there's any way

1105
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:35,354
for him to get out
of that bedroom?

1106
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:36,355
Yeah, he could
always jump

1107
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,990
out the window and
come to the back door.

1108
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:38,991
(fumbling at door)

1109
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,292
Oh, cool. Maybe this is him.

1110
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:45,030
(dogs whining)

1111
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,034
Whew!

1112
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:51,003
I wonder what put the
fear into those dogs?

1113
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,739
Oh, Mayday...

1114
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:59,111
It's payday!

1115
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,080
No, no, no, honey,
please, sweetheart...

1116
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:03,382
You stand still
and take it like a man.

1117
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,783
No, no, I never
fight with women,

1118
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,984
especially one
who could cream me.

1119
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:07,186
Baby, let's stop it.

1120
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,520
You've just finished
icing the cake.

1121
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:11,023
Someone could get
hurt by accident.

1122
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:12,324
It won't be an accident!

1123
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,360
No. Please. No,
Carla don't. Carla.

1124
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:15,761
Please. I need help.

1125
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,897
Attention everyone.
Here comes the bride.

1126
00:43:18,965 --> 00:43:22,701
Oh! Oh, Mr. Gaines,
you must be so proud.

1127
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:32,077
Woody, that was close.

1128
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:34,346
Boy, now I'm really gonna
have to marry her today.

1129
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,817
Okay, buddy. You ready
to go out there?

1130
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:39,818
I'm ready, Sam.

1131
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:41,020
All right.
Here we go.

1132
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:42,021
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1133
00:43:42,088 --> 00:43:43,255
Wood, before you
go out there...

1134
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:44,556
Listen, there's something

1135
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:45,891
I'd like to give
you that...

1136
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,260
well, I wish that someone had
given to me on my wedding day.

1137
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:49,828
Cliffy, you want
to hold him, please?

1138
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,463
No, no, no. Whoo!

1139
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:53,832
No, it's okay,
Mr. Peterson.

1140
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,967
I really love her.

1141
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:56,235
Okay, Wood, just don't come

1142
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,903
complaining to me
in about ten years.

1143
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,372
<i>Although you will know
where to find me, won't you?</i>

1144
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:02,675
Turn around here.

1145
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:05,344
Oh, man, I'm so
proud of you.

1146
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:07,212
Oh, thanks, Sam.
Thank you very much.

1147
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,981
Come on. Come on.

1148
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,750
You see, Carla?

1149
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,185
You were wrong.

1150
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:15,320
Oh, sure, it could have
turned out to be a disaster,

1151
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:19,191
but we all worked together
and we got everything done.

1152
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:20,993
You know what?

1153
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,662
I think this wedding's
gonna turn out just fine.

1154
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:26,598
Just fine.

1155
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:29,001
