00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,900
        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, Robin, I just get           

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,600
so lonely and confused          
when I'm not with you.          

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,300
          Well, now, I've missed
        you, too, sweetheart.   

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Did you like the little         
surprise I sent?                

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,800
                 Surprise?      
The Polaroids.                  

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,600
    What? I-I don't remember.   

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,900
The pictures of me              
wearing that teddy              

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
you like.                       

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,600
The picture of me <i>holding</i>       

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,000
that teddy you like.            

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,300
      Now, Rebecca, don't tease.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,800
    Not so early in my sentence.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, Robin, you really mean      
you didn't get the pictures?    

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
    I think I would remember.   

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,700
Well, I know I mailed them.     

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I went to pick up               
my final paycheck at Cheers     

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,600
and then I mailed them.         

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,300
Oh,  well, they'll get here.    
                        Yeah.   

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,800
    Okay, for this one          
    without the teddy,          

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,400
    we will start               
    the bidding...              

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,200
start the bidding at ten bucks. 

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,400
     Don't crowd.               

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
      $100.                     

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,400
      (theme song begins)       

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,700
 Takes everything you've got  

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,500
         Takin' a break        
    from all your worries      

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,400
 Sure would help a lot         

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,900
   Sometimes you want to go    

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,200
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,900
          The troubles         
    are all the same           

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,900
  You wanna be where everybody 
    knows your name            

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,500
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
   People are all the same     

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,200
  You wanna go where everybody 
    knows your name.

00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,800
      I guess I don't have      
 to show you where anything is  

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,100
        behind the bar,         
      right, Mr. Peterson.      

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,300
              No, no, no, we got
             the, uh, beer taps,

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,600
                    you got your
                uh, cherries,   

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,800
                 olives, pretzel
                     bag... Hey!

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
             You guys got a cash
             register back here.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
          Oh, my God!           

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,900
  I'm in one of Norm's dreams.  

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,500
No, no, no.                     

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm just doing my hour          
behind the bar to qualify       

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
for the employees'              
basketball game.                

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,600
Although my dreams are          
very similar to this.           

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Except for, uh, in my dreams    

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
the, uh, kegs                   
are a lot taller                

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,900
                      and, uh...

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
well, I can fly.                

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
                        Oh.     

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,100
         I've got a good feeling
                this year, guys.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,500
             I think we're gonna
                 beat those guys

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,200
from Gary's Old Towne Tavern.   

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,600
            Yeah!               
Al right!                       
        Oh, this again.         

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,200
  I mean, every year they beat  
      you, humiliate you,       

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
          outsmart you          
      and take your money.      

64
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
                 I mean, where's
             the virtue in that?

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
                Tradition.      

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,700
     Well, forgive me if I don't
          share your enthusiasm.

67
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,100
          I've just been feeling
          a bit edgy these days.

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,300
          Why's that, Dr. Crane?

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
        Well, Lilith, in her own

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,000
    dear, compulsive, little way

71
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
                made the mistake
                    of asking me

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,500
                    if I thought
                 she looked fat.

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
     And what did you say?      

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,100
                Well, I told her
        she looked just fine.   

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
      Ooh, rookie mistake.      
Yeah.                           

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,100
            So, uh, what kind of
     punishment are you getting?

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
        Oh, I'm not getting any.

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,200
     Oh, you got off easy.      

79
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,800
        No. I'm not getting any.

80
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,500
  No, you're getting off easy.  

81
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Ho, Woody, think fast!          

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,700
            (laughs)            

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,100
    (patrons cheering)          

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,900
        Way to pass her         
        off there, Sam.         

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
         Wait till you guys hear
        what I did this weekend.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
            You know, ever since
              I bought this bar,

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,900
      I've been trying to remind
 people it's still a sports bar,

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,100
    so I've been going around   
         renewing some of my old

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,300
                sports contacts.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,100
And for those of you            
who've never seen Sam           

91
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
renewing his old                
sports contacts,                

92
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,100
it goes something like this.    

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
            "Oh, come on!       

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,700
     "You've got to remember me!

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,900
            You've got to!"     

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,900
This shows what you know.       

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,100
      I happened to spend       
          the weekend           

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,300
    going head-to-head          
    with Kevin McHale.          

99
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,500
Whoo.                           
                  Whoa.         
                            Hey.

100
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,700
                    That's my   
                favorite Celtic.
        Yeah?                   

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,700
You know, uh,                   
basketball was invented         

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
by the ancient Celtics.         

103
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,700
You know, interestingly enough, 
so was the parquet floor.       

104
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,400
             You've been working
            without your hat,   

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,400
             haven't you, Cliff?

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
                    So, Sammy...

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
shot hoops                      
with Kevin McHale, huh?         

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,500
      Actually, no, I, uh,      
    I played golf with him.     

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
    Beat him, too, you know.    

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,300
         Hurt him bad.          
                      All right!

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,900
WOODY:                          
All right!                      
        Yeah, you know,         

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 big a star as he is, you, uh,  
shank a tee shot into his shin, 

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
         and he'll cry          
    just like anybody else.     

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
      Hey, Sammy, I've got      
         a great idea.          
Yeah, what?                     

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,400
 Ask Kevin to play on our team. 
No.                             

116
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,500
Then we'll really cream Gary's. 
                        Yeah!   

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,700
  No, no, that'd be cheating.   

118
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,500
    But that'd be               
    good cheating.              

119
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
         You know, at what point

120
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,500
            does cheating become
                a moral dilemma?

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
        I mean, can the severity

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
            of snitching that   
              last piece of cake

123
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,700
             be compared to, oh,

124
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,400
     cheating on one's wife with
      the beautiful, young woman

125
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,700
            that works in the   
        office next to yours?   

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
          I should footnote this

127
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,700
              by adding that I'm
                not getting any.

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,800
      Hello, sports fans!       

129
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,800
        (patrons booing)        

130
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,600
 What are you doing here, Gary? 

131
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,100
I just came by to introduce you 
  to some of my new employees.  

132
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
      Come on down, boys.       

133
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,600
                        FRAISER:
                 Oh, hey, hey...
CARLA: Oh, hey!                 

134
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,900
                    Come on.    
         Yeah, what...?         

135
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,800
         Those guys are ringers.

136
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,300
                    They're just
                a couple of kids

137
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,700
            working their way   
                through college.

138
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,600
GARY:                           
Oh, by the way,                 

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,500
            I just wanted to let
        you know that we're open

140
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,400
            to any wagers.      

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,900
        Oh, oh, that's right.   

142
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,700
                You guys are too
                 chicken to bet.

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,900
 Hey, we're not chicken to bet. 

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 We bet you stomp all over us.  

145
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,500
    If I were you Sam,          
I'd get a piece of this action. 

146
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,700
      He means do we want to bet
    on ourselves here, Woody.   

147
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,600
(laughs):                       
Are you kidding?                

148
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
With those two skyscrapers?     

149
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,800
Man, I thought                  
I was the bumpkin here.         

150
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
            Have it your way.   

151
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,300
            Oh, oh, Sam, give me
          the ball for a second.

152
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
            Watch this.         

153
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
                  (laughs)      

154
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,000
             See you at the gym.

155
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,400
    Boy, that Gary's a rat.     

156
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, can you                   

157
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,700
         believe that?          
      Bringing in a couple      

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
    of professional ringers     
        like that?              

159
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,100
              No, I meant       
        stealing our ball.      

160
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,400
        Oh, man, that's         
    my favorite ball!           

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
          I hate that!          
    Give me the phone.          

162
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,700
          I'm calling,          
  I'm calling Kevin right now.  

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
All right!                      
                        Yeah!   

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
            He'll be able to get
          that ball back for us.

165
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
             He's way big.      

166
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
             Yeah, all right.   

167
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,000
If he wants to play that way,   

168
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,300
                  I'm just gonna
                get Kevin McHale

169
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,700
                    to come down
            and play with us.   

170
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,100
                There you go!   
          Yeah.                 

171
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,300
    If he doesn't want to do it,
    then I'll get Larry Bird.   

172
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,900
No, no, no, no,                 
not Bird.                       

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,800
      If he's in, I'm out.      

174
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,100
CLIFF:                          
Woody.                          

175
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Woody, Woody, you telling me    
you know Larry Bird?            

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,300
I don't have to know him.       
He's from French Lick, Indiana. 

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,300
He's a doofus.                  

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
            So what?            

179
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
      You're from Indiana       
      and you're a doofus.      

180
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,500
    Yeah, but I would rather    
    be a doofus from Hanover    

181
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,700
than a doofus from French Lick, 
  'cause everyone from Hanover  

182
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,000
knows that French Lick is       
 the doofus capitol of Indiana. 

183
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,700
    Of course everyone from     
French Lick thinks it's Hanover.

184
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,400
          It's a fuel           
    of a raging controversy.    

185
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,400
                  Yo, Kevin.    

186
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,600
            Hi. Sam Malone here.

187
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,900
Hey, listen, you remember how   
      I told you about that game

188
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,500
      my bar is playing against,
    uh, Gary's Old Towne Tavern?

189
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,300
            Yeah, how'd you like
              to get in on that?

190
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,200
         No, I... I know, I know
      you've got a busy schedule

191
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,200
                      and all...
Sammy...                        

192
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,800
tell him it's for charity.      

193
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
                  No, no listen,
     I understand, I understand.

194
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
              I'm not gonna bust
                your chops here.

195
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,500
                     You know...
             these needy orphans

196
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,100
    have been through it all.   

197
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,500
          They're used to people
              letting them down.

198
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
    Oh, I'm sorry, didn't I tell
         you it was for charity?

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
              Oh, I'm sorry man.
                  Yeah, charity.

200
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,100
Well, no, don't worry about it. 

201
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
         I can get one          
    of the Lakers to do it.     

202
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,100
I mean, they're good guys.      

203
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
    I mean, they'll give up     
     an hour of their time      

204
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
to change some poor kids' lives.

205
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,900
Sam, leave the man alone.       

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,800
 You know, if somebody doesn't  
     want to do something,      

207
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,600
no amount of manipulation,      
    cajoling, pleading          

208
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,700
     or lying can get them      
     to change their mind.      

209
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,700
     That's fantastic, man!     

210
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,100
        All right.              
    I'll see you down here.     

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
                  Could you call
          Lilith for me? I'll...

212
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,800
         Boy, look at the curves
                  on that glass.

213
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,500
                  Oh, feel that.

214
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,000
            Boy, he's really not
             getting any, is he?

215
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,000
     Pathetic.                  

216
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,900
Woody, uh, pour me              
another beer, will you?         

217
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,800
     Put it in one of those     
        girlie glasses.         

218
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
                 Hey, everybody!

219
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
             I want you to meet,
    uh, your bartender, here,   

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,900
            Mr. Kevin McHale!   

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,700
(cheers, whistles and applause) 

222
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,800
Kevin...                        

223
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,300
        watch your head,        
        watch your head.        

224
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,600
    Low bridge.                 
                  Low bridge.   

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Welcome aboard, Kevin.          

226
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,500
I hope your years at Cheers     

227
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
are as happy                    
as mine were.                   

228
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,800
Sam, I'll get my stuff together 
    and get out of your way.    

229
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,900
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
            Come back here, man.
         He's not replacing you.

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
         He just filling in here
              for a little while

232
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,500
    so he can qualify to play   
        the game against Gary's.

233
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,100
              Oh!               

234
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,500
            Oh, in that case,   
                here's an apron.

235
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,100
All right.                      

236
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,800
         Well, so what's it like
        working with <i>Larry Bird?</i>

237
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
Hey, Larry's great.             

238
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,500
Larry's funny as can be.        

239
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
Boy, he's got some              
great jokes.                    

240
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,800
And most of his jokes           
are about these doofuses        

241
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100
from Hanover, Indiana.          

242
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,400
Did you ever hear this one?     

243
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
How many guys from Hanover      

244
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
does it take                    
to change a lightbulb?          

245
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,900
It doesn't even matter          
'cause they gotta drive         

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
all the way over to French Lick 
just to get the lightbulb.      

247
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,600
                      I heard it
             a little different.

248
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
                        NORM:   
                     Hey, Kevin!

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
            Want to slam-dunk me
        a beer over here, buddy?

250
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,100
     Nah, I can't do that.      

251
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
That's against NBA policy.      

252
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,000
     Oh, right, yeah, yeah,     
        they don't, uh,         

253
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
      like their athletes       
  promoting drugs or alcohol,   

254
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,200
    so tonight, uh, Kevin's     
just going to be serving water. 

255
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
                        To whom?

256
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
Do you believe this, huh?       
     I'm about to play ball     

257
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
with Kevin McHale tonight?      

258
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,000
You know, I didn't realize      
we were playing at night.       

259
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,900
    Are you sure the orphans    
     can stay up that late?     

260
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
          The orphans?          
    Yeah, the orphans.          

261
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,100
              The orphans, yeah,
            you know, well...   

262
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh, oh, right, right.           
        See, uh, one of the, uh,

263
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
         one of the great things
     about orphans is, they have

264
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,200
              no parents to tell
         them when to go to bed.

265
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,000
 Listen, Kevin, about the, uh,  

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
            these orphans, uh...

267
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,900
    well, they're not coming.   

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
             Uh, seems there was
            some kind of mix-up.

269
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
              You know, they had
             tickets to the, uh,

270
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,600
             circus or something
                      like that.

271
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,300
         You know these orphans,
they're always getting freebies.

272
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,500
        Oh.                     

273
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
    I don't know, Sam,          
there's no circus in town.      

274
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,500
      Well, uh, may-- oh, right.

275
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
                 It was the, uh,
            monster truck rally.

276
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
                    That was it.

277
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,700
No, no, no-no,                  
not tonight.                    

278
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,400
    All right, guys, where do   
      you think the orphans are?

279
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,900
     Come on, Sam.              

280
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,200
There are no orphans, are there?

281
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
            W.. in the world?   

282
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,600
              God, Kevin, I wish
            that were true, man!

283
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, Sam, this is all a big scam.

284
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,300
There are no orphans.           
I'm out of here.                

285
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
              Aww, Kevin, Kevin,
                  wait a minute.

286
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
              Let me talk to you
              here for a second.

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,300
                    Listen, man,
            wait, wait, wait.   

288
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,500
    We've got a $5,000          
         bet with Gary.         

289
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
                    $5,000, huh?

290
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,300
Yeah. I-I can't afford          
to lose that kind of money.     

291
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,000
                 Well, I do have
                a friend of mine

292
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,400
 who's on the board of directors
at the Sunny Grove Orphanage.   

293
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,600
    I'll bet he knows           
 where the orphans are tonight. 

294
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,500
        Anyway, I-I know that   
    they're desperate for money.

295
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,800
      And let's say the winnings

296
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,300
            for our game were   
            to go to the kids...

297
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh, hell, yes!                  

298
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
We don't mind                   
if those tykes get their cut.   

299
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
                    No, no, Sam,
                  not their cut.

300
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
        They get every penny.   

301
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,700
Every... Uh, guys,              
what do you say here?           

302
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,100
I mean, we're in it             
to beat Gary, right?            

303
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,400
I mean, that's what             
it's all about, isn't it?       

304
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,500
     I want my money back.      

305
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
SAM:                            
Listen, listen.                 

306
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,900
        If Kevin plays,         
then we're definitely gonna win,

307
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,000
so it'll be Gary's $5,000       
  that we give to the orphans.  

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,300
          But if he...          
      if he doesn't play,       

309
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
     then we're definitely      
          gonna lose,           

310
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,400
  and it'll be our five grand   
that we're giving to Gary.      

311
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
All right, I'm behind you.      

312
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,300
                        I agree.

313
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,000
                I want my       
                money back.     

314
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,700
          Okay, then,           
    we're all agreed.           

315
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
                  Here they are,
                 God bless them.

316
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
                      They're at
                  the boat show.

317
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
        MEN (chanting):         
    Gary! Gary! Gary!           
          Gary! Gary!           

318
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,700
    Gary! Gary! Gary!           

319
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait,         
wait, wait, wait.               

320
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,600
Gary's not here.                

321
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,500
                      Find Gary!
                      Find Gary!

322
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,800
                      Find Gary!
Wait, wait, wait,               
wait, man.                      

323
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
We're just early, that's all.   
We'll have to wait.             

324
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,800
                  Wait for Gary!
                  Wait for Gary!

325
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,900
    Wait... What, am I          
    the only one here?          

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,500
            Okay, guys, let's   
                 huddle up here.

327
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,600
All right,                      
all right.                      

328
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,300
          Have a seat.          
     Have a seat, fellows.      

329
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
All right.                      
                    Settle down.
                    Settle down.

330
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,100
            Come on.            
                      Okay, now,

331
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,100
    the way I see it,           
  anyone gets within ten feet   

332
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,900
          of the ball,          
     they pass it to Kevin.     

333
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,100
                        Yeah.   
        Sounds good             
        to me.                  

334
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
What if                         
he's not open?                  
                    (laughs)    

335
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,100
          Yeah, yeah.           
                            MEN:
            Old Towne Tavern!   

336
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,900
            Old Towne Tavern!   
            Old Towne Tavern!   

337
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
     Well, the cheerleaders     
        are here.               

338
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
        Well, Sam,              

339
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,400
              you really want to
                 go through with
                 this formality,

340
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,800
        or you just want to call
            the whole thing off?

341
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,800
Oh, let's go through            
the formalities, Gar.           

342
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,300
    Say, have you met           
    our, uh, new bartender?     

343
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
        Right over here.        

344
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
                     This is our
                    ringer, Gar.

345
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,500
You're getting a little bald    
on top, fellow.                 

346
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
                    Let's go.   

347
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,100
                        (shouts)

348
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
    Wait-wait-wait...           

349
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,400
SAM:                            
All right!                      

350
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,200
     All right, way to go,      
        way to go!              

351
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,400
                          Kevin.
                          Kevin.

352
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,000
SAM:                            
Good stuff, man.                
Good stuff.                     

353
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,500
SAM:                            
Keep going.                     
Get it!                         

354
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
Nice one, Kevin!                

355
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,400
        Go, Kevin.              

356
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
                        NORM:   
                     Yes, Kevin!

357
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,700
                             Go!
                             Go!

358
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,100
                            Yes!

359
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,900
                    Hey, hey!   

360
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,300
Yeah, right, yeah!              

361
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
                      Take that.

362
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
                In your face!   
                In your face!   

363
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,200
Come on, Woody!                 
Come on, Woody!                 

364
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,500
    Come on!                    
                          Woody!

365
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
    Kevin can't do              
    everything here.            

366
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
How's it going?                 

367
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
         Kevin's doing          
        everything here.        

368
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,000
    Yeah?                       

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
                      Well, say,
            what's the score?   

370
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,700
         Uh, 70... two.         

371
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,900
To what?                        

372
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
          We have 70,           
         they have two.         

373
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,800
All right.                      

374
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,600
          Sammy, I need a break.

375
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,900
         I cannot... move.      

376
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
                Oh, yeah,       
                take a break.   

377
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,600
Why don't you get yourself      
            a beer?             

378
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
              Okay, fellows, I'm
        playing for Norm now.   

379
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,000
                             Go!
                          Sammy!

380
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,200
                    Oh, there   
                         you go.

381
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,500
                     Fast break,
                          Kevin.

382
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,800
Whoo!                           

383
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,000
                 Yeah. Don't you
                  love teamwork?

384
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,300
          (laughing):           
        Well, say,              
        don't you think         

385
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
    maybe somebody ought to     
    go in for McHale?           

386
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,900
I mean, he's the only one       
  been playing the whole game.  

387
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,100
                    What, are   
                    you nuts?   

388
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
            What, we're ahead   
            by, what, 70 points?

389
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,500
                 I don't want to
             just beat this guy.

390
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,600
    I want to humiliate him.    

391
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,100
I want to hear that clown, Gary,
    scream for mercy.           

392
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,500
                     (screaming)

393
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
                     That wasn't
                Gary, was it?   

394
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,200
    Sorry, Mr. McHale.          

395
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,500
      You know, sometimes       
 you can just pop these babies  

396
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,700
        right back              
          into place.           

397
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,200
                     (screaming)

398
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
        Maybe not.              

399
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,100
    Gary, it's Carla.           

400
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
 Yeah, the guys just wanted me  
      to give you a call,       

401
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
tell you that you left something
          at the gym.           

402
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,900
Your money!                     
                     Your pride!

403
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Did you lose a blue gym bag?    

404
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,100
         Cheers rules!          

405
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,300
    (cheering and whooping)     

406
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,700
                Oh, man, victory
                    is so sweet.

407
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,100
    This is even better than the
time we didn't lose so badly.   

408
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,200
              You remember that?

409
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah, but the best part         
was Kevin getting up            

410
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,400
and walking off the court,      
knowing his foot was okay.      

411
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,500
        No, no, The best part   
         was Gary's total defeat
                and humiliation.

412
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,700
                         Yeah...
Yeah, that was                  
the best part.                  

413
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,700
Yeah, did you see his face      
        when we told him        

414
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,600
     we were going to give      
     his money to charity?      

415
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah, you know,                 
uh, those moppets               

416
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,900
will be glad                    
to get the money.               

417
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah, a lot they did for it.    
                        Yeah.   

418
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,400
              SAM:              
         Anyway, uh...          

419
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,300
  that orphanage guy is coming  
  over here in a little while   

420
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,100
    to take the money back.     

421
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,900
You know, Sam, I, uh, don't know
    if I've told you,           

422
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,700
     but tragically I lost      

423
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
 both my parents when I was...  

424
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,900
      oh, in my early 30s.      

425
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,200
  I could sure use that money.  

426
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,300
                    Say, Lilith,
                 how about that?

427
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,500
                    Would $5,000
                buy anything?   

428
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
             What?              

429
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
            Nothing, dear.      

430
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm getting nothing here.       

431
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,200
          Mr. Malone?           

432
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,400
Yeah, over here.                

433
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,100
I'm Dr, Walter Froenmeyer       

434
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,600
    with the Celtics'           
         medical staff.         

435
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,900
        Uh, yeah?               
I wanted to get                 
your version                    

436
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
of Mr. McHale's                 
accident last night.            

437
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,200
  Oh, well, uh... no big deal.  

438
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,000
         He fell down,          
      we put him back up.       

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,300
        Nothing serious.        

440
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,600
      Does this look like       
    nothing serious to you?     

441
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,000
                 God! The skin's
                    all gone.   

442
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,100
This hairline fracture          
runs the entire length          

443
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
of the metatarsal,              

444
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,600
which would indicate            
there was some sort             

445
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
of a jarring after              
the initial impact.             

446
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,500
                      It was me!

447
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,800
  I fell on him and then I tried
      to pop it back into place.

448
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,900
                I'm sorry!      

449
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,100
        Woody, Woody...         

450
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,200
  Excuse me just for a second.  

451
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
Woody, Woody, no,               
now come on.                    

452
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't blame yourself.           

453
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,600
You were just at the wrong place
at the wrong time, that's all.  

454
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,000
        If anything led to this,
  it was Sam's pigheaded refusal

455
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,400
              to take McHale out
            of the game earlier.

456
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,500
What are you talking about?     

457
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,200
Woody's the clod                
who broke his foot.             
                        Oh, God!

458
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,500
FROENMEYER:                     
If you'll excuse me,            

459
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
I've got a whole gang           
of reporters back at the Garden 

460
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,300
waiting to find out why         
McHale's out for the season.    

461
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,700
                 Wait a minute--
             out for the season?

462
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,300
              Oh, my God. People
              are gonna hate us.

463
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,000
Hate us? Man they'll kill us    
first, then they'll hate us.    

464
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,300
                            SAM:
              Excuse me, Doctor,

465
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,500
    listen, there's no need     

466
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,500
    for you to mention          
 the bar's name, now, is there? 

467
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,700
        Why shouldn't I?        

468
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,300
         Professional courtesy. 

469
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm a doctor.                   
You're a bartender.             

470
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
    We're both professionals.   

471
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,000
      Sam, wait a minute,       
let me do this. all right?      

472
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,500
  Doc, how much would it take   
  to put a hook in your mouth?  

473
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
        $10,000.                

474
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,900
                    Five.       
        Deal.                   

475
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,700
Now, she's a professional.      

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey, great work there, Carla.   

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
                Right. Dodged   
                    that bullet.

478
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,700
    Way to go, Carla.           

479
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I want my                       
money back.                     

480
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,600
                Oh, for goodness
                 sakes, Frasier,

481
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,100
     we've been intimate several
          times this last month.

482
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
         Look at my day planner.

483
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,100
          We were together every
             night this weekend.

484
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,000
            Oh, good heavens!   
                That wasn't you.

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,700
What do you mean                
it wasn't me?                   

486
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
          I'm kidding.          

487
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,100
  See? Look how tense you are.  
 You wouldn't enjoy it anyway.  

488
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
          Well, fine.           

489
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,500
    I don't want it anyway.     

490
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,600
          You do, too.          

491
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,200
        I do not.               

492
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,900
        You do so.              

493
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,700
        All right, I do.        

494
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,300
Well, you're not getting any.   

495
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,600
    Oh, Frasier, isn't it enough
 that I'm doing it to your mind?

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
          Hey, Sammy.           

497
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,400
              You're walking!   

498
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,600
    Kevin, when did you get     
      out of the hospital?      

499
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
     What are you talking about?

500
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,900
        Talking about your foot.

501
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
         Aw, it's fine.         

502
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
    I iced it down for about    
  a half hour after the game.   

503
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
          Feels great.          

504
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,700
            Whoa, whoa, whoa,   
                  wait a second.

505
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,100
    Who-Whose X-ray is this,    
        then, huh?              

506
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
            Is that not yours?  

507
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,100
I don't know. Let me            
take a look at it.              

508
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,800
 It says "adult male gorilla."  

509
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,700
         That's not me.         
    Could be Laimbeer, huh?     

510
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,100
Oh man, I can't believe this.   

511
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
  Gary sends in a fake doctor   
      to steal our money.       

512
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,900
        Do you believe that?    

513
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,600
              SAM:              
    God! Even when we           
    beat him, he wins.          

514
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,000
Hey, Sam, I'd like you          
to meet Father Conrad here,     

515
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
from the Sunny Grove            
Orphanage.                      

516
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,800
                    Yeah, hi.   
I hope you don't mind           
that we brought                 

517
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600
a photographer along.           
Listen, Sam, why don't you      

518
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,900
  come on around there and get  
  a picture with Father and I   

519
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,300
         and the $5,000         
    you're giving us.           

520
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,500
Come on.                        

521
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
      You want to do this,      
        uh... right now?        

522
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,900
        Yeah. Come on over.     
             Let's go.          

523
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,300
Okay. I'll be right there.      

524
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,600
        What are we gonna do?   

525
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,300
    All right, short people     
        in front.               

526
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
              Look what you did!

527
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,600
        You made me smack you   
        in front of a priest!   

528
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,800
          Boys, boys,           
     we can work this out.      

529
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,300
             Yeah, how? We don't
                 have any money.

530
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,600
No, no, no, but we've got a lot 
of people in here, right?       

531
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,100
      How about we collect      
    as much money as we can,    
                    That's good.

532
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,500
    we give it to him,          

533
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,800
and then we make sure everybody 
knows that Gary's the one       

534
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,800
that stole the 5,000 bucks      
        from those kids.        
NORM:                           
There you go.                   

535
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Uh, give me some money.         
It's for a good cause.          

536
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
                  What cause?   

537
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
'Cause I said.                  

538
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,700
    Hey, Sammy, Father and I    
  were just talking about it.   

539
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,500
Those kids are really going     
to enjoy that money.            

540
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,300
        Gonna get some shoes,   
              some eyeglasses...

541
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,500
    You know, Kevin, we don't   
              quite have $5,000,

542
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
                but we're pretty
              darned close here.

543
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,100
          Sammy, Sammy, where is
             the orphans' money?

544
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,300
                      He has it.

545
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
            (booing)            

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,300
        Thank you, Sam.         

547
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,900
Thank you all for coming.       

548
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
  Father, on behalf of Gary's   
    Old Towne Tavern,           

549
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,500
    I'd like to present you     
    with a souvenir jacket,     

550
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,000
and we have one                 
for you, too, Kevin,            

551
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
with extra-long sleeves.        

552
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,800
                    Oh, nice!   
Uh-huh.                         

553
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,800
Here's a little check           
for those wonderful kids.       

554
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,400
$5,000, Kevin.                  

555
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,800
$5,000! That's great.           

556
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,500
    Hey Gar, let's get          
    a picture with it.          
That's a great idea.            

557
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,300
Sam, would you get              
out of the way here.            

558
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
You're blocking                 
the check.                      

559
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,600
                     We've got a
                  donation, too.

560
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,600
            Hold on a second.   

561
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,000
            How much            
         have you got?          

562
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,900
     $11 and, uh, 75 cents.     

563
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,100
That's so cute.                 

564
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,800
Uh, gentlemen,                  
I have a bus outside.           

565
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
We can swing by,                
pick up the orphans,            

566
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
and we can drive them           
over to Gary's                  

567
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
for some milk and cookies.      

568
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,300
         What do you think,     
              Father?           

569
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,400
    I think that's fine.        
It's a great idea.              
Come on!                        

570
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
                    You don't   
                understand, man.

571
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,800
                    That $5,000,
            that's our money.   

572
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,100
Shame on you, Sam.              

573
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
You know it's                   
the orphans' money.             

574
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Hey, Gar, thanks a lot          
for the five grand.             

575
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
 Get out of here. I don't want  
to see you again. You're a bum. 

576
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,500
                  Go on. Get out
                    of my place.
                Go on, scoot.   

577
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,800
    Fine. Fine.                 

578
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Eight years of humiliating      
you weenies is enough.          

579
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,800
I'm gonna find a tougher        
gang to humiliate.              

580
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,700
    Hey, you can look           
        all over Boston.        

581
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,700
You won't find any weenies      
        tougher than us!        

582
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,200
                    Yeah, that's
             telling him, Woody.

583
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
              Huh?              

584
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,100
Sam, we've got to               
get back at Gary.               

585
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
              Worse than we ever
                got them before.

586
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,800
                        Come on,
                 let's get Gary.

587
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,600
         Let's get Gary!        
Let's get Gary! Let's get Gary! 

588
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,900
              SAM:              
        Come on...              
Let's get Gary! Let's get Gary!

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,900
                 Aw, don't worry
                    about it.   

590
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,500
        Let's get Gary!         
        Let's get Gary!         

591
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,400
                Come on.        
        What are we doing?      

592
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
          Man, we're pathetic!  

593
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,100
            We've been trying   

594
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,000
  to get Gary for eight years!  

595
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,500
         We never win!          

596
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
                We're pathetic. 

597
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,300
  There's nobody more pathetic  
  than us in the whole world.   

598
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
             Oh, please, Lilith.

599
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,700
                 Anything.      

600
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,400
        A back rub. A handshake.

601
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,100
            Blow me a kiss.     

602
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
              We're not Frasier.
              We're not Frasier.

603
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,800
          (chanting):           
    We're not Frasier!          
    We're not Frasier!          

604
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
       <i>We're not Frasier!</i>       

605
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:20,483
