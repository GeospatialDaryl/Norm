1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,119
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:06,621
(watch beeping)

3
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:10,091
Oh! Good thing I set my watch,
otherwise I would've forgot

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:12,610
something very important I have
to do right at this very minute.

5
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,945
Yeah, what's that, Wood?

6
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:19,617
Did you... need to take
some medication?

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,520
No.

8
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,224
Well, uh... maybe you're
supposed to call somebody, huh?

9
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,826
No. No...

10
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:30,095
Perhaps you had an appointment?

11
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,464
Maybe if I just
don't think about it,

12
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,966
it'll come to me.

13
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,350
I wouldn't worry
about it, Wood.

14
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,619
As you get older, you know,

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,420
the memory starts to go a bit.

16
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,155
Myself, I was
thinking about maybe

17
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,326
signing up for one of
those memory classes.

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,509
That's it, my memory class!

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,614
Today's graduation.

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,103
Oh, where'd I park?

21
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:58,139
Oh, yeah.
See, it's working.

22
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,108

00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,346
♪ Sometimes you want to go ♪

24
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:09,818

Evening, everybody.

30
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,871
ALL:
Norm!

31
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:48,773
How's life treating you, Norm?

32
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:49,888
Well, Sammy, it's not.

33
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,043
So I sure hope you are.

34
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:53,644
Where's Woody?

35
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,163
Oh, his father-in-law
took him and Kelly

36
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,998
to see the Boston Symphony.
Ah!

37
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,199
Probably thought Woody needed

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,001
a little musical culture.
Yeah.

39
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,887
The Boston Symphony is offering
"Mahler's Third" this evening,

40
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,655
one of my absolute favourites.

41
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,493
It always brings salt water
to Lilith's eyes.

42
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:10,261
Tears to you and me,

43
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,331
saline secretions to her.

44
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,318
"Mahler's Third" takes over
an hour and a half by itself.

45
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:19,120
The adagio alone is endless.

46
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,857
I beg your pardon.

47
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,177
Since when do you know anything
about classical music?

48
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,228
Since I was two years old.

49
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,430
My mother was a concert cellist.

50
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,000
I used to turn the pages for her
while she was practicing.

51
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,501
And I loathe Mahler.

52
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:35,253
Well, it must have been
very enriching

53
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,888
to have a mother
who played the cello.

54
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:37,939
Like hell.

55
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,440
Her food tasted like rosin,

56
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,710
and every time I tried to sit
on her lap, I fell through.

57
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,182
Hey, Cliffie, how're you doing?

58
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:49,084
Not well, Sam.

59
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,268
Boy, am I mad!

60
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,137
I've never been this upset!

61
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,373
Boy, three words fellas,

62
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:56,391
three words:

63
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,459
Dames is grief.

64
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,513
Fighting with Ma, huh?

65
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,415
Oh, and how.

66
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,982
It seems like that's
all we do anymore.

67
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,951
You know, you'd think
it'd be a perfect set-up...

68
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,086
mother and a grown son

69
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,454
living in a one
bedroom apartment.

70
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,755
But no.

71
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,259
Reality check, gentlemen.

72
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,403
Life is not like
the movies, I guess, huh?

73
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,881
I'm sure it'll
all blow over, Cliffie.

74
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:21,483
No, no way, Sammy,
not this time.

75
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,285
I tell you that broad's
pushed me too hard.

76
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,786
Too hard, I tell you.

77
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,688
It's about time
I started pushing back.

78
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,856
She's just gone and created
a monster, that's all.

79
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:30,692
But this monster is not gonna

80
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,527
lie in some tomb of ice.

81
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,746
No, sirree.

82
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,298
My anger will melt that ice,
so that I might rise up

83
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,335
and, and crush the Tokyo
of the buildings there

84
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:42,804
beneath the talons
of my animosity...

85
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,639
Cliff, Cliff.

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,374
We all appreciate
how hard you're working

87
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,309
on this metaphor,
but we get the idea.

88
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:54,749
(vocalizing Mahler's
"Symphony No. 3 in D Minor")

89
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,619
What a majestic composer
that Mahler was.

90
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,387
What a piece of work!

91
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:01,022
I'll go upstairs
and see if Melville's

92
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:03,290
is still serving dinner.
SAM: Say, Kelly,

93
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,193
you go to a lot
of those classical...

94
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,761
concert things, don't you?

95
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,062
Do you really enjoy them?

96
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,413
Oh, I love them, Sam.

97
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,049
I just sit there
and let my mind

98
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,818
become a total blank.

99
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,786
How, how do you do that?

100
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,872
How do I do what?

101
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,093
You have a nice dinner, Kelly.

102
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,329
Why don't you order
some protein, sweetheart.

103
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,234
That opening piece,
that gorgeous

104
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:33,270
Dvorjak cello
concerto in, uh...

105
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,872
What was it?
B Minor.

106
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,708
Yes, I thought that was...

107
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,644
Why, Miss Howe.

108
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,645
I'm flabbergasted.

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,963
B Minor's correct.

110
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,432
Believe me, I know.

111
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,401
Well, my compliments.

112
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,902
Obviously, when you've
worked at the house

113
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:49,970
I've failed
to appreciate your depth.

114
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,323
Not to mention her width.

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,328
No, I've always thought

116
00:04:57,362 --> 00:05:00,031
that Mahler was
an acquired taste.

117
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,100
You can say that again.

118
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,018
You know, it was
a shared love for music

119
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,287
which first attracted me
to my ex-wife.

120
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:11,209
Really?

121
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,628
Do you know
"Mahler's Fourth"? (gasps)

122
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:17,915
It's only my fave, that's all.

123
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,601
Hey, Woody, how'd it go, man?

124
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:20,885
Oh, Sam, you're right.
Yeah?

125
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:22,053
As soon as those lights dimmed,

126
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,988
I was sound asleep.

127
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,057
These things really
came in handy. Oh...

128
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:31,730
Yeah, I tell you, these things
bailed me out quite a few times.

129
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,698
Got me through a lot
of heart-to-heart

130
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,633
pillow talk with Diane.

131
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,105
That cello concerto,
it gets everyone!

132
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,007
You know, I stole a look
at the young people

133
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,926
during the allegretto,
and I must admit,

134
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,413
even Woody was displaying
unusual intensity.

135
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,315
KELLY:
Woody.

136
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,750
Woody, they say
we can still eat

137
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,752
if we order right now.

138
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,421
You know, Miss Howe,

139
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,389
I know this is late notice,

140
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,157
but are you free
this Saturday night?

141
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,660
I'm having some people in to
listen to classical music.

142
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,961
This, this, this,
this Saturday?

143
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,296
If you're busy,
I'll understand... No, no!

144
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,098
I, I'm I-I-I'm available.

145
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,933
Oh, splendid.

146
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,435
Shall we say around 7:00?

147
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,704
7:00.
Yeah.

148
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,656
My God!

149
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,659
Did you, did you
just hear what happened?

150
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,160
I certainly did.

151
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:22,363
This incredibly
rich man asked me out.

152
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,931
And-and all this time,
he's just b...

153
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,800
he's been there
right in front of my nose.

154
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,935
Well, congratulations, honey.

155
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,404
(whispers):
I think he loves me.

156
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:32,656
Oh, come- slow down,
will you?

157
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,459
Just slow down. All he did was
ask you for a date.

158
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,211
Well, all Charles
did was ask Diana

159
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,314
if she wanted a cup of tea.

160
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,682
And look how that turned out.

161
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:42,550
Their marriage is in shambles.

162
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:43,701
"Shambles"?

163
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,536
She got three castles
and $80 mil.

164
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,071
I call that happily ever after.

165
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,410
I forgot my purse.

166
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,661
Uh, Kelly?

167
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,530
Kelly, is your, is your dad
seeing anyone special?

168
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,399
No, and I wish he were.

169
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,500
Since the divorce,

170
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,402
he just mopes around the house.

171
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:03,338
I sure wish he'd meet
someone wonderful.

172
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,523
Oh, so do I.

173
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,691
For you, I mean.

174
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:11,228
You know, Kelly,
isn't it rough on you,

175
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,699
not having a mother around?

176
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,836
I mean, you don't
even have a stepmother.

177
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,070
Somebody to chat with,

178
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:23,090
and to share things with,

179
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,826
and to confide
and tell all your

180
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,428
special little secrets to.

181
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:29,046
Boy, I'll say.

182
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,698
Like there's this
thing Woody does

183
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:31,833
when we make love.

184
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,467
Now tell me if you
think this is normal...

185
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,019
Let's just save it.
Let-let...

186
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,388
I think your soup's getting
cold. Come on, honey.

187
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,156
Go on upstairs.
Bye-bye.

188
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,216
Hey, Carla.

189
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,467
Give me a quick coffee,
will you?

190
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,018
I've got some major
driving to do.

191
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,069
Cliffie.

192
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,354
Where've you been
the past few days?

193
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,572
Ah, getting my nerve up.

194
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:56,140
For what?

195
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:57,675
Something drastic.

196
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,493
You and your mom
still fighting?

197
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,095
No, that's, uh...

198
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,731
not a problem anymore.

199
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,100
No, uh, well why, Cliff?
Why not?

200
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:08,252
Well, 'cause I had
all I could take.

201
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,454
Something unpleasant
had to be done.

202
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,924
And it wasn't pretty,
it wasn't easy, but, uh,

203
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,692
she won't be bugging me anymore.

204
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,831
So, what's been
going on around here?

205
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:26,037
Well, Cliff, your ma is still
at your place, isn't she?

206
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:29,190
No, she's, uh, out in the car.

207
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,060
Why didn't you bring her in?

208
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:36,748
Oh, everybody's getting kind
of nosy around here, huh?

209
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,918
You think, uh, we'll talk about
something else, please?

210
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,802
You love talking about your ma.

211
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,272
Hey! Subject closed,
all right?

212
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,206
Aw, forget it.

213
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:49,011
Maybe there aren't so many
"Ma lovers" out in the woods.

214
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,449
I knew this day would come.

215
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:58,085
Clavin whacked his mother.

216
00:08:58,086 --> 00:08:59,087
Come on, Carla.

217
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,888
He said she was
"out in the car."

218
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:03,174
Yeah, and soon she'll be
out in the woods.

219
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,393
Yeah, well, maybe she's getting
her own place, you know?

220
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:08,496
Yeah, she's probably
getting a lot of places.

221
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:11,064
Especially after
the bears dig her up.

222
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,384
Oh, knock it off, Carla.

223
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,319
Cliff didn't kill anybody.

224
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,121
Why not?

225
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:18,856
What do we really
know about him?

226
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,292
We know he is weird.

227
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,744
He's weird, but he's not
that weird.

228
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:25,713
Look, to kill his mother,
he'd have to be some

229
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:29,150
kind of slobbering, degenerate
dual-personality psychopath.

230
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:32,086
Anybody got
a problem with that?

231
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,938
I can't believe
I'm hearing this!

232
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,373
If you really think Cliff is
capable of murdering his mother,

233
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,409
why do you remain his friends?

234
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,377
He's my ride.

235
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,124
Well, here we are.

236
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,759
Oh, Ma!
Look at this!

237
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,979
Even better than the picture
in the brochure.

238
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,681
Yes, I expect I'll be
perfectly delighted

239
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,417
once I stop weeping
and feeling carsick.

240
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,402
Aw, come on, Ma,
the ride wasn't that bad.

241
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:06,737
You drive too fast.

242
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,239
All young people do.

243
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,606
I've often said,

244
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,243
"A lot of needless
accidents could be avoided

245
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:15,529
if they'd just raise
the legal driving age to 50."

246
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,666
Well, I was just
in a hurry to get you

247
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,635
to this beautiful
retirement community.

248
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,604
I'll say.
Talk about luxury, huh?

249
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,572
Oh! That bed, that's,

250
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,441
that's practically
king-sized.

251
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:30,544
King Richard III,
wasn't he the dwarf?

252
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,199
Oh, what do we got here?

253
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,234
Whoa, look at this, Ma!

254
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,970
You've got a beautiful view
of the woods here.

255
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,173
Boy, oh, boy- you know,
when I see a place

256
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,725
like this, I...
I almost wish I was retired.

257
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:49,280
Clifford, are you sure we can
afford a place like this?

258
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,231
Oh, yeah, but don't worry,

259
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,565
your insurance policies
will cover it.

260
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,100
Oh, that's convenient.

261
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:55,802
You'll have money left
for hooch and slatterns.

262
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,704
Oh, come on, Ma.

263
00:10:57,705 --> 00:10:59,740
You know I'm just doing
what's best for you.

264
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,842
(groans):
Come on, Ma.

265
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,894
We've both got to be
strong about this.

266
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,983
I suppose you're right.

267
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:10,384
Well, you're darned
tootin', I'm right.

268
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,953
I mean, you're gonna have
a lot of fun here, Ma.

269
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:15,356
The brochure says the day's
crammed with activities.

270
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,507
You'll play bingo
to your heart's content.

271
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:19,676
You'll make new friends.

272
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:20,861
These are your golden years.

273
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,229
Oh, bless your heart.

274
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,554
You've given me what
every mother dreams of...

275
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,300
a tastefully furnished room

276
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,369
in which to die
among strangers.

277
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,636
Ma, come on.

278
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,505
We're, we're gonna be
strong, remember?

279
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:33,473
Now, is there
anything you need?

280
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,025
Well...

281
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,194
you could keep my garden up.

282
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,964
I think there are
a couple of bags left

283
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,832
of that steer manure
you gave me

284
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,634
last Mothers' Day.

285
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,303
Okay. I'll go do that now.

286
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,272
Bye-bye.

287
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,876
(crying)

288
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,144
Ma, will you stop that?

289
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,929
All right, good-bye.

290
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,816
(sobbing)

291
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,485
Ma!

292
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,520
What? I'm just
standing here.

293
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,905
You're making those noises.

294
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,289
I don't hear any noises.

295
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,741
It must be
your guilty conscience.

296
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,109
You run along.

297
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,044
I expect they'll
be here any minute

298
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,712
to prep me for my lobotomy.

299
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:16,000
Ma, you're not going
to make me feel guilty.

300
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,184
Now, I'm gonna leave,

301
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,504
and I'll see you
next visitors' day.

302
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,155
Bring cigarettes.

303
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,273
They're money
in these places, you know.

304
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,382
Presto.

305
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,935
Wow, that's a nifty gismo
for cracking locks, Carla.

306
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,502
Where'd you get it?
My kid made it

307
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:36,938
in Shop for Mothers' Day.

308
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,040
I don't feel right,

309
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,776
breaking into Cliff's place
like this.

310
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,195
Yeah, well, we've got
to do it now while he's out driving.

311
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,546
It's the only way
we're gonna find out

312
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:46,948
what happened to his mother.

313
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,051
Yeah, besides, it's kind
of exciting, isn't it?

314
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:50,935
You know, I always used
to dream of being

315
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,237
a sophisticated,
international jewel thief,

316
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:56,273
leaping catlike
from balcony to balcony.

317
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:01,645
We've got to see if we can find
any trace of that poor woman.

318
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,114
Look at this place,
give me the creeps.

319
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,801
Look, Paul, go see
what's in there, okay?

320
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,687
Oh, it's just a head.

321
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:10,921
(gasps):
Oh!

322
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:12,089
NORM:
Oh, relax.

323
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,540
It's another word
for "bathroom."

324
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,976
It's an old navy term.

325
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:16,760
You were in the navy?

326
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,530
Mess cook,
that dream came true.

327
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:22,282
Well, go snoop around in there.

328
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,618
See if you can find any
intimate, feminine stuff.

329
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,219
Aye-aye.

330
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:28,956
There's a jar of bubble bath.

331
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,757
Oh, no, that's Cliff's.

332
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,194
Uh, he uses it because he
thinks it keeps dogs

333
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:34,728
from biting him on his route.

334
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,098
Biting him on his what?

335
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,138
When he's out
delivering mail, doofus.

336
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,457
Is there anything
else in there?

337
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,993
Uh, just guy stuff:

338
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:53,064
Soap, toothpaste,
uh, aftershave.

339
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,699
You know what's
weird about this?

340
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,868
This closet has
all Cliff's stuff,

341
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,171
but not even a trace
of any of Ma Clavin's stuff.

342
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,972
Yeah, well what
about this skirt?

343
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,573
Oh, no, that's Cliff's.

344
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,209
It's, uh, it's a kilt.

345
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,044
He wore it to the
Postman's Ball, remember?

346
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,213
"A Night in Glasgow"
was the theme.

347
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,765
This is fiendish.

348
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,767
It's like he's just eliminated

349
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:15,035
all traces of her.

350
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:16,704
It's as though
she never existed.

351
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:18,840
You're right, it is beginning
to get suspicious.

352
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,440
Hey, wait a minute.

353
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:21,942
What's this?

354
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:23,110
Oh, no-no-no,
that's the mail.

355
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,381
Come on, that's private.

356
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,579
Right, like Cliff's

357
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:27,183
never read anyone else's mail.

358
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,517
"Dear Mister Clavin,

359
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:32,552
"I am forwarding you
all your mother's

360
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:35,655
insurance policies
under separate cover."

361
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,175
This is the smoking gun.

362
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,293
Let's get out of here.

363
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:41,795
Too late, he's
coming up the stairs.

364
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,130
(hushed):
Get in the closet. Yeah, yeah.

365
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,198
Go on, get in the closet.

366
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,465
There's not enough
room in here!

367
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,868
NORM:
Well, everybody take a deep breath.

368
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,203
(all inhaling)

369
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,881
Well, I hope you're
satisfied, Clavin.

370
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,556
You've done it now-
the dirty deed.

371
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,461
There's no going back.

372
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,130
So long.

373
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,898
Arrivederci.

374
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:19,133
Sayonara.

375
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,386
Yachsomache.

376
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,424
Oh, who am I kidding?

377
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,228
I can't just pretend and go on
like nothing's happened.

378
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,998
Oh, I've got to talk
to somebody.

379
00:15:34,032 --> 00:15:36,266
Somebody who will
understand me.

380
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:39,070
Somebody who won't condemn me.

381
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,840
Ma, I'm going down to Cheers!

382
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:46,026
Get me...

383
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,064
(all exhaling)

384
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:58,606
Well, it sounds pretty
bad for Ma Clavin.

385
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,906
Let's get out of here.

386
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:00,791
Wait, wait, wait.

387
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,060
No one is going anywhere
until I find out

388
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,778
who had their hands on my butt.

389
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,182
Oh, that was me.

390
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,716
I thought you had gum.

391
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,710
How do I look?

392
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,261
Wow! You're dressed
a little fancy, aren't you,

393
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,914
to go over to some guy's house
and listen to some music?

394
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,817
First of all, it is not a house.

395
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:29,152
It is a stately mansion.

396
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:30,721
And secondly, it is
not "some guy."

397
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:34,124
It is Mr. Gaines,
the man I adore.

398
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,676
"Adore?"

399
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,478
Come on, what are you doing...

400
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,047
You don't even know the
guy's first name, do you?

401
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:41,248
It's Mister.

402
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,252
And if I play my cards
right tonight,

403
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,054
I might just become
Mrs. Mr. Gaines.

404
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:50,140
Just think of it, Sam.

405
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,810
Starting tonight I am no
longer the old Rebecca Howe.

406
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:55,946
I am the new Rebecca Howe.

407
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,548
This is going to
be the start...

408
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:01,452
BOTH:
Of a whole new life for me.

409
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,303
Have I said that before?

410
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:04,623
Only about a thousand times.

411
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,741
BOTH:
Well, this time it's different.

412
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,276
Wow.
Wow.

413
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,796
Honey, you're doing it again.

414
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,931
You're going completely
overboard.

415
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,000
You do this time and time again.

416
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,670
And I just, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

417
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,308
You're right.

418
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,110
I'm rushing into
things again, aren't I?

419
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,011
Yeah.

420
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,147
Listen, listen, it-it's just
a simple date, right?

421
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:32,649
You're going over
to a guy's house

422
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,217
and you listen
to a little music.

423
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:36,153
That's right, I'm just
listening to a little music.

424
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:37,220
Yeah.

425
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:39,422
And I do like
some classical music.

426
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,892
I, I... maybe they'll play
Wagner. I like Wagner.

427
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,227
What's that catchy little tune

428
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,761
that he has that I like?

429
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,097
Oh, I know.

430
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:50,634
(hums "Wedding March")

431
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,403
You're doing it...

432
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:58,275
Sam, you busy?

433
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,743
Who is it?

434
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,078
It's Cliff.

435
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,247
Then, yeah.

436
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,033
Thanks, Sam.

437
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:12,272
Hey, I, uh, I'm really
upset about something.

438
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,340
I, just need your advice, pal.

439
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,426
Cliff, Cliff.

440
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:19,231
They, they make fun of you
because they love you, okay?

441
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,817
Uh, thanks, Sam, but, uh, uh...

442
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,203
that's not really
why I came in here.

443
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,506
Oh. Then, why?

444
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,608
Well, Sam, I want
to talk about Ma.

445
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,546
We've been fighting
a lot lately,

446
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,881
and, uh, we've decided

447
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,116
(voice breaking):
That she should go live

448
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,634
in a retirement community.

449
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:44,170
(sobbing): And, aw, Sammy, I'm
the worst son in the world!

450
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:47,440
Oh, man, hey, uh, listen,

451
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:49,142
all-all, all families...

452
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,544
Do me a favor, do you want
to sit on the desk?

453
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,432
All right.

454
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,000
Uh, all-all families go
through this, Cliffie.

455
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,102
Uh, you know, I think you're
doing the right thing.

456
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:01,738
Uh, uh, you know, you know,

457
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,907
I'll bet she's going
to be real happy, right?

458
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,375
I mean, you picked
a nice place.

459
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:06,493
Oh, yeah.

460
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:07,878
A real nice place.

461
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,212
Famous, too.

462
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,181
It was profiled on 60 Minutes.

463
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,286
You know, a couple weeks later,

464
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:18,038
they went back
and did a follow-up even.

465
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,925
There you go, Cliff.
Yeah.

466
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,927
Yeah, I guess you're right, Sam.

467
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,928
I still feel a little
bit guilty, though.

468
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,913
Yeah, well, uh, you know,
there's no need for that.

469
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,749
I think you're doing
the right thing, pal.

470
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,768
Hey, thanks, Sam.

471
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,002
Listen, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread it around,

472
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:34,771
you know, this little
talk we had here.

473
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,241
I only told you because
we're best friends.

474
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,509
Well, fair enough.

475
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:42,614
You know, but maybe we shouldn't
spread that around, either.

476
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:46,382
I'm with you, Sam.
All right.

477
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,621
I'll, uh, be back
in a while there, Woody.

478
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:54,625
Just remembered a job I have
to take care of at home.

479
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,210
All right, Mr. Clavin.

480
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:57,378
Hey, Cliff...

481
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:59,263
(all gasping)

482
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:03,017
Oh, it's, uh, nice
to see you guys, too. Yeah.

483
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:04,802
So, uh, where,
where've you been?

484
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,170
Oh, here, there...
everywhere, you know.

485
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,306
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.

486
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,443
Oh, yeah, save a beer
for me, will you?

487
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,362
Hey, where's he going?
Well, he said he had a job

488
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,064
to take care of at home.

489
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:19,933
Yeah- a little digging
in the backyard, maybe.

490
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,819
Getting rid
of the murder weapon.

491
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,186
Come on, Carla.

492
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:24,821
I can't believe you people
are still pursuing

493
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,690
that paranoid fantasy
about Cliff.

494
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,043
It's no fantasy, Frasier.

495
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:30,337
And isn't it interesting

496
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:33,163
that you're the one
who keeps defending him?

497
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,998
Well, I'm not defending him.
I'm merely saying...

498
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,668
Where is Lilith
these days, anyhow?

499
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:41,805
Has anyone here heard
from Lilith lately?

500
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,390
Oh, come on, Carla, lay off.

501
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,060
And what about Vera, Norm?
Where is Vera?

502
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:50,097
Carla...
And has anyone ever seen Paul's alleged ex?

503
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,731
You're all sick.

504
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,901
It's an evil conspiracy.

505
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:55,653
A bunch of frustrated men

506
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,987
who slaughter women

507
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,456
and then chop up their bodies
in the dead of night!

508
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:02,726
Oh, man!

509
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,561
I'd better
have a date pretty soon

510
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,429
or I'm gonna start
turning weird.

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,120
(piano playing
gentle, classical melody)

512
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:16,106
(singing in Italian)

513
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,349
Why, Miss Howe

514
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,051
I was just beginning
to worry about you.

515
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,854
Oh, please, call me Rebecca.

516
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,639
What a lovely home you have.

517
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:35,775
So many possibilities.

518
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,027
Why, thank you.

519
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,795
You should enjoy yourself
this evening.

520
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,347
We're having
an all-Mahler program.

521
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:42,282
Oh, wonderful.

522
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:45,185
Yes. I've hired
a very gifted German baritone.

523
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:48,155
He'll be performing Mahler's
"Kindertotenleider,"

524
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:50,124
songs on the death of children.

525
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:53,476
Well, if we don't have fun
tonight, we never will.

526
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:54,811
Yes, and you should be able

527
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:56,280
to hear adequately
from your station,

528
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,581
where you'll be
performing your duties.

529
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:00,884
My station?

530
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,069
Yes. You'll be tending bar
just through that door.

531
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,338
You know, we didn't have
a chance to discuss your wages.

532
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,606
Now I want to be fair.

533
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,592
My station? My duties?

534
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,826
Uh, Hives, here,
has your apron.

535
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,312
Hives? He'll explain
your duties.

536
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:13,764
I'll start off
with a white wine.

537
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,017
My station? My duties?
My apron?

538
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:18,902
Fancy dress.

539
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,706
Hives, I-I think there's
been a terrible mistake here.

540
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,807
You see, I-I think
I was supposed to be

541
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:26,276
Mister Gaines' date
for this evening.

542
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,013
Really! Oh, they'll love that
in the kitchen.

543
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,967
Thank you.

544
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:36,703
You're very kind.

545
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,992
(sobbing)

546
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,737
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry to hear that.

547
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:56,790
I-I'll be over as soon as I can.

548
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,208
Who was that?

549
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,627
Aw, it's Rebecca.
She's all upset.

550
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,463
Your father-in-law invited her
over to his place

551
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,899
to, uh, listen
to a musicale tonight.

552
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,601
She thought she was
supposed to be his date...

553
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:10,436
got all dressed up
in a fancy dress.

554
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:13,140
Turns out she's only there
to tend bar.

555
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,476
How could she make that mistake?

556
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,443
Oh, come on, Woody.

557
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:17,911
Put yourself in her position.

558
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,547
You know, attractive guy
asks you over to his place

559
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:22,916
to listen to some music, wants
you to wear a fancy dress...

560
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,151
you'd go, wouldn't you?

561
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,318
Oh, no! No.

562
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,654
My high school drama teacher
tried that one on me.

563
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:30,323
Once bitten, twice shy,
my friend.

564
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,267
Maybe I'm misreading this.

565
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,537
Maybe this really is a date.

566
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:06,142
No, it isn't!

567
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:08,945
Two red wines.

568
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,484
And do try to pour them evenly
this time.

569
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,303
(imitating):
Do try to pour them evenly.

570
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,774
(dogs snarling and barking)

571
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,897
Oh sweetheart, sweetheart.

572
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:03,166
Oh, I came as soon
as you called, honey.

573
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,717
(sobbing) Oh, baby.

574
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:07,254
I don't blame you
for being disappointed.

575
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,605
I'm not disappointed!

576
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,642
Well...
I'm humiliated.

577
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,045
I thought- this is
what really hurts me...

578
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,481
I thought he really liked me.

579
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:22,152
Oh, Sam, you need
to... you need to...

580
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,054
you need to stand in
for me tonight please.

581
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,022
I'm too embarrassed.

582
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,390
I can't go out there again.

583
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,223
I know. I know.

584
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,357
All right, I tell you what,

585
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:31,111
uh, let me just...
collect some empties.

586
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:32,762
Here we go.

587
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:34,864
I'll take over
as soon as I get back.

588
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,299
All right?
Thank you.

589
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,008
You're kidding, Sam.

590
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,143
Miss Howe thought
this was to be a date?

591
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:48,178
Yes, sir.

592
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,146
And, uh, to tell you
the truth, sir,

593
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,000
I heard what you said and I...
and I thought the same thing.

594
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:56,319
You did? My Lord.

595
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:59,355
Although- and I don't mean
this in any way personally

596
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,770
you'll have to admit you are

597
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,393
far from the brightest person
in the world.

598
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,912
True. That's-that's-that's
very true, sir.

599
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:09,716
Um, you know, Rebecca's
been looking forward

600
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,718
to this evening the whole week.

601
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:15,188
And, between you and me, sir,
she finds you very attractive

602
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:18,758
and I think she thought
the feeling was mutual.

603
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,026
Miss Howe is attracted to me?

604
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,745
I had no idea.

605
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:25,949
You see, son, I am not exactly
what you'd call a ladies' man.

606
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:29,118
Well, if you don't mind, sir,
uh...

607
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:32,155
have you ever considered
that it might be your hair?

608
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:38,928
Sam, why don't you go in the bar
and relieve Rebecca.

609
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:40,363
Send her out here, and I'll, uh,

610
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,549
try to make it up to her
by having her as my guest.

611
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,733
Oh, thank you, sir.

612
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:45,001
That's... I think that's
the right thing to do.

613
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,503
We'll talk later...
Yes.

614
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,544
Okay. Everybody
stand up straight.

615
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,246
Wh-what are
you doing?

616
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:59,850
Well, I'm taking
some of the wine out of these bottles

617
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,561
so that when I pour them
in the glasses they'll be even.

618
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:06,856
How much have you had to drink?

619
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,459
In my life or tonight?

620
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,211
Tonight.

621
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,462
Well, that's hard to say,

622
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:16,199
because I've been drinking.

623
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,719
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

624
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,088
Oh, boy, oh, boy what?

625
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,823
Mister Gaines just realized
his mistake and he wants,

626
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:26,459
he wants you to be his date
for the rest of the evening.

627
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,144
He does?

628
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,413
Oh, he loves me again!

629
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:35,652
Oh, my ship has come in.

630
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,387
Not yet. Not yet it hasn't.

631
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:39,389
We-we're gonna have
to sober you up, sweetheart.

632
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,857
Okay, then give me a Tic Tac.

633
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:45,862
No, no, we're, uh,
we're way beyond Tic Tacs.

634
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,196
Oh, we are?
Yeah.

635
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:48,698
Okay. Oh, God! Oh, no.
Oh, you know what?

636
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,066
You're gonna have
to help me here

637
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,268
because I can't let Mister
Gaines see me like this

638
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:54,036
because he's gonna
think I'm drunk.

639
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,705
Yeah. Uh...
Now you have been drunk before.

640
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:58,374
So what did you used to do when
you used to try and get sober?

641
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,710
Well, I had, uh...
yeah, actually I did.

642
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:04,647
I had this little trick and it-
it kind of hurts, but it works.

643
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,485
Okay. What is it?

644
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,659
Honey, uh, I te...

645
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,383
I've got to get
some coffee in you.

646
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,113
I'll be right there.

647
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:27,187
Well, Norm?

648
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:28,454
Well, nothing.

649
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,623
I just keep getting
Cliff's answering machine.

650
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:32,125
No word of his ma

651
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,777
or any forwarding
address or anything.

652
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,428
Well, that's weird.

653
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:40,283
You know what's weirder
is-is the outgoing message.

654
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:42,552
You know for years how
it was Cliff and his ma

655
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,156
singing "Come
On'a My House?"

656
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:47,874
Well, now it's just Cliff.

657
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,043
And I gotta tell you,
I miss that harmony.

658
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,745
Come on, you guys...

659
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,732
you can't really believe
that Cliff killed his mother.

660
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,518
Hey, everybody.

661
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:07,661
What's in the,
uh, sacks, Cliff?

662
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,630
Oh, just some old things
of Ma's, getting rid of them.

663
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:15,836
I just can't stand to have them
around the house anymore.

664
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:23,059
Cliff, uh, you've been acting,
oh, a little strange lately.

665
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,462
Is there- is there
anything on your mind

666
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,296
that you'd like to, uh, just...

667
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:31,167
Say is that- is that dirt
underneath your nails?

668
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:37,139
Yeah. I've been spending a lot
of time in the garden lately.

669
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:41,478
Can't get my hands clean.

670
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:44,964
I-I wash them and wash them.

671
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:49,702
Yes, but, uh, Cliff,
is-is there a-anything

672
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:53,339
on-on your mind y-you'd
like to talk to me about?

673
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,941
I don't want to talk, Doc.

674
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:57,510
Uh, I want to watch television.

675
00:29:57,544 --> 00:30:00,546
See if there's anything
on the news.

676
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,003
Dare you to look inside.

677
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:09,405
Dare you.

678
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,924
Somebody's got to look.

679
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,008
Not me.

680
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,211
I've seen enough body parts
to choke a horse.

681
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:16,680
Literally, in one case.

682
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:24,170
(piano playing classical music)

683
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,862
Ah, Miss Howe.

684
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:35,081
I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding.

685
00:30:35,115 --> 00:30:37,300
No misunderstanding taken.

686
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:41,404
Uh, everyone, may I have
your attention please? (music stops)

687
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,323
I'd like to introduce my
date for this evening,

688
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,674
Miss Rebecca Howe.

689
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,493
Hello.

690
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:48,161
Good evening.

691
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:50,130
Thank you for dropping by.

692
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:52,098
GAINES:
You're looking very lovely

693
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:53,383
this evening, Rebecca.

694
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,018
And so are you, Mister.

695
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,361
Well,

696
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,163
shall we begin our
Kindergarten Teeter Tooter?

697
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:10,933
Delightful.

698
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
(piano playing classical music)

699
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:22,929
(baritone begins singing)

700
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,149
(humming along
off-key)

701
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,621
(humming along
off-key)

702
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:51,291
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

703
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,259
(mouths):
I'm sorry.

704
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,039
(singing along in
foreign language)

705
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:09,659
(music stops)

706
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Look, look, I'm sorry.

707
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,128
I cannot concentrate!

708
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:13,730
I can't either!

709
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:16,766
Now, listen, let me just
tell you people one thing.

710
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,021
Raymond Burr came a long way
to entertain us.

711
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:23,223
And I think

712
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:26,776
out of courtesy to him,
we should keep our mouths shut!

713
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,162
Miss Howe, you are
obviously inebriated.

714
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:30,196
Now, you're
embarrassing yourself,

715
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,230
you're embarrassing me.

716
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:32,932
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

717
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:33,933
(whispers):
Oh, no, no, no.

718
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:35,018
Please, don't do that.

719
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,404
This means so much to me.

720
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,506
Please, I don't know,
I've heard this a million times,

721
00:32:39,507 --> 00:32:41,140
and I don't know,
it's just so catchy.

722
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:43,109
I never noticed before.

723
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,344
Please, please,
just-just let me stay.

724
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:48,269
I-I promise, if you let me stay,
I won't sing one more note.

725
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,819
Very well.

726
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:58,541
(piano playing classical music)

727
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,737
(man singing opera
in foreign language)

728
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,586
(man hits high note)

729
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,273
(sings off-key high note)

730
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:15,624
I'll tell you Carla,
Rebecca's doing great.

731
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,160
Yeah, I was
a little worried, too.

732
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,031
But you know,
she's fitting right in.

733
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,930
You know, I-I would
not be surprised

734
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,083
if you heard wedding bells.

735
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:24,383
Do me a favour, will you?

736
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:27,119
Uh, you got to cover me for
a while at the bar, you know.

737
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,121
No, no-no, there's-there's
no way you could,

738
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:30,623
you could drag Rebecca
out of here.

739
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,758
(clattering)

740
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,461
Oh, hey, fellas.

741
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:35,962
Hold on a second.

742
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:37,046
How you doing?

743
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,565
(dogs barking outside)

744
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,867
The-the whole point is that...

745
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:42,201
See, uh, the whole...

746
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:43,386
Hold-hold on. I...

747
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,605
The dogs are making
a racket here.

748
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,575
You know, boy, they're really
chasing someone out there.

749
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:55,281
You know, from here, from here,
it almost looks like...

750
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,548
Oh.

751
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,633
Oh, my God.

752
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:09,412
REPORTER:
...witness news, including the latest

753
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,283
sports and weather
right after this.

754
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,033
Cliff, listen,
just one more time.

755
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:15,668
Are you sure there's
not something

756
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,503
you'd like to get
off your chest?

757
00:34:20,941 --> 00:34:23,209
Oh, all right, Doc.
I might as well tell you.

758
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:25,795
Yeah.

759
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:29,699
I sent Ma off to
a retirement community.

760
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,384
A retirement community.

761
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:33,219
CLIFF:
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,254
One hell of a son, huh?

763
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:37,056
Boy, I don't know why I did it.

764
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,491
You know...

765
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:42,094
I think I'm gonna go down there
today and bring her back home.

766
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,462
I mean, that's
if she'll have me.

767
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,964
Good for you, Cliff.

768
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:47,851
Retirement home-
I, I knew it.

769
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,652
And you guys thought
he killed his mother!

770
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:50,886
(laughs)

771
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,105
Thought what?

772
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,839
Nothing.

773
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:54,924
What?

774
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:56,276
Ah!

775
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,611
Well, I guess we
ought to tell him.

776
00:34:58,612 --> 00:34:59,645
Yeah.

777
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:01,247
Uh, Cliffie, uh,

778
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,815
you're gonna get a kick
out of this, actually.

779
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:04,017
(Paul, Carla, Norm laughing)

780
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,234
See,

781
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,852
what we thought was that...

782
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:09,322
Oh, hell, what's the best way
to put this, guys?

783
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,907
We thought you killed your mom
and cut her up in little pieces.

784
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:12,975
Beer?

785
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,913
Boy, this is terrific.

786
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,817
And you're supposed
to be my friends.

787
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:20,749
How could you think
of something like that?

788
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,834
Come on, Cliff.

789
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:23,118
Yeah, we're sorry, Mr. Clavin.

790
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,338
Ah, no, I mean,
that's a real rotten thing!

791
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:26,706
Oh, Cliff, in the
bottom of our hearts,

792
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,674
none of us really thought you
actually killed your mother.

793
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:29,875
No! Golly!
(all chuckling)

794
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:31,561
NORM:
Come on, I mean, you know,

795
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,678
how could we think that?

796
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,829
You're our buddy.
Yeah.

797
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,681
Come on, we love
you, Cliffie, huh?

798
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,283
Huh?
(all chuckling)

799
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:38,517
REPORTER:
This just in.

800
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:41,421
Gardeners have just discovered
human remains

801
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:42,788
in the middle
of Lexington Common.

802
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:43,856
Get him!

803
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,741
(all grunting)

804
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:48,461
Authorities believe the remains
may be those of a minute-man

805
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,979
who fought in
the Revolutionary War.

806
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:52,081
Ah!
Hey, Cliffie.

807
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:53,516
(all chuckling) Come on.

808
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,652
That's just a sample of how
much we love you, Cliffie.

809
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,094
Uh, excuse me.

810
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,196
My name's Clavin, and I,
uh, brought my mother

811
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:08,264
in here earlier today.

812
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,549
And now you're having
pangs of remorse.

813
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,251
(chuckles):
Yeah. How'd you know?

814
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,670
It's a common reaction.

815
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,972
It's quite normal.

816
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:16,905
Yeah, yeah.

817
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:19,024
Well, uh,
I-I guess I'll be, uh,

818
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,276
taking my ma home now.

819
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,611
I'm sorry to hear that.

820
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:24,213
I-I just went over
to her, uh, room there,

821
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:25,431
and-and she wasn't around so...

822
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,366
She's in the Starlight Lounge.

823
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,784
There's a dance tonight.

824
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:30,620
(waltz music playing faintly)

825
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,826
(waltz music playing)

826
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:40,630
Wow!

827
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,966
I don't remember
the last time I saw Ma dancing.

828
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,086
People often seem to come
out of their shells here.

829
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,170
Hey, look at that.

830
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:49,489
Guy just cut in on her.

831
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,308
That silver-haired fox.

832
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:53,392
(chuckles):
Yes.

833
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,062
I was watching your mother
in the hot tub earlier.

834
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:59,765
She seemed to be quite popular
with the gentlemen.

835
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:02,518
You, uh, you have a hot tub?

836
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:05,655
Oh, yes. Our residents
find it quite invigorating.

837
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:07,323
After the softball tournament.

838
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,224
Softball tournament.

839
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,608
In fact,

840
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:13,529
this afternoon, your mother
was chosen most valuable player.

841
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:16,782
She went four for four at bat.

842
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:18,768
But I think it was
the hook slide into third

843
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,202
that really won their hearts.

844
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:23,539
My mother's never played
softball in her life.

845
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,457
(music stops, applause)
Maybe she never had the chance.

846
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,310
(tango music playing)

847
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,415
Oh.

848
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,665
(chuckles):
Come here, come here.

849
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,368
Look at this, look at this.

850
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:38,003
She's doing a tango.

851
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:40,005
She's got a rose in her
teeth and everything.

852
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:41,073
(laughs)

853
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:43,075
I just hope she doesn't
fall off that table.

854
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:44,576
Ah, it's okay.

855
00:37:44,577 --> 00:37:47,113
She got eight guys waiting
there to catch her if she does.

856
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:48,347
(laughs)

857
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:50,900
Oh, boy, I've never
seen her so happy.

858
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,968
I, uh...

859
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:54,136
(chuckles)

860
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,472
Got to say, I-I feel
kind of foolish.

861
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:57,573
Don't.

862
00:37:57,574 --> 00:37:59,775
You just wanted what was
best for your mother.

863
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:00,709
Yeah.

864
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,478
Well, I always thought
that her world

865
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,946
revolved around
her son, you know,

866
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,149
that she couldn't, uh, ever
get along without me, so...

867
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,200
Perhaps that's what
you wanted to think.

868
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,654
Yeah.

869
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:14,557
Now I can see she's happier
than she's ever been.

870
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:16,075
(chuckles)

871
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:17,776
Say, uh, I'd appreciate it

872
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:20,012
if you didn't mention
that I was here.

873
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,430
I understand.

874
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,899
I guess I won't be
taking her home after all.

875
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:25,050
I thought not.

876
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:26,218
Yeah.

877
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:28,821
Yeah, I'm just gonna
go have another peek.

878
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:30,156
Oh, and-and, Mr. Clavin,

879
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,024
while you're here,
your mother's insurance

880
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:33,843
doesn't entirely cover
her expenses.

881
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,894
(chuckles)

882
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:35,978
I assume that, uh,

883
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,729
you'll want to take care
of the remainder?

884
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,730
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.

885
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:39,932
Just send me the bill.

886
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,501
Well, here's what it comes to
for the first year.

887
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:44,270
Honestly, the cost
of running this place

888
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:46,889
just keeps going up and up.

889
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,275
Well, you can't put a price
on a mother's happiness.

890
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:51,210
(chuckles)

891
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:03,014
(screaming):
Oh, Clifford!

892
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:04,022
Put me down!

893
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:05,113
What are you doing?!

894
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,235
I'm getting you
out of this hell hole, Ma!

895
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,565
Here you go.

896
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,533
Thank you, Sam.

897
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:18,371
Feeling better?

898
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:20,606
(sighs)

899
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,325
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

900
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,295
I can't believe I did that.

901
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,764
Do you know what I am?

902
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,431
I'm a phony.

903
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:32,201
I'm a great big phony.

904
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,170
Pretending like I liked Mahler

905
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,839
just so some rich guy
would ask me out.

906
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,374
I don't even
know his first name.

907
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,592
WOODY:
Gustav.

908
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,310
Gustav Mahler.

909
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,316
(sighs)

910
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,853
Do you know that I don't
really even like Mr. Gaines?

911
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:53,789
And yet I allowed myself
to just fall all over him

912
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,441
just because he's rich.

913
00:39:55,475 --> 00:39:58,511
As God as my witness, Sam,

914
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:02,548
I am never, ever
going af-after

915
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,534
another rich man
as long as I live.

916
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,919
Well, as far as
I can see, Normie,

917
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,755
we're-we're sitting pretty.

918
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,292
I mean, I don't, I don't
foresee any problems unless...

919
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:16,262
well, unless of course there's
a second wave of Martians.

920
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:21,032
Then, uh, then, my friend,
I think we've got

921
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:23,869
some pretty serious
defence problems.

922
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:27,105
But, oh, uh, heck, I'll go
into that some other time.

923
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:33,962
(yawning):
Want a refill, Norm?

924
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:35,231
Norm.

925
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:36,432
Hey, Norm.

926
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:46,958
Oh.

927
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:48,894
There you are, Miss Howe.

928
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:51,096
Uh, Mr. Gaines,

929
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,531
I have to apologize.

930
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,566
No, don't say a thing.

931
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:58,036
I admit, I was upset by what
happened earlier this evening.

932
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,139
But after I cooled down,
I realized it was all my fault.

933
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,541
I was unclear
about my intentions.

934
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,176
Now I'd like to
make it up to you.

935
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,512
I thought we could have dinner
sometime, together,

936
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:07,763
just the two of us.

937
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:11,233
Just you and me?

938
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:12,735
Yes.

939
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:15,899
I'd be delighted to have dinner
with such an attractive woman.

940
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:28,934
Sorry, Mr. Gaines.

941
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,905
Um, I'm very flattered,
but I have to tell you

942
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:35,140
that the only reason
I would have dinner with you

943
00:41:35,141 --> 00:41:38,544
is because you're so rich.

944
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:40,045
And that wouldn't be
fair to you,

945
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:41,513
and it wouldn't be fair to me.

946
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:43,882
I see.

947
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:48,620
Very well, Miss Howe.

948
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:49,722
Good-bye.

949
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:52,407
Good-bye.

950
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:59,915
Well, Rebecca,
I must say I'm impressed.

951
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:02,017
This could be a big
turning point in your life.

952
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:04,519
At last, your actions
fit your words.

953
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,554
Yeah, I'm with Frasier.

954
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,556
I'm really proud of you,
sweetheart.

955
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,691
Thank you, I appreciate it.

956
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,861
Sam, can you come here
and do me a favour?

957
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:13,763
Sure, hon. What?

958
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,232
Can you stop me from
going after him?

959
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,367
I'm having a hard time
stopping myself.

960
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:19,468
(chuckles)

961
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:20,569
Whoa.

962
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,204
And you're gonna need
Cliff and Norm.

963
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,423
SAM:
Uh, Norm, Norm?

964
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:28,644
Fras, you want to help me here?

965
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:31,580
Mister. Mister!

966
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:32,898
I'm coming, Mister!

967
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:34,316
Mister!

968
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,001
Mister!
