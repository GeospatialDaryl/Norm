1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,878
RESCUE ME

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,314
Say, aren't you Ernie Pantusso?

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,630
- Are you talking to me, sir?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,758
- Yes, l am.
- Well, l'll be damned.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,151
- Do you remember me?
- No, l'm sorry. l don't.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,629
- Let me give you a hint.
- l like hints.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,234
Shortstop.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,039
Topeka, 1 94 7.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,111
My nickname was ''Fancy Dan''.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,998
Joe Pitney!

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,993
No, Ernie. l'm Dan Corelli.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,835
Danny Corelli!
My God, am l happy to see you!

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,513
Everybody, listen up.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,592
This is one of the most
amazing men in the world.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,275
One of the most amazing men that ever
stepped into a baseball diamond.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,910
He was a great ball-player.
l know, l played against him.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,231
But, listen, the man is totally blind!

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,555
- l'm not blind and l never was.
- Come on, Corelli, don't be modest.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,632
You were a legend.
You were an absolute legend.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,793
The whole league talked about
the blind man who played for Topeka.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,032
You're all confused.
They called me the Blind Man

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,159
because l sold venetian blinds
door-to-door during the off season.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,760
My God, how did he find the doorbell?

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,075
ls that an inspirational story or not?

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,472
They didn't buy your product out of pity,
l'm telling you.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,395
- l'll see you later.
- Watch the steps there, please!

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,639
l think he can see as well as we can.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,236
Carla, in some ways, he can see more.

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,709
- Thanks for the hot tip.
- What are you talking about?

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,316
You said Vera's cousin Natalie
would go out with me.

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,473
l didn't say she'd go out with you.
l said she'd go out with anyone.

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,313
l called her and she shot me down.

33
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,632
lt doesn't make any sense.
Vera said this woman was desperate.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,677
What did you say?

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,116
l said hello, did my icebreaker joke,
and asked her out.

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
What was your icebreaker joke?

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,037
- A cute little pervert imitation l do.
- What?

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,555
Not pervert,
more like an obscene phone call.

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,679
Heavy breathing and all.
Ma roars at it.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,035
Hello, Natalie.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,350
What are you wearing?

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,715
You wanna know what l'm...

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,598
Yeah, sure.
Tomorrow you're all gonna be using it.

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,393
Everyone raves about this place.
The chef is a genius.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,431
l'm so glad we got a reservation.

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,751
- l want tonight to be perfect.
- lt will be.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,198
l'm gonna get the best table, no matter
how many palms l have to cross.

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,918
<i>Buona notte.</i>

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,036
Crane, party of two.

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,519
Crane?

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,672
Ah, Crane.

52
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,274
- <i>Signore</i>, please, this way.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,715
l'd like the finest table you have.

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,552
Something quiet, near the...

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,596
Any place is fine.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,835
lf the food's so good, why is it empty?

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,831
l don't know.

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,193
Welcome to Luigi's.

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,512
Our world-renowned chef, Luigi,
would like to welcome you personally,

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,478
but he's dead.

61
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,109
We buried him this morning.
ls this table satisfactory?

62
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,396
This morning? And you're open?

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,792
Yes. lt was one of Luigi's last wishes.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,755
- Would it be easier on you if we left?
- No, no, no!

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,391
The new man is a very fine cook.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,953
He studied under...
the world's greatest chef.

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,512
Stay. Stay, <i>prego.</i>

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,468
Well, we're very hungry.
Can you recommend an appetizer?

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,110
Yes, the <i>Calamari alla Luigi...</i>

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,277
is very good.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,231
Well, we'll have an order of that
and a bottle of your best chianti.

72
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,320
Boy, can l show a girl a good time.

73
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,313
Frasier, don't feel bad. lt's not your fault.

74
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,634
l don't know. The harder l try
to please you, the more l mess up.

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,191
l wanted tonight to be perfect
so that l could ask you to marry me.

76
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,316
How you talk!

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,996
Dr Marino arranged for us to marry
tomorrow at his estate in Florence.

78
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,195
You're serious.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,399
Well, Diane, this trip
has put us to the test.

80
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,358
l've seen you at your best
and your worst.

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,398
l didn't think your worst
was all that bad.

82
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,552
Especially when it was
only in small doses.

83
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,717
The more l know you,

84
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,232
the more l want you.

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,949
Will you marry me and make me
the happiest man in the world?

86
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,675
Frasier, l'm so nervous.

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,272
l didn't have the slightest indication
this was coming.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,639
Well, of course, my...

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,429
Look what l've done.
May l have your napkin?

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,795
l'll be right back.

91
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,995
Fancy answering machine, Sam.

92
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,674
Deluxe model, top of the line.

93
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,149
l can't talk to answering machines.

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,915
And you're such a whiz with people.

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,790
You think it's a convenience but
it's a poor substitute for a human being.

96
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,157
- You should trash it.
- This is an expensive machine.

97
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,993
l'm talking about Carla.

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,310
Like to see her top that one.

99
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,399
TouchÃ©!

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,118
l'm not much for these things.
Why do you need one?

101
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,829
l've been missing calls.
People screw up messages.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,798
We always get your messages right.

103
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,669
Think we're too stupid
to take a message?

104
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,478
That hurts, Sam.

105
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,110
Sorry, but l think it's better
to have a machine.

106
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,272
Does anyone know
how to record on this?

107
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,670
You press that little red button.

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,638
Talk right into the machine.
Keep it simple.

109
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,316
Tell them to leave names and numbers.
l'll make jungle noises in the background.

110
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,909
Quiet for a second, everybody.

111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,910
Hi, this is Sam Malone.

112
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,392
Suckered you in. l'm not here.
Do you like talking to a machine?

113
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,439
At the beep, leave your name, number,
and something that'll get me hot.

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,909
Hope that was for your private line.

115
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,038
l wouldn't waste a bon mot like that
on business stuff.

116
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,998
- Would someone get that for me?
- Well, gee, l'll try.

117
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,718
Hello?

118
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,792
- Wanna help me, guys?
- Yeah. Hello?

119
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,997
- Hello. Come in?
- Cheers.

120
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,357
- Hello, it's me.
- Hold on a second.

121
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,709
Been dreaming about me again?

122
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,111
Actually, l'm calling to talk to everyone.

123
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,989
Chat a little.
Tell you how nice the weather's been.

124
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,436
How romantic Europe has been.

125
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,636
Yes, it's been very romantic.

126
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,758
The kind of place
that makes a man lose his head

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,230
and propose to a gal
on a night such as this.

128
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
So, who do you wanna speak to next?

129
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,470
l'm talking about Frasier.

130
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,236
He had a couple of sips of chianti tonight
and asked me to marry him.

131
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,994
Did you say a couple of sips or barrels?

132
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,399
- l knew you'd be this way.
- No, l'm not being any way.

133
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,755
So what'd you tell him?

134
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,072
l haven't told him anything yet.
l'm just basking in the moment.

135
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,629
l see.

136
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,191
So what's the problem? You told me
you and Frasier are a perfect match.

137
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,191
There's no problem.

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,150
Tell everyone that l'll call
after the wedding tomorrow.

139
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,073
Tomorrow? What's the rush?

140
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,279
Frasier has thoughtfully and romantically
arranged for us to be married

141
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,396
at the Marino estate.

142
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,475
lt's a landmark, one of the most
beautiful estates in Florence.

143
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,393
So are you gonna say yes?

144
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,034
You think l should say something else?

145
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,593
No.

146
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,672
No, you don't think
l should say something else,

147
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,752
or no, you think l should say no?

148
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,638
Yes.

149
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,836
Yes, l should say yes,
or yes, l should say something else?

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,231
Congratulations. l'm very happy for you.

151
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,630
l see. lf you have
nothing more to say,

152
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,360
l'd better be getting back to Frasier.

153
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,479
You probably want to accept
before he sobers up.

154
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,358
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

155
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,473
What's wrong, Sam?

156
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,237
Diane is gonna marry Frasier
tomorrow in Florence.

157
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,039
Sam, free at last!

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,749
How about a little sensitivity?
He's broken up.

159
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,198
lf Diane says she's in love with
Frasier and wants to marry him,

160
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,749
l'm happy for her.
She got what she wanted.

161
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,117
Maybe she called so you could
talk her out of marrying him.

162
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,998
No, she wanted to gloat.

163
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,675
She wanted you to tell her
you care for her.

164
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,877
You bet.
So that she could laugh in my face.

165
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,477
But l didn't fall for her little trick,
so l get to laugh in her face.

166
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,829
Hear me? l'm laughing.

167
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,911
- The man is a rock.
- From the neck up.

168
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,914
Hello, Diane. l was just
ordering the chef's special.

169
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,636
What took you so long?

170
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,114
Frasier, l was overwhelmed.
l needed a little time to myself.

171
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,198
Now l know what my answer
was all along.

172
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,430
Yes, l'll marry you.

173
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,948
Diane, you've made me so happy.

174
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,155
Finally, something has gone right.

175
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,470
- Tonight is perfect.
- Yes.

176
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,669
l'm sorry, we tried to stay open
but the people in the kitchen can't go on.

177
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,270
They're not taking Luigi's death
as well as l am.

178
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,396
Please, accept our apologies.

179
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,915
Here is the bill.

180
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,351
The bill? For what?

181
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,279
Sir, l'm not interested in squabbling
with you on this night.

182
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,357
Here, are you satisfied?

183
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,353
Go back to Pittsburgh, USA.

184
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,313
Keep your money
for your cowboy boots and missiles.

185
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,475
This place is overrated!

186
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,877
l do.

187
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,793
- Diane!
- l...

188
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,354
Diane! Don't do this!

189
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,229
What the hell...?
Excuse me, Father.

190
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,153
Sam, what on earth are you doing here?

191
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,834
Why are you marrying Frasier?

192
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,278
- l love him, of course.
- No.

193
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,956
No. Look me in the eye.
Now say that.

194
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,030
l can't.

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,351
You love me. Admit it.

196
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,159
- Now, look here...
- l'm sorry, Frasier.

197
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,436
Diane and l belong together.

198
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,237
l know it's nuts,
but we both know it's true.

199
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,830
You're right.

200
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,391
l can't keep playing it safe, even
if l get hurt. l have to admit l love you.

201
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,678
l've always loved you and l always will.

202
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,430
- Frasier, will you forgive me?
- You know l will.

203
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,637
l guess l knew
you two would end up together.

204
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,509
- You're a good man, Frasier.
- l try.

205
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,033
A dear, sweet, lovely man.

206
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,071
Be happy, Diane.

207
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,114
Well, Sam, l'm all yours.

208
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,435
Come on.

209
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,673
Let's go show Europe
what romance means.

210
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,435
lt's not going to be like before.

211
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,353
l'll make you happier
than you thought possible.

212
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,193
l'll respect you and accept you,

213
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,033
and l won't complain or argue
or be jealous.

214
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,636
And l'll stop thinking
the life out of everything.

215
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,112
l'll do all l can to make sure
you enjoy life to the fullest.

216
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,953
lf that means letting you
date other women

217
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,430
while l remain faithful to you, so be it.

218
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,273
Your love is worth the price.

219
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,119
l think this is gonna work this time.

220
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,909
Sam!

221
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,074
l'm sorry. My mind was somewhere else.

222
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,792
lf we don't get some beers to this crowd,
they'll turn ugly.

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,837
Too late!

224
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,034
Does anyone know how long it takes
to get to ltaly from here?

225
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,838
OK, nobody panic!

226
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,028
You can make it from here to ltaly
in 8 hours, 37 minutes, 22 seconds.

227
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,272
- With a good tail wind.
- Seriously?

228
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,396
Unless you take the polar route.

229
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,554
Then you run into those convex currents
created by the aurora borealis.

230
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,837
You're a roaring bore-ealis.

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,594
Get hold of yourself, Sam.
You're losing it.

232
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,196
- You have a travel agent, don't you?
- Yeah. Cathy.

233
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,273
Find out of l can get
onto a plane tonight to Florence.

234
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,159
- Bingo.
- What are you doing?

235
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,189
Can't you see this is a twisted cry
for help? Sammy, l'm here for you.

236
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,717
Knock it off. l'm not saying l'm going.
l just wanna find out if l can.

237
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,556
l don't get it, Sammy. Why Diane?
Why not arsenic or strychnine?

238
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,713
Let's see if l'm following this.
Carla, you think Diane is bad for Sam.

239
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,518
Oh, boy.

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,717
This is the craziest thing
l've ever considered.

241
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,714
You think l should go through with this?

242
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,351
l think that you and Diane
are lovely, special people.

243
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,593
Alone. Separately. lndividually.

244
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,991
Together, frankly, you stink.

245
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,196
To the casual observer,

246
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,990
your running off to ltaly
would seem stupid beyond reason.

247
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,799
- l'm going.
- That's what l'd do.

248
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,869
She'll try to change you.
You can't be something you're not.

249
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,868
You're a hound. You were born a hound.
You'll always be a hound.

250
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,716
- You live for the hunt.
- People change. Hounds can change.

251
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,438
Thank you, Cathy.

252
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,275
There's a flight leaving in 45 minutes,
7 4 7, wide body,

253
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,036
Flight 893, Captain Omar Wilkins.
Good man.

254
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,556
Movie is ''Blame lt on Rio'',
edited for in-flight viewing,

255
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,632
and l recommend the chicken Diablo.

256
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,475
- Thank you.
- Roger, wilco.

257
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,152
l'm out of here.

258
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,395
Look at that pretty girl by the phone.

259
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,079
- You looked. You know why?
- You told me to.

260
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,550
l'm telling you not to go.
You're not listening to that.

261
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,236
You looked because you're Sammy.
l don't wanna lose that guy.

262
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,030
- l like him a lot.
- You're not gonna lose him. l promise.

263
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,751
Listen, l gotta do this. lt's not for me.
lt's not for Diane.

264
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,799
lt's for Frasier. Nobody deserves
to be married to that woman.

265
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,313
l'm not saying
l'm gonna marry her. l just...

266
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,433
l can't let her
make this kind of mistake.

267
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,278
Sammy, liftoff's at 0-4-0 and counting.

268
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,148
l'll call you from Florence.

269
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,911
Talk about romantic.
lf l was a woman, l'd be crying.

270
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,595
What would you do if you were a man?

271
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,317
l suppose it's possible that Diane
will marry Frasier anyway.

272
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,391
Not a chance, come on.

273
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,554
No woman would turn down a man like
Sammy who crossed the ocean for her.

274
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,840
Well, a toast to Sammy,
somewhere high over the Atlantic.

275
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,316
Or, if he's lucky, in it.

276
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,277
The operator's connecting me.

277
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,719
Even if you get your mother,
she won't be in time for the wedding.

278
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,749
- She'd have to be in the air already.
- l want to tell her we're getting married.

279
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,268
Look at that peasant woman by the tree.
Wouldn't that make a beautiful picture?

280
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,715
The essence of ltaly.

281
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,871
Give your mother my love.

282
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,552
Please, Sam, for once in your life,
have done the right thing.

283
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,837
Don't be at Cheers. Be on a plane.

284
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,073
No, as far as l know,
Paul Revere never went to Florida.

285
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,072
But...

286
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,673
Let me get it.

287
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,116
lt's Sam's private line.
The machine will pick up.

288
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,075
Hi, this is Sam Malone.

289
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,435
Frasier, l've been thinking.

290
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,478
We're so far from Florence
and we're having car trouble.

291
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,835
Fate is telling us something.

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,437
Why not just get married here
in this little town, right now?

293
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,797
- Wouldn't that be romantic?
- Diane, l love that idea.

294
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,155
- Let's do it.
- l love you.

295
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,789
Are you cold, sir?

296
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,953
No. No, l'm not.
l just had a chill, l guess.

297
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,908
- lf there's anything l can do...
- l'm fine.

298
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,432
But don't go too far away.
l think l may need some assistance.

299
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,036
