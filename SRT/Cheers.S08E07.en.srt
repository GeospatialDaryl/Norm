00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,088
Oh, brother.

3
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:09,458
These phone bills           
    are sky high.

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,210
I've got to find a new         
 long-distance carrier.

5
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:15,446
Let me see, do i go            
 with one that charges by       
 the mile or the time of day?

6
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,949
Well, why don't you 
            just use the system 
            that we all use?

7
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:20,151
What is it, sprint? M.C.I.?

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,769
No, it's, uh,      
             cheers' phone.

9
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:25,674
Really, ma?                
     That's-- hey, hold on.

10
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,525
You know, it's 12:00 in tokyo.

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,179
Is that yesterday       
        or tomorrow, ma?        
 Cliff.

12
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:33,398
What? I left a quarter.

13
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,984
So, anyway, sorry.             
 Uh, somebody was talking       
 to me here.

22
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:34,809
What is it, carly?          
    You look like               
    a large-mouth bass.

23
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,894
A very fetching            
     large-mouth bass.

24
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,164
Sammy's talking        
         to darryl mead

25
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,565
of the boston red sox.

26
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:44,352
I've been thigh-struck         
 over that guy for 5 years,

27
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:47,122
especially in '88              
 when he led the league

28
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,224
in tight-fitting pants.

29
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:53,645
Boy, to know you're     
        the best at something.  
        What an honor.

30
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,313
Go ahead, go after him. 
        Go meet him.

31
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,148
I would love       
             his autograph.     
                         Yes.

32
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,550
Maybe i can get him            
 to sign my breast.

33
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:03,054
Well, that, uh, should         
 complete the lineup card then.

34
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,122
Shh.

35
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,960
Look, for whatever reason,     
 i'm really hitting the ball    
 a ton lately.

36
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,029
Ah, well,           
            you're not dragging 
            the bat barrel,

37
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,298
and you're waiting longer  
     on the breaking pitch.

38
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,200
Wow, if you say so.

39
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,985
Pleased to meet you.

40
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,221
Maybe i ought      
             to introduce you.

41
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,558
Uh, darryl, this is    
         carla lebec.           
         She's a very big fan.

42
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:24,992
Up you go.

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,661
There you are.

44
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,231
Um, maybe i should         
     go get you a beer, huh?

45
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,702
Yeah, why don't you    
         go to germany          
         to get one, sammy.

46
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:35,653
You seem to know a lot         
 about baseball, carla,

47
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,605
you remind me of               
 my first hitting coach.

48
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,890
Bet i look cuter    
            in black underwear.

49
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,462
Yeah, but he could probably    
 spit tobacco farther.

50
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,230
Don't count on it.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,401
Listen, carla, you want        
 to call me later?

52
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,202
We can go out                  
 and have some dinner.

53
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,638
Are you kidding?   
             I'm there.

54
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:56,074
Oh, wait a minute. 
             I can't go. Damn!

55
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,109
Why not?                       
 You got to work?               
                     No.

56
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,279
Gee, i--i don't want you   
     to think any less of me,

57
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:02,730
but i'm married.

58
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:05,633
Why should that stop you?

59
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,335
Jeez, you're a pig.

60
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:09,837
Now, i really wish         
     i could go out with you.

61
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,825
[Gasping]      
     just in case.

62
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,862
I don't know       
             when a paper cut   
             felt this good.

63
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,598
I'll see you, sam.

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,883
And, uh, thanks for            
 the tips, carla.

65
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:24,752
Hope i hit                 
     a home run tonight.

66
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,421
I swear,           
             if i was single,

67
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:28,606
you'd have hit one already.

68
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,259
This is bad.

69
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,828
This is real--             
     i shouldn't have this.

70
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,797
I should not have this.

71
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,215
Rebecca.

72
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,249
(Rebecca)  
                     uh-huh.

73
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,986
This paper is my ticket        
 to eternal damnation.

74
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,603
So would you do me a favor?

75
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,773
Put it in the safe             
 and never give it to me.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,442
No matter what i say,          
 no matter how much i beg,

77
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,944
do not give me                 
 this piece of paper.

78
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:52,147
Ok.        
 Oh, let me make sure           
 i gave you the right one.

79
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,415
I told you                     
 never give me this!

80
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,519
I can't believe this.

81
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:01,256
I mean the guy with    
         the best buns          
         on the red sox

82
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,723
asked me to go out     
         with him,

83
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:03,892
and i had to say no.

84
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,660
Man, it's not fair.

85
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,146
I swear, i get all             
 the disadvantages of           
 being married,

86
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,647
and none of the perks.

87
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,466
W-- oh, wait,      
             there are perks?

88
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,753
She's just talking.        
                    Yeah.

89
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,373
Eddie's on the road    
         with the ice show      
         for months at a time.

90
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:21,926
The money he sends back        
 is a joke.

91
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:24,796
Yes, i guess the ice show      
 craze in america               
 never really recovered

92
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,764
from the loss               
    of frick and frack.

93
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,117
He's never at home             
 to help out with the family.

94
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:31,619
And all that would be fine,

95
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,489
if i could just visit him      
 for a few bed sprints

96
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:36,090
once in a while.

97
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,276
I don't even get that.         
 Come on,                       
 you're being too tough on him.

98
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,428
[Phone ringing]         
 no, i mean it, really.         
 He doesn't care

99
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,780
or pay attention.

100
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:44,882
Carla, it's for you.    
        It's some guy           
        from the ice show.

101
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,902
Case in point, sammy,          
 i know exactly                 
 what that call is.

102
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,787
Tomorrow is graduation.

103
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:52,957
It's the most important        
 day in anne marie's life.

104
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,492
Or is it serafina?

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,128
Uh, one of the older kids.

106
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,312
Anyway,

107
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,831
eddie's probably           
     having someone call

108
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,667
with some lame,                
 stupid excuse

109
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,769
why he can't show up.

110
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,874
All right,              
        what's his excuse?

111
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,545
Uh-huh.

112
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,580
Uh-huh.

113
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,850
Uh-huh.

114
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,252
Right. Well,               
     these things happen.

115
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,174
Can't go to graduation, huh?   
         No, he can't.

116
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,326
What's the excuse?  
         He's dead.

117
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,662
Huh. That old one.

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,184
What's the problem?

119
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,203
Eddie's dead.

120
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,171
It was a freak accident    
     with the ice show.

121
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,406
Happened real sudden.

122
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,292
They were cleaning the ice

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,144
with that big machine      
     after the penguin          
     salsa number.

124
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,980
One of the penguin's slipped,  
 fell in front of the machine.

125
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,016
Eddie dived

126
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,585
just in time,

127
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,087
pushed the guy out of the way,

128
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,105
and he never felt a thing.

129
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,044
Honey, i'm sorry.

130
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,346
I'm so sorry.       
         Yeah.

131
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:08,315
Oh, looks like                 
 table 5 is ready to order.

132
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,377
You know, a lot of people      
 just remember

133
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,980
eddie as a big, fat,           
 wobbling penguin

134
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,982
on the ice show,

135
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,283
but i bet before that,         
 he was quite a goalie.

136
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,719
Oh, yes, sam, i remember   
     that night against         
     the maple leaves,

137
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,904
he stopped like        
         40, 50 shots on goal.

138
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,573
I mean, counting           
     the 10 that got past him,

139
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,276
that's one night's     
         work, isn't it?

140
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,061
But you gotta              
     give the man his due.

141
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:39,730
He was one hell            
     of a penguin, too.

142
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,901
You know, i wonder         
     how many of us             
     would give up our lives

143
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,220
to save a fellow           
     human being?

144
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:48,806
Time to close up.

145
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:52,076
Oh, we can do that, carla.     
 No, no, it's my night          
 to clean and wash.

146
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,795
Carla, let me just             
 drive you home.

147
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,948
Why? There's nothing           
 i could do.                    
 I'm going to close up.

148
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,950
Phew.

149
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,485
You know along the lines   
     of what dr. Crane          
     was saying before,

150
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,954
how many of us,            
     when faced with the loss   
     of a loved one,

151
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,608
would stay and close up?   
     She is something.

152
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,594
Woody, i think         
         she's still in shock.

153
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,346
Maybe i should take        
     the initiative             
     and speak with her.

154
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,899
How many of us,         
        when faced with having  
        to talk with someone

155
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,885
who's lost a loved one,        
 would take the initiative--    
         woody!

156
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,289
Shut up.

157
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,274
There's my answer.

158
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,383
Carla, different people

159
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,319
deal with the loss     
         of a loved one         
         in different ways.

160
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:38,306
As such, your stoic behavior   
 is--is quite understandable,

161
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,708
but studies        
             in human behavior

162
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:43,244
tell us that       
             we need to grieve.

163
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,746
And until we do        
         allow ourselves that   
         emotional release,

164
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:48,983
we can never get back  
         on the course of life.

165
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,336
You see, some people   
         hold in their grief

166
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,371
for literally years    
         and years,

167
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,241
and all they accomplish    
     is to prolong              
     the grief and the agony,

168
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,042
casting a pall over

169
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,227
their own remaining 
            days on this earth.

170
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,196
Oh! Oh, mommy!

171
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:03,798
Mommy, why you?

172
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,249
Oh! Mommy.

173
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,501
[Sobbing]

174
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,030
<i>[organ music playing]</i>

175
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:35,229
so we, the friends             
 of e. Edward lebec,

176
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,865
silently, each in his own way,

177
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,784
bid him goodbye,

178
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,470
[man coughing]         
    secure in the belief

179
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,706
that he will live          
     in eternal peace.

180
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,674
I think this is 
                a nice service.

181
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:50,044
You've been to a lot           
 of them, huh, wood?

182
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,846
What do you mean, sam?

183
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:53,514
Oh, i just remember            
 the size of your family

184
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:57,351
and all the unfortunate things 
 that seem to happen to them.

185
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,387
No, no, no, sam,       
         you've got that wrong.

186
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:02,540
Very few of those people   
     were killed, just maimed.

187
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:07,327
I had an uncle         
         who lived to be 103.

188
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,730
He had both ears   
             till he was 101.

189
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,623
Carla.

190
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,826
Carla, it's good to cry.

191
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,561
It's cleansing.

192
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,662
Try.

193
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,631
(Priest)                       
 at this point of the service,

194
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,518
i would like mrs. Lebec        
 to kindly step forward.

195
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,687
[Weeping]

196
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:49,236
i-i'm sorry. I--i meant        
 his wife to step forward.

197
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,673
[Both crying]

198
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:59,380
i meant his current wife.

199
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,132
[Both crying]

200
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,287
uh-oh.

201
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:18,549
Look, lady, i don't know    
    what you're trying to pull,

202
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,234
but i am not amused.

203
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,886
Yeah, if you're trying to get  
 a laugh at a funeral,

204
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,621
you're going to have           
 to be a lot funnier than that.

205
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,360
I am gloria lebec,

206
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,178
as in eddie lebec.

207
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:32,864
Who the hell are you?

208
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:36,567
I'm carla lebec,       
         eddie's poor           
         grieving widow.

209
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,070
I'm eddie's                 
    poor grieving widow.

210
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,005
That's impossible. 
             See this?

211
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,906
Yeah? Well, see this?

212
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,909
Yeah? Well, see this?

213
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:48,495
Widows, please.

214
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:51,865
Now, perhaps we can deal       
 with this unfortunate          
 revelation later

215
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,767
and continue            
        with the memorial.

216
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,971
With all due respect,  
         father, to hell        
         with that noise.

217
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,674
Eddie's not going anywhere     
 till i get some answers.

218
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,194
Lady, you've got           
     a lot of nerve.            
             Me?

219
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,930
What about you?         
        I'm his wife!

220
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,348
I'm his wife!           
                I'm his wife!

221
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:08,715
I'm his wife!              
             I'm his wife!

222
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:11,152
Ladies, ladies,     
            let go of the head! 
            Let go of the head!

223
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,438
Now just,                  
     both of you sit down,      
     right now,

224
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:17,024
and we'll settle this       
    after the service.

225
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,812
Father.            
     Thank you, son.

226
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:25,917
Now, as we reflect             
 on the life of this

227
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,852
bewildered young man...

228
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:32,456
eddie knew exactly             
 what he was doing.

229
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:35,359
2 years ago,                   
 he came to my town             
 with the ice show.

230
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:38,446
And what town would that be,   
 desperate hag, iowa?

231
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,201
Kenosha, wisconsin.

232
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,818
That's where               
     the ice show rehearses.

233
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,737
All right,                 
     so he had a fling.

234
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,472
It wasn't a fling.

235
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,658
Pengie and i fell in love.

236
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,246
Lady, what are you looking     
 to get out of this?

237
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,331
Money? Well, forget it.

238
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,500
What do you think they         
 paid a washed-up hockey goalie

239
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,486
who bounced around from     
    team to team                
    and league to league,

240
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,323
'cause he was never            
 any good in the first place?

241
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,925
These tributes                 
 are really something,          
 aren't they?

242
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,744
I am not going to stand 
        for that kind of talk   
        about my husband.

243
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,948
I told you, he was my husband. 
 I had twins with eddie.

244
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:16,000
So what? So did i.

245
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,117
Yikes!

246
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:24,741
At least mine                  
 don't give you warts           
 when you touch 'em.

247
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,644
[All exclaiming]

248
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,929
oh, all right, lady.

249
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,548
You're cruising.

250
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,132
Go for it!

251
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,584
[Both shrieking]

252
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,773
[both screaming]

253
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,563
[all clamoring]

254
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,054
[people chattering]

255
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:56,123
hey, woody,                    
 how's that chin of yours?

256
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,291
Better.

257
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:58,926
I'm sorry i slugged you,       
 woody.

258
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:04,148
I thought you were one     
     of those ice people.

259
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,867
But i just can't get over  
     this eddie thing.

260
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:08,102
Yeah.

261
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,554
I mean, i can understand   
     going out with

262
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,390
2 babes at one time,   
         but to actually        
         be married to both,

263
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,759
that's sick.

264
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,079
Believe me, sam,

265
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:20,281
in my profession,              
 i've learned                   
 that mankind is capable

266
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:23,150
of all manner                  
 of deviant behavior.

267
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,219
Well, of course now that       
 i have a child to support,

268
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,338
i say keep it coming.

269
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,858
Hey, come on,              
     what are you doing here?

270
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,477
I had to get out   
             of the house, sam.

271
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,945
Walls closing in               
 on you, huh?

272
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,581
No. Too much broken glass  
     on the floor.

273
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,917
[Glass shattering]         
 sweetheart.

274
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,319
Oh, honey, come on.            
 Everything's going to be ok.

275
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:44,488
It's going to be fine.         
             It's not going     
             to be fine, sam,

276
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,223
it's never going   
             to be fine again.

277
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,508
Nothing in my life

        What's wrong with me?

    were in which house?

I mean, it was different   
     with nick.

             eddie was good

         somebody good loved me 
         made me feel good.

Now, if it turns out           
 that he wasn't good after all, 
 does that mean that

I bet the only reason       
    he married you

339
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,844
was because

00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,781
Nah. He only does      
         that for pictures.

425
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,899
Mine, too.

426
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,451
Hey, maybe             
         it's hereditary,

427
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:57,103
'cause eddie's nose     
        was always running.

428
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,006
Wasn't it, though?

429
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:05,078
Well, i better be going.

430
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:08,865
The kids and i have got    
     a 17-hour bus ride         
     ahead of us to kenosha.

431
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,702
What are you taking,    
        the polar route?

432
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,005
Hey, look it's been    
         a hell of a day.

433
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,958
Why don't you skip the bus     
 and spend the night            
 at my house?

434
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,961
That's nice of you, carla.

435
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,163
Well, you haven't      
         seen my house.

436
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,084
Thanks.

437
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,768
Well, actually you'd be        
 doing me a favor,

438
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,603
'cause i got to work   
         late tonight

439
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,773
and i could use    
             a babysitter.

440
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,225
Hey, cliff is leaving  
         right now.             
         He'll drive you home.

441
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,978
Yeah, i've just ordered a beer 
 there, carla. Sorry.

442
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:42,399
[Clears throat]            
     that hit the spot.

443
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:48,688
(Gloria)                       
 know what?

444
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,908
You're a pretty nice lady.

445
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,459
I can see why eddie         
    knocked you up.

446
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,930
Ditto.

447
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:00,884
Did you know that "gloria"     
 comes from the latin           
  <i>glorioski?</i>

448
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,286
It's a, uh, expression     
     of surprise,

449
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:06,289
it was, uh, made popular       
 during the depression          
 by the, uh,

450
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,725
round-eyed waif             
    little orphan annie.

451
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:12,362
You know, it's no mistake      
 that she didn't have           
 any pupils in her eyes...

452
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:20,954
carla, that was such    
        a sweet thing you did.

453
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:23,440
Yeah, well, i couldn't let     
 her sit on a bus

454
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,475
on the day of                  
 our husband's funeral.

455
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:28,728
No, no, i mean getting rid of  
 cliff a few hours early.

456
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,233
Carla, you know        
         it just dawned on me.

457
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,702
You don't have to work 
         late tonight.          
 Yeah, i know.

458
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:39,323
But now that i know            
 that eddie loved me best,

459
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,092
i just feel like i should be   
 alone for a while

460
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,028
and grieve for him         
     in my own way.

461
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:47,297
Pool room's empty, right?      
                 Yeah.

462
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:52,736
[People chattering]

463
