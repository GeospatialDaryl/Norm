00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:05,938
Hey, guys.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,406
I brought in
some leftover birthday cake

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,941
from the party.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,276
Thought you might like
to share it.

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,711
Whose birthday--
one of your kids?

7
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,480
Yeah, right.
You see a file in it?

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,788
Today happens to be
Elvis Presley's birthday.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,490
Celebrating the
birthday of a dead guy?

10
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,858
That's kind of
ghoulish, isn't it?

11
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,926
I don't know how you could
stomach something like that.

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,062
It's double mocha
chocolate fudge.

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,565
Long live the King.

14
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,902
Those of us who keep the faith
believe that on this day

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,671
he's going to make
his presence known.

16
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,506
Yeah, uh, how's
he going to do that?

17
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,740
CARLA:
Well, it could be
anything--

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,243
song on the radio,
whisper in the wind,

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,012
just something
that unmistakably says "Elvis."

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,014

Ah, good afternoon,
Miss Tortelli.

38
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,729
Oh, Hill.

39
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,865
What, are you on
an ugly break?

40
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,034
Oh, my.
Someone certainly got up

41
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,970
on the wrong side of town
this morning.

42
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,842
What's the matter, Hill,
your scalp on too tight?

43
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,381
Very funny.

44
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,483
Free this evening?

45
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,153
Just get it
through your hairy ears,

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,521
whatever happened
between us

47
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,690
was strictly
a seven-night stand.

48
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,625
Oh...

49
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,560
You're forgetting...

50
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:45,764
All right, seven nights, two
lunch breaks, and a bus ride.

51
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,735
I love slumming with you.

52
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,337
Well, just
forget it.

53
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,872
Today is Elvis' birthday,
and I'm not interested.

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,574
Get out of here.

55
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,710
Okay, but if you change
your mind,

56
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,112
you know where you can get me.

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,981
Good Lord,
do you know where to get me.

58
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,352
Woof!

59
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,789
I can't believe it.

60
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,491
What is it, Sam?

61
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,692
(clearing throat):
Oh...

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,794
Tony, my hairstylist--

63
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,264
he's making a left on Boylston
and this bus cut him off.

64
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,399
Car jumped the curb,

65
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,034
and he slammed into
this hot dog stand

66
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,535
and ended up in the
middle of the pond

67
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,070
in the public
gardens.

68
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,573
He's at the hospital now
with two broken legs.

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,109
Got to cancel my
hair appointment.

70
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,448
I hate it when stuff
like that happens to me.

71
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,017
(door opens)

72
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,651
Greetings, all.

73
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,253
I have a brief
announcement.

74
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,988
You may recall last year

75
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,224
I brought in
my dysfunctional men's group.

76
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,325
Well, unfortunately,

77
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,760
my low self-esteem group
heard about it

78
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,395
and now they think
they're not good enough.

79
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,365
So you're bringing them here?

80
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,601
Well, I'd like the group
to get used to a normal,

81
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,336
healthy, social environment.

82
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,605
So you're bringing them here?

83
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,040
Look, all I'm asking, guys,

84
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,176
is that you treat them
as if they were at home.

85
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,246
You know, they've all been
wounded and they're vulnerable,

86
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,248
and, well, the truth is,

87
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,017
you'll never find
a sadder group of people.

88
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,352
Oh, yeah?

89
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,087
How about
the Donner party?

90
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,756
Well, you know, they-they
got lost in the mountains

91
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,858
and had to watch
their limbs freeze off

92
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,293
while they ate each other.

93
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,430
Well, you caught me.

94
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,766
<i>Cannibalism is sadder
than low self-esteem.</i>

95
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,503
Carla, what's
the date?

96
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,905
Don't you know?

97
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,873
(chuckling):
Rebecca, on this date

98
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:39,144
in 1935,
Elvis Aaron Presley was born.

99
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,013
A man who was destined

100
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,215
to change the shape
of popular music.

101
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,751
A man who captured
the hearts of America.

102
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,486
A man who,
through his music...

103
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,954
Can I have my drink?

104
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,661
...taught us all
the meaning of love.

105
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,997
Listen, I have
a question for you, Tony.

106
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,633
Uh, are your arms broken
as well,

107
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,603
or is it j-just the legs?

108
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,338
Just the legs are shattered.

109
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,707
(quietly):
All right!

110
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,109
Say, all right, Tony,

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,411
maybe if I showed up there
with some scissors

112
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,180
I could lean over the bed
and y... Tony?

113
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,783
Tony, don't-don't pass out
on me, man.

114
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,884
Hello?

115
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,552
Who's this?

116
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,021
You're his nurse?

117
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,188
Ah, great.

118
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,792
Listen, honey, do you
cut hair by any chance?

119
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,594
Hello? Shoot!

120
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,864
I hate this.

121
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,201
I can hear the little hairs
scraping along my collar.

122
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,505
Can you hear that,
or is that just me?

123
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,175
Hey, Sam, why don't you
let me cut your hair?

124
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,144
(laughs)

125
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,745
(snorts)

126
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,814
That's cute, man,
that's very funny.

127
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,517
Took my mind off
my hair there
for a minute.

128
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,286
No, Sam, I'm serious.

129
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,821
I-I'm pretty good at it.

130
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,790
I cut Dr. Crane's
hair once.

131
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,726
Yes, uh, he did, and I must say
he did an excellent job.

132
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,795
No, I don't know,
Woody, I don't know.

133
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,396
Sam, look, all right,

134
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,399
let me just trim the back,
just to get it off the collar

135
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,234
so you don't have
to listen to it.

136
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,438
<i>So we don't have
to listen to it.</i>

137
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,340
SAM:
All right, just
the back, though.

138
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,041
This is what
we're gonna need:

139
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,444
sterile
tungsten steel scissors,

140
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,448
English bone comb,
36 to 39 tines,

141
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,817
and a conditioner
with a pro-vitamin

142
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,919
B-5 keratin complex.

143
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,120
Got that?

144
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,890
And this little
tool of the trade.

145
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,934
Take the bowl
off the head.

146
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,304
(laughing):
Sam, it's just a
little barber humor.

147
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,372
(chuckles)

148
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,940
Come on!

149
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,074
No, it's, like, uh...

150
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,477
All right, what do
you say to someone

151
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,379
who just had their
ears lowered?

152
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,247
Oh, darn, I blew the joke.

153
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,249
All right...

154
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,594
Step down.

155
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,730
Step down.

156
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,833
Step down.

157
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,138
Hi.

158
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,078
Wouldn't you know,
it's always the one that
talks big in the office.

159
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,883
Oh, that's right,
that's his ride. Oh.

160
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,786
Well, all right, uh,
the rest of you, uh, mingle.

161
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,187
(chuckles)

162
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,657
No, no. Boys,
what we're doing
here is huddling.

163
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,493
You do know the difference
between huddling and mingling?

164
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,995
(mumbling):
I know how to mingle.

165
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,563
I just don't want to mingle
with people I don't know.

166
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,331
Yes, that's right, Lester.
(chuckles)

167
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,833
Frasier, I didn't
quite catch that.

168
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,401
Truth be told, neither did I.

169
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,137
I haven't understood a thing
the poor sap's said in years.

170
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,806
LILITH:
Frasier,

171
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,942
I must restate my objection
to your bringing them here.

172
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,244
As I've said previously,
this is an extremely risky

173
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,280
and somewhat
frivolous experiment,

174
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,182
which could have
negative repercussions.

175
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,018
Oh, Wilma, loosen up
the bone a little!

176
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,420
This is an uncontrolled
environment

177
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,622
which could easily
get out of hand.

178
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,624
And who's this Wilma?

179
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,895
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

180
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,397
I think so.

181
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,035
Oh, is that some
of your barber humor?

182
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,070
Come on, lighten up, Sam!

183
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,584
Say, where's your
sense of humor, man?

184
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,519
Whoo!

185
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,787
Airplane ride?

186
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,455
Whoo!

187
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,957
Don't, don't do that.

188
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,959
Round trip? Whoo!

189
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,563
So...

190
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,032
you from around here?

191
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,600
Woody...

192
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,835
just get to it,
will you, please?

193
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,637
Hey, suit yourself.
Same price.

194
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,539
(shaver buzzing)

195
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,277
It's all right, Sam. Okay.

196
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,023
So, uh, you're the guys
with low self-esteem, huh?

197
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,429
Yeah, well, luckily,
I don't have that problem.

198
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,397
But then again, how could I?

199
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,066
What, with a cerebral cortex

200
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,968
that's eight percent larger
than the average human's.

201
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,605
Don't look--
you can't tell.

202
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,676
E-Excuse me, do you wear
that mailman uniform every day?

203
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,744
Yes, I do.

204
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,245
And proudly.

205
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,780
Do you live with your mother?

206
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,618
Well, uh... yeah.

207
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,820
Yeah.

208
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,356
Hey, guys, it's Mr. X.

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,761
Uh, gentlemen, let me
show you the pool room.

210
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,730
(chuckles)
Quickly.

211
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,398
(quietly):
That's the guy...

212
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,866
Come along.

213
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,268
And that must be
Mr. X's fat friend,

214
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,371
Mr. Y, at the end
of the bar!

215
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,845
(shaver buzzing)

216
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,813
(bubblegum pops)

217
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,353
(shaver turns off)

218
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,522
Oops.

219
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,024
What do you mean, "oops"?

220
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,692
What's going on back there?

221
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,127
Oh, nothing, Sam.

222
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,396
Uh, say, when you came in,

223
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,499
did you have...
gum in your hair?

224
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,301
No. Why?

225
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,770
No reason.

226
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,373
I'm just trying to pass
the time of day.

227
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,342
Aw...

228
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,745
Damn it, Woody, you got gum
in my hair, didn't you?

229
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,981
Uh, no, no. Here, here.

230
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,116
(shaver buzzing)
There.

231
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,484
Out.

232
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,554
What's it look like?

233
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,390
It's got a lot of hair in it.

234
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,893
Give me that other mirror.

235
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,096
Give me the other mirror, Woody!

236
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,664
SAM:
Woody!

237
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,486
Want to go over and say hi,
make 'em feel more at home?

238
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,356
I don't know, those
guys are wrapped up
pretty tight.

239
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,324
Who knows how loony
they could get?

240
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,759
They might be dangerous.

241
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,260
They might buy us a beer.

242
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,730
I'll do anything
to promote mental health.

243
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,503
So, uh, Wynken,
Blynken and Nod...

244
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,637
I know they're alive.

245
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,739
I can hear
them breathing.

246
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,308
Rebecca, give us
a pitcher, will you?

247
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,477
(all chatting and laughing)

248
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:59,318
So... uh, what are we
talking about here?

249
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,619
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.

250
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,388
We were kind of making
fun of somebody.

251
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,023
Oh, no. No need
to be sorry.

252
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,424
Listen, it's a
perfectly healthy sign.

253
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,658
It, it means that

254
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,826
you're interacting,

255
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,294
that you're feeling
better about yourselves.

256
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,297
So, uh, what were you
saying about this poor sap?

257
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,632
(laughter)

258
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,268
That he's a pompous fool.

259
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,705
Oh, Cliff is just
trying to fit in.

260
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,443
We weren't talking
about Cliff.

261
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,345
We were talking
about you... "egghead."

262
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,180
(laughter)

263
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,517
Me?

264
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,352
Hey, remember the time
Fras fell asleep,

265
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,821
and we, we put his hand
in that warm glass of water?

266
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,625
That's the first time
I ever saw that work.

267
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,628
Okay, we can
stop this now.

268
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,896
Hey, remember that time Carla
put the green,

269
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,732
uh, marble
in his martini glass?

270
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,966
Carla did that?

271
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,436
I broke a crown.

272
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,172
Well, how about the time he,
he leaned over his mai tai

273
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,374
and, uh, poked his eye
with the umbrella.

274
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,944
Look, there is nothing amusing
about corneal abrasion.

275
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:03,082
How about the time at
group when he leaned back

276
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,883
in his chair to make
a dramatic gesture

277
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,918
and he got stuck in
the venetian blinds.

278
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,119
NORM:
He did?!

279
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,588
Now that's funny.

280
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,989
No it's not.

281
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:15,461
Did you hear that? He
said, "No, it's snot."

282
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,129
Oh, this is not
therapy.

283
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,198
This is just
childish abuse.

284
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,133
So we put an end
to it right here.

285
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,434
This, this session
is over,

286
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,970
right now.

287
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,707
Remember, it's a fee
and a half...

288
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,377
because it's a field trip.

289
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,383
Gee, maybe we should
go apologize to him.

290
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,550
He's charging you
a fee and a half,

291
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,685
and you want to apologize?

292
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,053
Well, what should we do?

293
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,554
Pants him.

294
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,856
CLIFF:
There you go.
Yeah.

295
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,991
Yeah, let's pants him!

296
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,327
Let's go for it!
Pants him.

297
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,995
(chanting):
Pants him. Pants him.

298
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,065
Pants him. Pants him.
Pants him. Pants him...

299
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,376
Hey, Sam.

300
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,013
Hey, Sam, I hope
you're not still mad at me

301
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,515
about that haircut thing.

302
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,150
Nice hat, by the way.

303
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,520
You know, my cousin Elmore had
a hunting cap just like that.

304
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,622
Of course he decorated
it with deer antlers.

305
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,890
Big mistake.

306
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,296
Sam... why aren't
you talking to me?

307
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,198
Sam?

308
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,366
CLIFF:
Woody?

309
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,268
I think he's
ignoring you.

310
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,072
Is that true, Sam?

311
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,775
You know for a minute there
I thought I heard something.

312
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:40,946
A little tiny voice of
a nothing jerk bartender.

313
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,516
Me?

314
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,251
I think I was wrong.

315
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,254
I think it was just a tiny
little insignificant bug.

316
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,725
Well, that's very
funny Sam,

317
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:56,195
but it's not a tiny little
insignificant bug.

318
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,098
It's your assistant
bartender-- good old Woody.

319
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,671
I think I got it.

320
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,376
I can't believe it.

321
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,344
I'm being shunned.

322
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,015
Just like back in Hanover.

323
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,418
Just like with the Amish.

324
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,053
NORM:
Wood?

325
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,189
Who, uh, who shunned
you back in Hanover?

326
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,126
The Amish. Weren't you here
for this part?

327
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,164
Please, miss,
can I just have my beer?

328
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:36,201
All right. I'm gonna
give you one last chance,
and this is a gimme.

329
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,706
What was the year of Elvis'
big comeback special?

330
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,341
'72.

331
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,943
You're pathetic.

332
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,745
Hey, I paid for that beer.

333
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,981
Well, then I guess you
just should have studied, huh?

334
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,851
I hope we weren't
too hard on Fras.

335
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,287
Well, his being ridiculed
in here is one thing,

336
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,923
but out in public, that's
got to be humiliating.

337
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,158
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.

338
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,759
You know,
when I was a kid,

339
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,728
I was the first one
in my class to...

340
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,431
you know, develop breasts.

341
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,767
They teased me the whole year.

342
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,336
Oh, yeah, me, too.

343
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,643
Yeah, I took my fair share
of ribbing back in Hanover.

344
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:18,711
Yeah?

345
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,146
"Little Einstein"
they called me.

346
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,918
"Mr. Smarty Pants."

347
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,753
"Brainiac."

348
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,456
Yep. I've heard 'em all.

349
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,891
Before I die, I got
to see that town.

350
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,999
So what about you, Cliff?

351
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,700
Well, sorry
I can't help you.

352
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,901
Happy childhood.

353
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,837
Well-adjusted, well-liked.

354
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,171
Class valedictorian.

355
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,940
I'd show you
my yearbook,

356
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,708
but Ma apparently thought

357
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,477
some of the inscriptions
were off-color.

358
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,781
So she made me eat it.

359
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,151
Nope. No problems here.

360
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,389
Hey, Fras.

361
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,024
Don't "Hey Fras" me.

362
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,759
After the way you people
behaved today,

363
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,861
you're lucky I am even
speaking to you.

364
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,363
How dare you treat me like that
in front of my patients!

365
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,800
I have been your friend,
your confidante,

366
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,971
your unpaid therapist
for years.

367
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,773
And how do you show
your gratitude?

368
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,341
By humiliating me,
by making me a...

369
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,876
a laughingstock.

370
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,912
Come on, Fras, those guys
were scared stiff of you.

371
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,081
That's why they weren't
getting anywhere.

372
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,817
We were just trying to bring
you down a peg, you know?

373
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,119
Yeah, come on, Fras,
you've got to admit, uh,

374
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,488
sometimes you get up
on that high horse of yours.

375
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,991
High horse?!
Well, I never.

376
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,530
Oh, God,
Lilith was right.

377
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,764
Bringing those
patients here

378
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,000
was the worst thing I've
ever done in my life.

379
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,637
This entire affair has been
an unmitigated disaster.

380
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,305
Hey look, there's Dr. Crane.

381
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,506
Dr. Crane.

382
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,742
We figured out what you
were doing today,

383
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,444
and thanks.

384
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,212
I beg your pardon?

385
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,313
Well, you were
letting us

386
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,115
do all that stuff
to you just so we

387
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,216
could feel better
about ourselves.

388
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,684
What a guy.

389
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,219
You know, you've really
got to care

390
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,487
to go that far.

391
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,890
How about that.

392
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,293
<i>They have
figured it out.</i>

393
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,395
(chuckles)

394
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,330
This is the best
group we ever had.

395
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,531
(laughing):
Yeah, well...

396
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,533
(mumbling):
...genius.
Oh, well,

397
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,634
I wouldn't really
say "genius," Lester.

398
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,902
That is what you said, isn't it?

399
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,473
Gentlemen, good night.

400
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,008
Good night.
Thank you,
Dr. Crane.

401
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,077
You've all made wonderful
progress today.

402
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,014
Thank you,
Dr. Crane.
Thank you very much.

403
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,749
You know, maybe in
a hundred years,

404
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,084
they'll be able to
walk through a mall.

405
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,486
FRASIER:
Bye.

406
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,523
So, you all caught
a little glimpse

407
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,226
into the life of
Frasier Crane...

408
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,661
M.D., PhD.

409
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,631
Try not to think of
me any differently

410
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,434
now that you've
witnessed my unique gift.

411
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,836
You see, although I wasn't
completely aware of it,

412
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,606
I intuited
what those men needed

413
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,741
and I gave it to them,
freely and of myself...

414
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,911
for I am a healer.

415
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,681
That is what I do.

416
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,551
And we
are pantsers.

417
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,720
<i>That is
what we do.</i>

418
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,221
Oh, no.

419
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,222
No, fellas, not again.

420
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,425
No, no, these
are new pants!

421
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,011
Sam, I've really
enjoyed the way

422
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,082
you've been pretending
I'm a bug and everything.

423
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,651
But I'm not a
bug; I'm Woody.

424
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,496
Sam, where I come from,
we have a saying,

425
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,131
"An eye for an eye."

426
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,200
The point being,
of course,

427
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,634
you're supposed
to shave my head,

428
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,203
not shave out my eye.

429
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,006
(buzzing)

430
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,507
Oh, man.

431
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,842
This is stupid.
(buzzing stops)

432
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,276
I don't want
to cut your hair.

433
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,311
You don't?

434
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,946
No.

435
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,148
So you forgive me?

436
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,083
Yeah, let's just just forget
about the whole thing,

437
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,718
all right?

438
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:23,022
That... that is
real noble, Sam.

439
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,258
I mean, here I wrecked
your hair,

440
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,293
your... your beautiful,
beautiful hair,

441
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,163
the one thing you care most
about in the whole world,

442
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,065
and yet, you're willing
to forgive me.

443
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,600
I mean, you know,

444
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,368
every time you look
in the mirror,

445
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,437
you're gonna be reminded
of what I did to you,

446
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,273
and yet, you say
it's okay.

447
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,375
I have never
liked you more

448
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,178
than I do
right now, Sam...

449
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,480
ridiculous haircut
and all.

450
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,919
Woody, come in the
office with me,

451
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,354
just for a second.

452
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,022
Sure, why?

453
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,323
No reason.

454
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,160
(buzzing)

455
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,963
Carla, it's almost
midnight-- any sign?

456
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,465
(sighs)

457
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,734
Not one
blue suede shoe.

458
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:12,371
I guess Elvis
has disappointed me again.

459
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,307
Well, I'm sure the King
had a lot of other people

460
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,643
to visit around the world.

461
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,981
Yeah, well, he isn't
showing up here

462
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,316
or anywhere else tonight.

463
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,551
(blowing)

464
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,687
Uh, I have flowers
for a Miss Tortelli.

465
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,856
That's me.

466
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,990
Here you go.

467
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,660
Oh. Thanks.

468
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,198
"Carla,

469
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,500
"I wonder if you're
lonesome tonight.

470
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,534
The King."

471
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,069
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

472
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,871
Oh!

473
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,206
I knew it.

474
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,941
I knew... I knew
he'd come through.

475
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,409
I knew he wouldn't let me down.

476
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,578
But just a minute ago, you know,
you started to doubt that...

477
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,480
I did not doubt.
I never doubted.

478
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm going home, Becs.

479
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,785
I'm going home.
I'm gonna stay up all night.

480
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,654
I'm gonna listen to every record
Elvis ever made,

481
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,356
even "In the Ghetto."

482
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,229
Uh, Miss Howe, did Miss Tortelli
get the flowers?

483
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,497
Yes, she did.

484
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,898
In fact, she just
ran up the stairs.
Ah.

485
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,566
Did you send those?

486
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,101
Yes, I did,

487
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,470
but those were just
for starters.

488
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,207
This will really push her
over the edge.

489
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,353
(buzzing)

490
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,854
(door opening)

491
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,657
Woody, what was that buzzing?

492
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,293
Sam, with the razor.

493
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,996
Well, your hair
looks the same.

494
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:46,365
It's the only hair I have left.
