1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,555
FAlRY TALES CAN COME TRUE

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,872
''And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,750
''And the lamplight o'er him streaming
throws his shadow on the floor

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,277
''And my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,399
''Shall be lifted...never more!''

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,950
- Doc, you tell great stories.
- That was Poe.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,475
Don't be modest. lt was great.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,075
Who's next to chill us
with a scary story?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,435
l think l have a chilling tale.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,194
Yeah, but it's cute when you wiggle it.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,795
l got the greatest ghost story ever told.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,794
Casper got caught
in this huge laundry basket...

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,270
Don't finish it.
Some of us want to sleep tonight.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,877
You're right, Carla.
lt's best that l live with it myself.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,349
My God, what a horrible sight.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,672
Speaking of horrible sights, Coach,
take a look at...this!

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,756
Two vodka rocks with a twist.

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,959
Didn't l tell you that
Halloween at Cheers would be fun?

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,714
Yes, but l won't hold it against you.

20
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,633
l got those two tickets
for the Boston Pops.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,031
- Wonderful.
- Are you going to the Boston Pops?

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,192
- l'm jealous.
- You sound like a fan, Sam.

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,990
The Boston Pops
was the one cultural event

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,355
that Sam genuinely liked.

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,116
Yeah. l especially liked
the 1 8 somethingth overture.

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,353
- 1 81 2. - You really know your stuff.
Yeah.

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,398
Till Diane dragged me to that concert,

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,633
l never realised just how many
years of practice and dedication

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,950
it takes to become a musician.

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,591
- Anyone in particular impress you?
- Yeah, the guy on the cannons.

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,118
He's incredible. You know, l actually
thought about taking it up myself,

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,831
but l think it's one of those things
you have to start when you're young.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,676
- They say to be truly great, you do.
- That's what l thought.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,879
Sometimes l think Sam is pretending to
be less intelligent than he really is.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,832
But how intelligent would someone have
to be to pretend to be that dumb?

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,078
- l'm not even sure l could pull it off.
- Yes, you could.

37
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,519
l'm sorry, Carla, if we offended you
with our public display of affection.

38
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,832
But try to understand, Frasier Crane
has the same effect on me

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,757
that cheap chianti and dice hanging
from a rear view mirror have on you.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,956
You got it bad.

41
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,317
Hello, everyone.
And a happy All Hallows' Eve.

42
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,317
- Guess who l am.
- Cliff Clavin.

43
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,995
No, Coach, let me give you a hint.

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,913
l went to Florida
to find the fountain of youth.

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,752
Cliff Clavin.

46
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,670
Coach, l'm Ponce de Le贸n.

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,355
- l think your ears are too big.
- For Ponce de Le贸n?

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,990
- No, for you, Cliffie.
- l don't know, Coach.

49
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,355
l'm very proud of my big ears.

50
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,469
A lot of women consider them
erogenous zones during heavy petting.

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,837
Are you kidding?
You never had a date in your life.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,356
Because he's never had the guts
to ask a girl out.

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,715
lt's got nothing to do with guts.

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,317
lt's just that the women you find in
the northeastern seaboard bore me.

55
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,712
l prefer southern belles.
The kind of women you find in Florida.

56
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,758
He's going to go on about Florida again.

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,230
When l was down there,
l was covered with women.

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,758
- Sure they weren't mosquitoes?
- Thank you, Bob Hopeless.

59
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,356
l'll just go in the back
and scope out the dollies.

60
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,069
- Why don't you guys lighten up on Cliff?
- Sorry, Sam.

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,277
But you've got to admit,
it's a little bit weird.

62
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,876
He's never been married.
l've never seen him with a woman.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,316
Norm, he's your best friend.
ls he gay or what?

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,235
l can't believe what l'm hearing! You
can't tell a gay guy by his appearance.

65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,949
We had an outfielder on the Red Sox,
Duke Roberts.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,793
He never got married or went with girls.

67
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,829
He even wore fancy ltalian shoes and
he lived with a guy who was a florist.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,956
And Duke wasn't gay.

69
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,190
Yes, he was, Coach.

70
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,712
He was?
Do you think he'd like to meet Cliffie?

71
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,230
Come on, guys. Cliff is not gay, all right?

72
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,155
He's just shy around women to the point
of being a blithering idiot.

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,757
Diane, that was a colleague
on the phone. He's taken ill.

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,833
He wants me to take his place
tomorrow at a seminar

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,675
at the University of Chicago.
l've got to go home and pack.

76
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,469
- We won't be able to go to the concert.
- You can still go.

77
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,713
Listen, take along a friend.
Sam indicated some interest.

78
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,716
Sam?

79
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,759
l think l could find more stimulating
company for the concert.

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,754
l wouldn't have to look farther
than the nearest Petri dish.

81
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,517
Once again, l am startled by how far you
are above petty emotion like jealousy.

82
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,198
l just figured it was time Sam learned
to appreciate instruments without fuses.

83
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,869
- Goodbye, my tiny Alice.
- Goodbye, my mad Mad Hatter.

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,113
There are many theories why the Florida
orange is superior to the Californian.

85
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,353
l think it's the trace mineral
element in the Floridian water.

86
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,675
Due to the frequency of the typhoons
and the nitrogen-rich alligator guano.

87
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,312
- Furthermore, there's three...
- l just remembered l left my oven on.

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,874
lf l hurry home, l can stick my head in it.

89
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,838
Florida oranges are delicious.

90
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,916
- What?
- Nothing.

91
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,157
Have you been to Florida?

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,631
No, but it's always been
a crazy dream of mine to go.

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,590
l read that they have the world's largest
pair of alligator shoes there.

94
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,879
That's right. ln Orlando.
l even sat in one of them.

95
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,519
- What's your name?
- Tinker Bell. What's yours?

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,911
Me? l guess it's Ponce de Le贸n.

97
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,758
The guy that discovered Florida.

98
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,718
Would you marry me
and bear my children?

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,116
Would you like to go in the back
and maybe play some pool?

100
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,273
Or as they say in Tallahassee,
shoot some pocket billiards?

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,230
- l'd love to, Mr Le贸n.
- Please, call me Ponce.

102
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,078
lt looks like you're out to conquer
new territories, Ponce.

103
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,755
Holy God.

104
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,469
Did anyone ever tell you
you dance divinely, Ponce?

105
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,995
Someone mentioned it to me.

106
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,799
Was that Cortez or Pizarro?

107
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,873
l'm ready to go.
Would you hand me my purse?

108
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,996
l'll put a new tune on the jukebox.

109
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,712
l'm not using a pair of tickets
tomorrow for the Boston Pops.

110
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,474
You can have them if you're interested.

111
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,316
- No, thank you.
- You'll enjoy it!

112
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,917
The programme is an evening
filled with fireworks and laser beams,

113
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,631
occasionally interrupted
with the music of Gershwin.

114
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,316
l just can't think of who l'd take.

115
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,349
Most of the women l date
don't like music they can't dance to.

116
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,036
Most of the women you date don't like
music they can't shed clothing to.

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,952
- How come you don't want to go?
- l do.

118
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,353
But Frasier's out of town and l can't think
of anyone l'd like to go with.

119
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,553
l guess Frasier would feel
uncomfortable if you and l went.

120
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,319
- No, actually he suggested it.
- So, you'd be uncomfortable?

121
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,996
Not at all.

122
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,233
While you still harbour
tortured longings for me,

123
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,520
the emotions are unreciprocated.
l don't see why we shouldn't go together.

124
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,038
- Then it's a date.
- No, not a date. l mean not a date date.

125
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,156
Well, it's a...

126
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,959
What would you call
an evening with a woman

127
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,591
when you have absolutely no hope
of physical involvement whatsoever?

128
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,751
A first.

129
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,590
l guess it's time for me to be heading
back to Never Never Land.

130
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,070
- Let me walk you back to your car?
- No, that's OK!

131
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,356
lt's right outside here.

132
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,031
But l just want to know when we're going
to see each other again.

133
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,919
We haven't seen each other at all yet.

134
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,878
l know!

135
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,433
Let's meet tomorrow night on this very
spot as ourselves at eight o'clock.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,991
Don't you be a minute late.

137
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,916
- Nice enough young person, Sam?
- Way to go, Cliffie!

138
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,230
What do you mean?

139
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,632
lf l didn't know you, l'd say that
you were pretty smooth tonight.

140
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,514
Sam, l think l resent that a little bit.
Well, that's OK.

141
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,355
You just think you know me
a lot better than you really do.

142
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,637
Tonight wasn't really
all that unusual for me.

143
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,554
- Come on, Cliff.
- No, really, it was commonplace.

144
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,757
- What?
- OK, three, two, one...

145
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,354
Hooray! l got a date!

146
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,596
Thank you, Sam.

147
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,151
Here we are.

148
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,110
Yeah, thank you for the ride home
and thank you for the concert.

149
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,874
That Gershwin's a genius.

150
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,230
The mark of a great composer

151
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,279
is when the audience leaves
humming your fireworks.

152
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,557
- l had a great time.
- Me, too.

153
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,836
l've not had such a good time since...

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,197
l know when you stopped
having good times, Diane.

155
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,353
lt goes without saying. l would have had
a better time if l had gone with Frasier.

156
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,476
Me, too.

157
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,790
Thanks for a lovely evening.

158
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,672
How did you like our first outing with no
promise or threat of sexual encounter?

159
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,673
You're not out that door yet.

160
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,469
Good evening, everybody.

161
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,753
- Can l have a beer, please, Coach?
- This one's on me, Coach.

162
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,399
- Thank you, Norm.
- Cliffie...

163
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,636
Well?

164
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,996
Well, what?

165
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,430
Last l saw,
you were dancing together.

166
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,559
- Yeah, so?
- So...you know?

167
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,359
No, Norm, l don't know.

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,358
He wants to know if you boinked her,
you dink.

169
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,791
Good God, Norm!

170
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,913
Psychologists believe that one night
of meaningless pleasure

171
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,389
can get in the way of commitment?

172
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,677
- ls that true, Sam?
- l rely on it.

173
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,432
She's meeting me here tonight
at eight o'clock.

174
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,193
Eight o'clock. l don't believe this.

175
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,239
You're meeting in 1 5 minutes.
l don't believe how calm you are.

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,428
Don't tell me that you subscribe to that
myth about my discomfiture with women.

177
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,273
l was here
when a woman asked you the time.

178
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,876
You swallowed
the lower half of your face.

179
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,873
You know nothing about body language.

180
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,032
That gesture is replete
with erotic message.

181
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,873
- To a baboon.
- All right.

182
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,316
l admit that in the past
l've been shy around women,

183
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,789
but l've been thinking about it

184
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,431
and l don't think there's been
any real reason for my insecurity.

185
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,674
As a matter of fact, watch this.
Sammy, lighter.

186
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,756
May l?

187
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,390
Thank you.

188
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,630
You're very wel...

189
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,429
l mean, you're welcome. You're...

190
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,072
You're very extremely...

191
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,276
You're...

192
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,469
l think he's too damn smooth
for his own good.

193
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,748
l'm such a wimp! l'm such a wuss.
l'm such a weenie! God, am l a dink!

194
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,754
l know you're nervous,
but this one's different.

195
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,356
- You danced with her.
- l didn't dance with her.

196
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,034
- Ponce de Le贸n did.
- You did.

197
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,430
l was just playing a role.

198
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,277
- Tonight l'm me, a tongue-tied yutz.
- l want you to listen to me for a minute.

199
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,911
There's been a lot of talk about you.
The one always defending you is me.

200
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,437
That's what best friends are for.
But it's almost eight o'clock.

201
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,593
The one woman weird enough for you
to have a shot at may be outside.

202
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,832
You blow this,
l don't even want to look at you.

203
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,152
Stop it, will you, Norm? Knock it off.

204
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,469
OK, l'll go out there.

205
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,669
Thanks. l love you, big guy!

206
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,753
Give her a try first. lf it doesn't work out,
we can talk.

207
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,469
lf she comes downstairs now
and sees you standing there,

208
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,838
she'll know you've been there for six
hours. That looks desperate.

209
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,956
So?

210
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,109
That's the way it is, isn't it?
This is what love comes to.

211
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,748
l want to remember this, Sammy.

212
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,480
Somebody take my picture.

213
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,279
Come on, Cliff. lt's on me.

214
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,908
- Sit down.
- l guess you're right.

215
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,878
No more illusions
about happiness for me.

216
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,952
l'm going to drink myself into oblivion.

217
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,148
No, you're not.
You'll just have two problems that way.

218
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,630
Why did she stand me up? That does it.

219
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,315
Now l'll let my grooming
and appearance go to hell.

220
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,756
And you think
the results will be noticeable?

221
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,550
Thank you, Carla.
l want abuse piled on me tonight.

222
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,315
Maybe l'll get it through
my thick head that l'm a loser.

223
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,994
You know what
my school nickname was?

224
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,755
- No, you never told us.
- l didn't have one, Coach.

225
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,917
l tried to get one started,
made it up myself.

226
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,350
Courteous Cliff.

227
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,033
- Couldn't you have done better?
- l didn't want to arouse suspicion.

228
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,195
There's a tribe of men
in the Middle East called the Essenites.

229
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,828
They're celibate
and live without women.

230
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,436
Rumour has it that they are
the happiest men in the world.

231
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,797
Tomorrow l'm going
to send for their brochure.

232
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,117
Hello, Cheers.
No, there's no Ponce de Le贸n here.

233
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,789
We don't have Prince Albert in the can.

234
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,476
Coach. l think that might be for me.

235
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,239
Hello? Yeah.

236
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,436
Really? No, l understand.

237
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,114
Yeah, l understand.

238
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,549
OK. All right. Bye.

239
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,436
lsn't that something?

240
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,637
She was afraid to meet me
without her mask on.

241
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,589
l actually made a woman nervous.

242
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,590
That's incredible, isn't it?

243
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,149
Are you two going get together?

244
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,633
Yeah. She's at a pay phone across the
street. She said she's coming right over.

245
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,358
- Cliffie, yeah?
- Let's not stand here.

246
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,954
- We'll be up here.
- Come here.

247
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,512
- Thank you.
- We don't want to have to eavesdrop.

248
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,513
So keep your stupid remarks loud.

249
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,229
- Hello.
- Hi.

250
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,633
l'm Club Clifford.

251
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,275
l'm Cliff Clavin.

252
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,430
l'm Hario Share.

253
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,789
Sharon Hair...

254
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,838
l mean l'm Sharon O'Hare.

255
