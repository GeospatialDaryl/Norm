 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,800
            It's amazing        
            what they're making 

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,400
            for kids nowadays.  
What?                           

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
    Here's an ad for a toy      
    where you make a monster,   

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,300
                then drop him   
                in a vat of acid

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,100
            and boil the skin   
            off his bones.      

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,900
Oh, boy, Norm.                  
When we were kids,              

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,100
we had real toys                
to play with. Remember?         

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,500
                Oh, you're      
                damn straight.  

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,100
    You know, I was up          
in my attic the other day.      

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
Yeah?                           
Found my old Lionel train set.  

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
    Oh, now there is a toy.     
                        Yeah.   

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
  Remember the hours you spent  
sticking those tracks together? 

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Getting the little houses       
            just so,            

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,800
     and making sure those      
tunnels were all straight.      

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,000
 Yeah. Smelling the electricity 
burn up that transformer.       

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,900
Hey, hey.

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,100
          one of those          
      electric cattle cars

 where the cows come vibrating  
        down the chute?         

21
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,000
    I can move 40 head          
      in ten minutes, pal.      

22

         I could, too.          

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
        I got to get rid        
     of that thing though.      

25
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,000
 It's taking up lots of space.  
    I want to sell it.          

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,300
     Yeah, yeah. You'd get      
a good price for it, I bet you. 

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
 Yeah. It's a collector's item.

    knows your name

Well, maybe you're right.

a sure-fire way

yourself calm.

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
                That's great.   
                Really nice.    

370
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,800
  Oh, God!                      

371
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
          What is it?           

372
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
             A car.             

373
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,200
  It's Sheridan; we're doomed.

                          Uh... 

376
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,300
          Woody! You found him! 
                             Ah.

377
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,900
         Oh, God, I don't know  
        who to kiss first!      

378
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,400
Well, <i>I</i> just had                
a breath mint.                  

379
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
                Buster!         

380
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
            Hey, man, way to go.

381
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
Where'd you find him?           

382
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,300
Oh, at an auto wrecking yard.   

383
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,900
      What were you doing there?

384
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,800
      Just browsing.            

385
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,700
      Oh, Buster, Buster,       
        good old Buster.        

386
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,500
Oh, no, that's not Buster,      
         that's Satan.          

387
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
              What?             
SAM:                            
Who?                            

388
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,300
    I was brushing the snow     
      off of the hubcaps,       

389
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
 and I saw Satan here chewing   
 through a tire, and I thought  

390
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
  you know, he looks just like  
    that picture of Buster.     

391
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,600
So I borrowed him, in case      
  we don't find the other dog.  

392
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,500
                 Woody, take him
                 to the kitchen.

393
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,900
I only hope we can fool Sheridan
      with this flea bag.       

394
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,800
            He's no flea bag,   
            Miss Howe.          

395
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,500
He's a trained attack dog.      

396
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,600
      Come on, sweetheart.      

397
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,400
         ( <i>phone rings</i> )        
              An attack dog?    

398
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
    He brings an attack dog     
        into this house?        

399
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
      Come on, his heart's      
      in the right place.       

400
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,500
        Hello?                  

401
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,900
Oh, God, you found him?         

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,700
              Hm?               

403
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Oh, that's wonderful.           

404
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
Yeah. Give me your address.     

405
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,900
    Uh-huh.                     

406
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,100
Okay, I'll come                 
and get him right now.          

407
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,800
A neighbor at the end           
of the road found him.          

408
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
Here's the address.             
You go get him.                 

409
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm on my way.                  
              Woody?            

410
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
 Bring Satan out here, please.  

411
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Woody, we found Buster.         

412
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,800
    You can take Satan back     
        to the junkyard.        

413
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,300
    But, Miss Howe, he hasn't   
        finished his snack yet. 

414
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
    I gave him something        
    out of the refrigerator.    

415
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,300
    Well, actually, he opened   
    the door and took it, but   
    I got out of the way.       

416
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
        Woody, whatever.        
  J-Just take him out of here.  

417
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,700
Go, go, hurry.                  

418
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,400
                Hurry, hurry,   
                hurry.          

419
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,700
Sheridan's here.                
He just drove up.               

420
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,900
      Woody, cancel that. Sam...
    Yeah?                       

421
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,300
        Uh, y-you go around the 
        back way and get Buster.

422
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,800
All right?                      
Woody, you take Satan           

423
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,900
into the kitchen                
and get him some kibble.        

424
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,400
We hope that Sam gets back      
in time with Buster, so         
we don't have to use him,       

425
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,400
but if he doesn't get back      
in time with Buster,            

426
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,400
then we have to convince        
Sheridan that Satan is Buster,  

427
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,600
until Sam gets back             
and we can switch               
Buster for Satan.               

428
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,900
 <i>Or</i> I could just put            
steak sauce on my throat        
and let Satan chow down.        

429
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,700
  Uh, I understand everything   
     perfectly, Miss Howe.      

430
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,600
         Come on, Sam,          
     let's get your kibble.     

431
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,700
            ( <i>both laughing</i> )   

432
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,900
 I was just kidding, Miss Howe. 

433
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,400
  I'm back.                     

434
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Where's my big boy?             

435
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
Where's my Buster?              

436
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,800
What, no hello?                 
No description of the trip?     

437
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,100
No slides?                      
        I finished early so I   
        caught a late flight.

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
                ( <i>whistles</i> ):   
                Here, boy!      

439
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
             Where are you, boy?
             Here, Buster!      

440
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
He is, um...                    

441
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,100
  He's sleeping in the kitchen. 
That's right.                   

442
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,300
      Miss Howe, who's this man?

443
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,800
This man?                       

444
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,100
He's Woody.                     

445
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,800
          He's my boyfriend.    

446
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,100
                 Wow, Miss Howe.

447
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,000
    Your boyfriend calls you    
        Miss Howe?              

448
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,700
I was his teacher.              

449
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,500
I got real lonely,              

450
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
a-and I thought I'd call        
him over here for company.      

451
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
I hope you don't mind.          

452
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
    No, of course not.          

453
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,000
  Now, listen, I'm very tired.  

454
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,500
I just want to say hi to my dog 
      and then go to bed.       

455
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,200
So if you don't mind.           

456
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,700
        You want us to leave?   

457
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,000
He wants us to leave, Woody.    

458
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,300
             Great! How about a 
             burger and a movie?

459
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,200
             Then we can go     
             someplace and park.

460
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,900
          Later!                

461
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,600
              First, I'd like   
              to stand here and 
              have a little chat

462
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,800
            with Mr. Sheridan   
                 about his trip.
            Not now.            

463
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
     I want to see Buster.      

464
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,300
No, Mr. Sheridan!               
          Yes, Miss Howe.       
 Come on, Buster, let's wrestle!

465
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,800
                 Woody, we can't
                let him do this.
Well, don't worry, Miss Howe.   

466
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,800
He won't attack unless he hears 
the command word, "Cochise."    

467
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,600
            Cochise? Well, he's 
        never gonna say <i>that.</i>   

468
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,600
Or unless he provokes him.      

469
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,700
      ( <i>vicious growling</i> )      

470
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
        SHERIDAN:               
      Take that, big boy.       

471
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,000
      I got your tail now,      
        I got your tail!        

472
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,400
Hey, it worked--                
he thinks that's his dog.       

473
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,900
        Yeah, right. If he      
        lives, we fooled him.   

474
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,700
      Sammy to the rescue!      

475
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,200
              Sam, get that mutt
              out of here!      

476
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
            What?               
     Sheridan's in the kitchen  
             with Satan!        

477
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,700
This is no time                 
for folk singing.               

478
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, oh, oh! Well...             
what are we gonna do?           

479
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,400
    All right, go out the front,
    sneak around the back.      

480
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,900
      I'll try to divert        
      Sheridan's attention      
      while you make the switch.

481
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
             But remember, they 
             look exactly alike.

482
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,900
     All right, all right.      

483
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
Come on, boy,                   
come on.                        

484
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,900
     Boy, Buster's frisky.      
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

485
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,000
 I was playing "get my thumb,"
