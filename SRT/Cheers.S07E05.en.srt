00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Woody, I have a lot

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
of work to do here,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,800
so please make sure       
      I'm not disturbed.

Yes, ma'am.

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,100
Yes?

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,100
Miss Howe?

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,500
You want me                     
to hold business                
and personal calls?

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,700
Yes.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,500
You got it.

Miss Howe?

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,200
Uh, what if it's an emergency,

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,900
or something          
      only you can handle?

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Woody, I'm turning the bar      
          over to you.

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,500
I have complete confidence.

Miss Howe?

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,400
I want you to know

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,300
how much I appreciate      
     your confidence in me.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,600

Woody, I am trying

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,100
to get some work done here,   
 and you are driving me crazy!

29

Now, get out of here,

I'm sorry, Miss Howe.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,700
¶ Sometimes you want to go

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,100
¶ Where everybody           
    knows your name ¶

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,400
¶ And they're always glad       
        you came ¶

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
¶ You want to be        
      where you can see ¶

¶ Our troubles

¶ You want to go where     
  everybody knows your name. ¶

Hey, Fras,                      
new briefcase?

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
No. It's my new         
  portable cellular telephone,

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
the answer to every busy    
      therapist's prayers.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,500
You see, with this,
             I can instantly    
             get in touch

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,600
with patients   
                in crisis.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,900
Who knows how many
              lives it may save?

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Looks cool, too?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Doesn't it?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,200
Yeah.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,300
( <i>phone rings</i> )

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Oh, excuse me.

49
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,400
Oh, geez.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,700
I seem to have forgotten
        the combination.

51
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,100
( <i>phone rings</i> )

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,300
I was certain I programmed      
    Lilith's birthday

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,000
so I'd remember it.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
Oh, no?

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
My birthday.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,700
( <i>ringing continues</i> )

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Frasier, that's getting         
a little annoying.

58
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,300
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,700
Of course.

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,300
Freud's birthday.

61
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,800
Hello. Cheers.

( <i>phone rings</i> )

63
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
Two drafts, Sam.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,500
Coming right up.

65
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,900
Shouldn't you be on your way  
        to the airport?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No. Eddie called
                from Louisville.

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,200
He said the         
            performer's plane

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,300
was gonna be    
                a little late

69
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,200
so he'd meet
                    me here.

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Oh, you must be getting         
pretty excited, huh?

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,600
Yeah. I thought
                 that ice show

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
would never get
                 back to Boston.

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,300
Yeah, it has been tough.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,300
He misses me.               
Yeah.

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
You know? Kids miss him.

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,100
Not to mention                  
that I have moved

77
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,500
into my sexual peak.

78
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,300
You've been there           
    since you were 12.

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,700
When you find a place you like, 
why leave it?

82
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,400
Sorry, sorry.

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Oh, wait.

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Jung's address.

85
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Finally.

86
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
Hello.

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,100
No, there is no Itzhak here.

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,100
Woody, here are your tickets.

89
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,600
Tickets?    
            Woody gets tickets?

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,900
Company season tickets.

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,700
Patriots-Dolphins tonight.

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,300
Two on the 40-yard line.

93
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Ooh-ooh-oh-wee!

94
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
Oh. You know,          
    thanks, Miss Howe.

95
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,600
You know, you are           
 the greatest boss I ever had.

96
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,900
( <i>clears throat</i> )

97
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
I mean...

98
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,700
you're the prettiest boss       
          I ever had.

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,300
( <i>clears throat</i> )

100
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,900
I mean, thanks.

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,300
So, uh,

102
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,900
Woodster, what time
             we leaving, bud?

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Well, Mr. Peterson,       
      you'd be interested

104
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,700
in going to something like this?

105
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,500
Yeah.       
Dit-dit-dit-dit...

106
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Fair is fair.

107
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,100
What?           
    Now, Woody...

108
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,500
didn't I, uh,   
                invite you

109
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,800
to a very special occasion      
just last week?

110
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,700
That's right, Mr. Clavin.

111
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,000
I sure did enjoy            
    that garage sale.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Excuse me, but why do I seem

113
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,600
to have been          
    automatically excluded?

114
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
You have to go    
              home to your wife.

115
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,700
What about your wife?

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,900
You can't be this dense
         with your patients.

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Hey, Carla, I'm back.

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
Hey.                    
                    Hey.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,700
Hey, everybody.

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,900
N-n-not-not here.

121
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,700
Everybody's watching.

122
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Excuse me.              
     I-I'll be right back.

123
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
I just got              
    to show Eddie something.

124
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,900
( <i>clears throat</i> )

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh, Eddie.

126
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700

( <i>door rattling</i> )

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Ah, gee, it's   
                good to be home.

129
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,900
Give me a beer,                 
Sam... here.

130
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,600
Thanks, Sam.

131
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.   
( <i>gasps</i> )

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,600
A charm bracelet                
from Cincinnati!

133
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah. There's          
      a little beer stein,

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
little bowl   
                  of sauerkraut,

135
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
and Pete Rose's head.

136
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,300
Ooh, Carla, can I borrow it?

137
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,300
Fat chance.

138
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,400
This better not                 
turn my wrist green.

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
No.

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,300
Hey.

141
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,400
Hey, buddy.

142
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
How's the show doing?

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh, terrific.

144
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,700
We signed a new headliner--

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,500
Franzi Schrempf.

146
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, you mean,          
 the East German gold medalist?

147
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,200
That's her.

148
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,800
She's joining the show     
        here in Boston.

149
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,700
Sure would like
                 to meet her

150
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
without having to go    
        to that stupid ice show.

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mm.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,100
You may be in luck, Norm,

153
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,900
because I invited her      
     and some of the cast

154
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
to drop by here later.

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Oh, boy.   
                     Hey, hey...

156
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
Oh, God, she is amazing.

157
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
She actually grabs the blade

158
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,100
and touches the back            
of her head with it.

159
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,400
Can you do this?

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey, are the kids home?

161
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,900
I haven't talked to them
        since I got back.

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,700
I want to give
                  them a call.

163
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
Oh, yeah, go ahead.             
                    All right.

164
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Just make sure         
 you identify yourself by name.

165
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
Just saying, "It's Dad"

166
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,200
leaves too much room      
         for confusion.

CLIFF:                          
You know, Carla,

168
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,700
according to the, 
              uh, <i>Weekly Gabber,</i>

169
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,500
this Franzi Schrempf
            has affairs

170
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300
with every man    
              she's worked with.

171
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm telling you,  
              she's a man eater.

172
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,200
Look, Clavin,                   
I'm not worried,

173
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,500
so just shut up.

174
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,700
There's a lot of things wrong  
          with Eddie,

175
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,200
but I know I can trust him.

176
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
We've been married          
      for over a year now,

177
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,400
and not once          
      in that entire time

178
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
has his eye wandered.

179
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,600
Well, his good eye.

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,300
I'm talking completely
          over her head.

181
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,900
I mean, she must be,
            like, triple-jointed
            or something.

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,700
Hey, Eddie,                     
Eddie, come here.

183
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,300
You know, I was just laughing  
at something stupid Cliff said.

184
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,500
He says that this Franzi    
          has a thing

185
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,100
for the men she works with.

186
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Says she changes lovers

187
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,300
more times              
 than most people change socks.

188
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't have anything           
to worry about

189
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,000
with you                        
in that area, do I?

190
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
No, honey, not at all.

191
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
I put a fresh pair
              on this morning.

192
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey, here she is.

193
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
Everybody...

194
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,100
I want you to meet
              Franzi Schrempf.

Welcome

198
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
to the bar, Franzi.

199
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,500
We're all, uh...

200
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,700
Well, we're big fans of yours.

201
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,800
Thank you.

202
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
But we were           
        just wondering,

203
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
now that you're here      
         in Boston, um,

204
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,100
well, what are your plans?

205
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Well, while I'm here,      
I would like to wear blue jeans,

206
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,400
see a Tom Cruise movie,     
    and eat a Big Mac.

207
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,900
Whoa. Sexy, dumb,           
    and a cheap date.

spirit of detente,

211
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
I wouldn't mind       
          having some arms talks

212
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,800
with Franzi.

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,700
I'd like to see her try

( <i>laughing</i> )

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
I wouldn't object

to a little mutual 
             on-site inspection.

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
See what kind of payload        
she can deliver.

Hey, Sam,

223
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
she is something, eh?           
                        SAM:    
                        Yeah.

224
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
You know, if I was younger,   
    taller, handsomer,

225
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,500
and had a brain         
          in my head,

226
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,400
I never would have          
     started this sentence.

227
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
You think she's pretty,         
don't you?

228
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,700
Well, yeah, if    
              you're into looks,

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,300
which I'm not.

230
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Just don't get any ideas.

Ideas?

232
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,100
Franzi doesn't    
              even know I exist.

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Eddie, do you have a light?

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
You know, I'm sort of 
          the host here tonight.

235
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,300
I-I better take
                 care of this.

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Sure.

Paper covers rock,

240
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,800
and the mailman goes       
     to the Patriots game.

Oh, that is absurd.

242

You're telling me

243
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,500
that if I took my rock
          and hurled it,

244
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,900
it wouldn't smash

that puny piece
                 of paper?

Oh, will you come on?!

247
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
You're just crying baby shoes

248

'cause you're not going     
          to the game.

Oh...           
                Baby shoes...

251
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,400
there's a much
                  more fair way

252
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,700
to decide this. Now,

253
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,000
foot race to the corner     
        and back.

254

False start. False start!

        under protest.

Carla, I don't think
            you have anything

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
to worry about
                  with Eddie.

259
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,700
But I don't know.

260
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,800
I get this sense of doom.

261
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,100
Maybe it's intuition,           
and maybe it's the fact

262
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
that every time                 
Eddie gets excited,

263
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,500
he starts sweating              
like a ditch digger.

Mom, you'll never believe this.

Say, Franzi, uh,

268
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
you know, I was
                 just thinking,

            new in town,

how about I show you
            our fair city?

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,000
I do not think so.

We have just met.

                    this guy?

289
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,700
We found him face down  
        at the top of the steps.

290
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Never saw him before.

Oh, hey,        
                Mr. Peterson,

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,900
we better hurry,    
            or we're gonna      
            miss the kickoff.

293
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,700
What? Get out of here.

Excuse me.

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,900
I think the guy on the steps    
would like something to drink.

We don't do takeout.

Sammy doesn't spin

314
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,400
( <i>laughs</i> )

315
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Are you sure you're       
     not from around here?

316
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Eddie?

317
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,600
Yes.

318
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,900
Would you be so kind

319
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,200
to give me a lift back     
         to the hotel?

320
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Oh, sure, Franzi.           
        Anything.

321
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,300
You're so sweet.

322
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
( <i>laughs</i> )

323
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,600
CLIFF:
                          Well,

324
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
there he goes, Carla.

325
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,800
Don't say I didn't warn you.

326
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,400
You got to give her credit.

327
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,700
She didn't say it.

328
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,500
Say, uh, Rebecca,               
was it a big hassle

329
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,200
getting those company tickets   
for Woody?

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,100
No.

331
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,200
Can you get some for me?

332
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,300
No.

333
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,200
I get it.                       
Employees only, huh?

334
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,800
No.

335
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Gotcha. Can't go                
to the well too often.

336
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,600
No.

337
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
Then you just don't want        
to get 'em for me?

338
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes.

339
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
Well, no harm in asking.

340
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Man, what is with           
    these East German babes?

341
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
All week long          
      I have been trying:

342
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
phone calls, flowers,      
        the whole thing.

343
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,700
What am I doing wrong?

344
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
Well, Sam, I see
                no alternative.

345
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,000
You're just going           
 to have to become a communist.

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,100
What do you do?

347
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,300
Do you apply for membership   
         or something?

348
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
I cannot believe my ears.

349
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,700
What?

350
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
We're not talking               
about the Moose Lodge here.

351
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
We're talking communists,

352
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,000
the most reprehensible          
perpetrators

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,400
of social and economic          
oppression ever known           
to mankind.

354
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,500
I mean,                         
they brainwash you,

355
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,000
they put you to work            
in some tractor factory,

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and as for your creature        
comforts, forget it.

357
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,200
Yeah, but the stuff you had

358
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,800
before you joined is still      
    your stuff, am I right?

359
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
Ordering.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
What are you ordering, Carla?

361
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,500
I forget.

362
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,400
You know where to reach me.

363
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,800
Carla, are you preoccupied      
or something?

364
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,400
You don't still think           
Eddie's messing around          
with Franzi, do you?

365
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,200
I have my suspicions.

366
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, what evidence             
do you have?

367
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll tell you what I have.

368
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,900
I have nothing!

369
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,700
That was the one good thing
     about Nick.

370
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,200
With Nick,             
         I always knew for sure.

371
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,000
How?

372
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,300
He told me.

373
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,600
I mean,

374
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,300
Nick used to stick Polaroids
    in the family album.

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Carla, you don't have           
anything to worry about.

376
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
I am telling you

377
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,300
Franzi would never date anyone  
from that crummy ice show.

378
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,900
I can't believe that dame!      
She said she can't see me

379
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,800
because she's fallen      
 for some guy in the ice show.

380
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,400
( <i>gasps</i> )

381
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,900
Carla, she's probably           
just saying that

382
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,900
because she wants               
to get Sam to quit bugging her.

383
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
I'll have to remember           
that one.

384
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,500
She's dating somebody,
          all right.

385
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,800
Get a load of this      
        little tidbit of gossip.

386
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,500
"One international skating star
 was seen spooning spaghetti

387
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,700
with a short, dark,    
         melon-faced companion."

388
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Eddie!

389
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,000
SAM:               
             Oh, come on, Carla.

390
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
"Short, dark, melon-faced"?

391
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,700
I mean, that could be anybody  
          in the show.

392
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, guess that explains why

393
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
it's not one of the more        
popular ice shows.

394
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,200
That no-good, two-timing        
scum-sucking, son of a...

395
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,400
Hey, honey bear, come give      
     your lover man a hug.

396
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,500
( <i>screams</i> )

397
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
Hey, Eddie, Eddie.

398
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Hey, do you mind if I borrow  
    Carla here for a minute?

399
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,900
No problem.

400
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,600
It'll give me time          
     to look for my tooth.

401
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Hey, Frasier, help him
          out there, will ya?

402
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,600
Tell him one of your funny      
  psychiatry stories, will ya?

403
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,100
Will you sit down?

404
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Now, what the hell              
do you think you're doing?

405
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
I'm killing           
          the horny little frog!

406
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,100
Just come on.

407
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,800
Come here, will you?

408
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,100
Look, murder is not the answer

409
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,800
to every one                    
of life's little problems,

410
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
you know that?

411
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
First of all,

412
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,100
you don't even know         
    if he did anything wrong,

413
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,800
and second, if he was   
        a little tempted,

414
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
maybe you pushed
                him into it.

415
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, what are you                
talking about?

416
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,100
Did you ever think

417
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,300
that maybe you aren't   
        exactly nice to the guy?

418
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,200
Sammy, you know me.

419
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
This is as nice                 
as it gets.

420
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,000
But this is the way             
you handle everything           
in your life,

421
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
and it never works.

422
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Okay, O God           
     of Good Relationships,

423
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
what do you suggest I do?

424
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,500
Carla, Carla,

425
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,900
you got to let Eddie know   
    how you feel inside.

426
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,800
You must embrace him

427
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
not, not just   
                with your heart,

428
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,800
but with your very soul.

429
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,100
Give unto him and     
          he will give unto you.

430
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Okay, no more for this clown.

431
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Listen,

432
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm talking           
 about the occasional back rub,

433
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,100
the general all-around          
pampering.

434
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,900
You know, maybe buy one of      
 those low-cut, frilly dresses.

435
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,100
Oh, you mean

436
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,300
that "total woman" BS?

437
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,800
I find that           
     completely repulsive.

438
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,500
Well, that explains

439
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
all the men beating down    
     your door, doesn't it?

440
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Listen, you got to become 
      the ideal woman, you know?

441
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,400
Treat him like a god,   
        cater to his every whim.

442
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Oh, yuck! I can't do that.      
I can't do frilly.

443
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,400
You know what they say.

444
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,800
"You can catch more flies     
  with honey than with vinegar."

445
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,400
Maybe I shouldn't           
      be butting in here,

446
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,500
but you can catch the most      
      with dead squirrels.

447
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,800
Come on.

448
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,900
Guys, guys,

449
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,600
I am not going                  
to do this, okay?

450
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm going to get to the         
bottom of it my own way.

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,700
So, I say to this patient,

452
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,100
"Look, you're never going       
to get well

453
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,700
until you get over              
this paranoia."

454
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,200
And he says to me,              
"I was afraid you'd say that."

455
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,200
Well, you had to be there.

456
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,300
Your phone is ringing.

457
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,000
Ooh.

458
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Why did you attack me      
        like that?

459
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm sorry, Eddie.

460
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,800
Look, I've been very tense      
            lately.

461
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
Can I ask you something?

462
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,900
Sure.

463
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,600
Are you happy with me?

464
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,500
Boy, am I.

465
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,800
No complaints?

466
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,600
Not one complaint.

467
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,300
You're lying.

468
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
Everybody has one complaint.

469
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,100
I want one complaint

470
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,600
or I'm not going                
to believe you're happy.

471
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, okay.

472
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
What?

473
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,300
Remember the other night

474
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,500
when I asked you
                if I could have

475
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,300
a few buddies over
              for poker,

476
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,100
and you shoved my face
          into the refrigerator?

477
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,300
Well, I guess      
             I didn't like that.

478
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,000
Listen, Eddie, I want you       
to promise me something.

479
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,800
I want you                      
to promise me

480
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,700
that if you ever find someone  
who makes you happier than I do

481
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,000
that you'll tell me.

482
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Oh, yeah, right.

483
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
What do you mean by that?

484
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,700
You'd kill me.

485
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
No, I won't.

486
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,800
Now tell me the truth.          
Are you having an affair?

487
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,700
No!

488
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,900
Did you believe me

489
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
when I said           
      I wouldn't kill you?

490
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
No!       
Then if you were having         
an affair,

491
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
you would still be saying no!

492
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,100
Yes! And if I weren't   
        having a affair,

493
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,200
I'd still say no!

494
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,900
Honey, look, I got    
          to tell you something.

495
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,200
I have a real bad headache
      from this conversation.

496
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,900
I need to lie down
              in a dark room.

497
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,200
Where do I go for frilly?

498
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,200
All right,                      
I will see your nickel

499
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,600
and I'll raise you              
a nickel.

500
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,900
Too rich for my blood.

501
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,300
Hey, honey,           
      more chips and dip.

502
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Right away,                     
sweetheart.

503
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
Hey, Ed, what's   
              with the old lady?

504
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,900
Why is she     
                 acting so nice?

505
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
I got no idea.         
 She's been doing it all week.

506
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,600
But I got no idea           
    how a car works either,

507
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,100
but I don't mind riding in one, 
              eh?

508
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,300
Shades of the Algonquin         
Roundtable.

509
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,200
Here you are, sweetheart.

510
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Just the way you like it.

511
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
Oh, thanks. I thought   
        you forgot us.

512
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,700
Oh, no! I was just carrying   
another keg in from the garage.

513
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,800
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

514
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,100
Oh, let me get that, baby face.

515
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
And when you're through with  
that, could you grab me a beer?

516
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,600
Anything you want.

517
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,100
Me, too, please.

518
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
What do I look like,            
a waitress?

519
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh, Sam, thank God              
it's you.

520
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
I think I'm hemorrhaging.

521
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,700
Don't worry about it.

522
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,100
I got some great news,
          for you at least.

523
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
I went down to Franzi's         
dressing room,

524
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,800
give her one last chance.

525
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,100
Guess who was there.      
         Her boyfriend.

526
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,900
Her boyfriend was there?

527
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,700
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
And Eddie's here?

529
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,600
Hey, Carla, beer me!

530
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
You think               
Eddie looks like a melon.

531
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
Boy, I tell you,

532
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,600
you put a cantaloupe      
  up next to that guy's face,

533
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,900
I defy you              
    to tell the difference.

534
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Hey, Carla,

535
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,800
Carla, what are you             
doing out there,

536
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,500
growing the hops?

537
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,000
Right away, dear.

538
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,900
You know, maybe I'll join them  
for a couple of hands of cards.

539
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Don't bother.

540
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,700
The game's just         
    about to break up.

541
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,500
Thanks for the warning.

542
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,800
Hey, honey, we're running       
      a little low on dip.

543
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,500
You want some dip?  
Mm-hmm.

544
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,400
Here's your dip               
  and your chips and your drinks

545
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
and your cards.

546
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,100
You want 'em?          
        Help yourselves.

547
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,800
I don't know about you guys.  
      I'm a little bushed.

548
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,300
You know, we really must get    
together like this more often.

549
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,200
Oh, for God's sake, Norm.   
    Let the dog have the dip.

550
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
Now what the hell           
      was that all about?!

551
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
You never laid a hand   
        on that Franzi, did you?

552
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,100
Did you kiss her even?
          Did you pinch her?

553
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,000
Did you do anything?

554
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,300
No, I swear it!

555
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
How could you           
        humiliate me like that?!

556
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,100
Franzi?

557
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Carla, is that                  
what you're all upset about?

558
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,500
You think there's something     
going on

559
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,600
between me and Franzi?

560
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Listen, if that woman      
     threw herself at me,

561
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
I would have nothing      
        to do with her.

562
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,400
In fact, today at rehearsal     
I saw how inhuman she could be.

563
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
She humiliated                  
one of the guys

564
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,100
just because he made            
a little mistake.

565
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
Chewed him out         
     in front of everyone.

566
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,300
Actually spit on him.

567
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,900
If it upset you so much,

568
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,300
why didn't you 
                 defend the guy?

569
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,100
I was the guy!

570
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,400
So nothing was going on

571
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,100
and you let me walk around
      like Debbie Reynolds.

572
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,700
Why didn't you stop me?!

573
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,000
I thought maybe you were
        pregnant again

574
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
and this was your way      
         of telling me.

575
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,900
Well, you didn't have      
      to like it so much.

576
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
Like it?              
          It gave me the creeps.

577
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,800
Well, you certainly seemed      
to like it

578
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,800
when you were making            
all those stupid cracks         
in front of your friends.

579
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,100
Well, you know 
                 the competition

580
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
to be witty            
         in front of those guys.

581
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Besides, honey, I mean,

582
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,800
isn't the important thing   
    I've been faithful to ya?

583
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,100
You have been, haven't you?

584
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,300
Yeah.

585
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,200
Guess I kinda lost              
sight of that.

586
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,100
I was never married to anyone   
who was faithful before.

587
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,900
( <i>scoffs</i> )

588
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,900
You're really                   
a good guy, Eddie.

589
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,600
I don't deserve you,

590
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,200
but I'm going                   
to try to from now on.

591
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm going to be                 
the perfect wife.

592
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,700
I don't want you       
         to be the perfect wife.

593
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,200
I want the girl
                 I married:

594
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,200
feisty, strong-willed,     
     and, well, downright nasty.

595
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,400
In a beautiful way.

596
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,000
You really mean that, Eddie?

597
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,300
Oh, you bet I do.

598
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,100
Then get your sorry butt        
into the kitchen.

599
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
There's a sink full of dishes.

600
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,500
The garbage disposal            
is clogged,

601
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,800
and there's a cat box      
     with your name on it.

602
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
What are you doing?

603
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Oh, my sweetie is back.

604
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,400
Beat it.
