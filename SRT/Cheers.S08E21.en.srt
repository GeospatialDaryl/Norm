Sam, uh, more change,          
 please.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,559
Boy, lilith's really           
 burnin' up the phone there.    
 What's the matter?

4
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:13,845
Oh, you don't want to hear     
 about our troubles.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:17,916
Well, then again,              
 since i've suffered            
 through so many of yours...

6
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:21,636
we're having a devil of a time 
 finding a babysitter           
 for little frederick.

7
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:23,771
Jeez,                          
 what we wouldn't give          
 to get away together.

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,241
Oh, me, too.       
             I live for that.

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,059
Really? Y-y-you could          
 use a vacation?

10
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:30,211
No. I want you guys 
            to go away.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,416
So, you don't have             
 any relatives or friends       
 you can ask to watch the baby?

12
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:37,685
Oh, well, i-i'd gladly         
 ask my parents.

13
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,237
Of course, they're dead.

14
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,357
Well, as for friends, i...

15
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:43,941
sorry. Stupid question.

16
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,645
Frasier, good news.

17
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:49,547
I finally found a woman 
        with whom we can leave  
        our baby for one night.

18
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,049
Oh, great.                 
     Tell me about her.

19
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,484
Well, she's 79 years old,

20
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:56,121
she can't see her hands 
        without her glasses,

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,424
but she assures me      
        she can smell smoke.

22
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,327
Lilith, this is wonderful. 
     At last we'll have a night 
     alone together.

23
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:04,145
Yes, it's just             
     what we need.

24
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:05,447
Our relationship               
 is at a point

25
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:06,848
where the rekindling           
 of romance

26
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,450
is both appropriate            
 and welcome,

27
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:10,452
to say nothing of timely.

28
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,754
Well, stop, lilith.    
         You're getting me hot.

hey, cliffie, your beer        
 tastes a little flat today?

45
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:36,271
No.

46
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:39,307
I don't know.              
     Seems like it's off        
     by maybe a hop or two.

47
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,362
Well, it probably              
 has something to do

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,314
with that new, uh,             
 pasteurization process.

49
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:50,552
You know, they put it in       
 big, uh, sterilized vats...

50
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,654
ahem, yeah,                    
 who gives a hoot?

51
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,708
What? No long-winded   
         explanation?

52
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:58,926
Hmm.

53
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,879
Cliff just isn't       
         himself today, is he?

54
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:02,446
Well,                          
 it's not just mr. Clavin.

55
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,983
I'm feelin'                    
 a little strange, too.

56
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,185
In fact, this whole place      
 feels weird.

57
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,120
Well, you know, woody,

58
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,823
the japanese believe   
         that every house       
         has its own energy,

59
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,959
what they call 
                 its  <i>wa.</i>

60
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:17,128
Now, eastern culture   
         submits

61
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,497
that if this  <i>wa</i>        
        <i>is somehow in disorder,</i>

62
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:23,017
everyone that enters       
     therein will feel          
     a sense of disconnection.

63
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,803
Mr. Clavin, i know          
    why you're not yourself.

64
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,738
Dr. Crane is yourself.

65
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,077
Damn it.

66
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,613
These decorations          
     are all wrong.

67
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,115
This is st. Patrick's day,

68
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,849
the busiest night          
     of the year,

69
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,086
and our name is misspelled     
 on every single item.

70
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:45,257
"Faith & begorrah,             
 from your friends at chees."

71
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:54,498
Rebecca, the decorations   
     are the least              
     of our problems.

72
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,883
I agree.

73
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:57,969
You're right, norm.     
        I think unpaid bar tabs

74
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,771
come a lot higher      
         on our priority list.

75
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:07,027
Damn it, would you         
     look at how                
     they misspelled "cheers"?

76
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,488
Uh, what i'm talkin'   
         about is

77
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,940
if you guys want to worry  
     about somethin',

78
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:22,043
why don't you worry         
    about what evil,            
    rotten practical joke

79
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:24,979
gary's old town tavern         
 is gonna play on us this year.

80
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:29,066
No, no, no, no, no.        
     We're not gonna continue   
     this feud with gary, ok?

81
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,100
What are you talkin' about?

82
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,803
This st. Paddy's day.

83
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,838
It's one of the busiest nights 
 of the year.

84
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,840
It's when gary             
     wheels out the big guns.

85
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:38,793
He can't do anything worse     
 to us than he did last year,   
 remember that?

86
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,161
The place was packed

87
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:44,032
and gary and his goons      
    filled our stairwell        
    with potatoes.

88
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,401
Yeah, just my luck,     
        i was sittin'           
        on the bottom step

89
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:49,253
tying my shoe      
             at the time.

90
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:52,556
Lucky for me you guys      
     were able to dig me out.

91
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:56,527
I'd hate to be              
    the 2nd member of my family 
    buried alive by potatoes.

92
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,468
Well, this year things     
     are gonna be different.

93
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,770
Now, after that    
             potato incident,

94
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,955
i went over there       
        and i had a little chat 
        with gary.

95
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,658
I said we gotta cool it    
     because this stuff         
     is ruining our business,

96
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,210
and he agreed.

97
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:15,847
So we drew up this little   
    document to that effect.

98
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,933
"We, the managers      
         of cheers and gary's   
         old town tavern,

99
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:21,335
do solemnly swear  
             to cut it out."

100
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,422
That ought to               
    hold up in court.

101
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,426
I'll have to do something  
     about these decorations.

102
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,728
What are you going to do,      
 replace 'em?

103
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,563
(Rebecca)           
            no, there's no time 
            for that.

104
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,616
I have to go to the deli   
     and buy some cheese.

105
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:36,517
People will be expecting it.

106
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,457
Can i fill up your beer        
 there for you, norm?

107
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:45,493
Uh, no, thanks.        
         I'm not quite finished 
         with this one.

108
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,017
I'm sorry, i'm sorry.  
         I'm full.

109
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,837
Aw, man, that-that's it.

110
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:58,089
You know,                  
     what--what's going on      
     around here today?

111
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,674
Everybody's actin' weird.

112
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,127
It's time to give              
 old tecumseh a belly rub.      
                 There you go.

113
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,561
Who's tecumseh?

114
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:05,697
You know,                      
 the old wooden indian          
 by the door.

115
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,232
Isn't that phil?

116
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:15,005
Where--where is he?            
 Did--did you guys move him?

117
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,159
Well, spread out.

118
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:21,345
We got to find him here, guys. 
 This is very weird.

119
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,230
I could swear                  
 i saw him here yesterday,

120
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,883
and the day before          
    and the day before that.

121
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,902
No, no, no. That was me.

122
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,724
Sammy, he's not here.

123
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:37,345
Who in his right mind          
 would want to walk off         
 with tecumseh?

124
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,446
(All)                  
         gary.

125
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,214
Oh, man.

126
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,699
Boy, you know, fun is fun,

127
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,136
and i like being               
 humiliated as much             
 as the next guy, but...

128
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,906
yeah, but this,                
 taking tecumseh, that--

129
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,809
that crosses the line!         
                Sammy's right.

130
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll tell you what,     
        he can take cliffie,    
        he can strip him naked,

131
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,480
he can paint him green,     
    tie him up like a shamrock,

 the biggest freudian dream     
 of all time.

 our appointed rendezvous.

     on your night off, huh?

Well, that's what comes        
 from working with your hands.

        recreate our very first 
        romantic liaison.

154

If memory serves,           
    we began with a lovely meal 
    at melville's,

155
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,027
and then an after-dinner   
     drink here,

00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,228

to lilith's tastefully 
         decorated condominium

 in an evening of lovemaking,

159
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,435
which i might say,          
    was rather, um, meaningful.

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,934
Gary made it snow.

271
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:45,289
Gary can't make it snow,   
     grain brain.

272
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,607
Oh, it's a good thing,

273
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,209
'cause we'd never          
     be able to top that.

274
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,064
Hold it. Hold it.  
             Hold it. Hold it.

275
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,566
He may have planted        
     somebody in the bar.

276
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,934
Now, you see               
     any strange faces?

277
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,253
Just, uh, glance around     
    nonchalantly.

278
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,572
Come on,                   
     gary's smarter than that.

279
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,590
He knows we'd be               
 on the lookout for a stranger.

280
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:05,326
So he'd plant          
         somebody we do know.

281
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:09,930
Yeah, probably try to          
 turn one of our own            
 against us.

282
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:13,417
So the idea is,                
 who do we suspect              
 the least?

283
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
I think it's me.

284
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:23,377
Oh. Come on, woody.

285
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,213
How could gary                 
 turn you against us?

286
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,382
I don't know.   
                But if he can   
                make it snow--

287
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,635
he didn't make it snow!        
        He didn't make it snow, 
        you idiot!

288
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,271
All right, just calm down.     
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.              
 Calm down.

289
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,805
Look, i just        
            can't help it, sam.

290
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,692
It's this waiting.     
         It's making me crazy.

291
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,011
I mean, you know gary.         
 He always retaliates.          
 I know, i know.

292
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,063
And with great cruelty         
 and force

293
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,532
and always                     
 within 24 hours.

294
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,252
Boy, i really do               
 respect that guy.

295
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,820
(Norm)                     
     carla's absolutely right.

296
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,288
Every time             
         that damn door opens,

297
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,674
i keep thinking to myself, 
     this could be the big one.

298
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,393
Excuse me.

299
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,929
Is the manager here?

300
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,815
Why? Who wants to know?

301
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,533
I'm the fire marshal.

302
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,935
You're due for your routine    
 6-month inspection

303
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:07,805
for safety code violations.

304
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:08,656
Oh.

305
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:09,990
[Laughing]

306
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:15,362
ahem, well, we're really glad  
 you're here.

307
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,631
Why don't you          
         have a seat?

308
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,199
Can i take your hat?   
         Thanks.

309
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:20,450
Sure.

310
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:22,653
Yeah, you probably  
            want to be checking

311
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,256
if this fire extinguisher  
     is fully operational.

312
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:27,774
Of course.                 
                Ok.

313
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:37,651
What are you doing?

314
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,020
Well, this hat     
             is now up to code.

315
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:45,092
What are you doing?

316
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,829
Well, we're just--             
 we're just, uh,

317
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,964
demonstrating                  
 our fire preparedness.

318
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,800
Gentlemen, uh,                 
 seltzer drill.

319
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,851
(All)                          
 seltzer drill!

320
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,587
Hup! Seltzer drill.

321
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,657
Yo! Yo! Whoa.

322
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,595
[Laughing]

323
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,397
what are you doing?

324
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,769
Oh.

325
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,271
These--these pants             
 were a tinderbox.

326
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:16,590
You guys are crazy.

327
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:18,342
Yeah. Whoo!

328
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,210
[All singing]

329
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:22,980
whoo!

330
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,533
(Rebecca)               
        sam, excuse me.

331
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,085
Will you be sure        
        to let me know

332
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,237
when the fire marshal      
     gets here?

333
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,608
Fi-fire marshal?

334
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:38,629
Yes. We're due for our         
 routine 6-month inspection.

335
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,981
Be sure and tell me            
 when he gets here.

336
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:45,202
Oh, don't worry.               
 I--i have a feeling            
 he'll be in touch.

337
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,605
Guys, guys, guys, guys,        
 we're going nuts here.

338
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,440
I tell you, man,               
 it's just sheer luck

339
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,226
that--that no one was hurt     
 in this situation,

340
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,613
other than rebecca.

341
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,565
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
        This might be part      
        of gary's master plan.

342
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,883
What? What is?

343
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,786
Yeah, keep us on the edge, 
     put us off balance.

344
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,805
Yeah, mr. Clavin's right.      
 You know, i think gary's       
 probably playing with us,

345
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,573
like a rat                     
 with a mouse.

346
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,959
That's cat and mouse,          
 woody.

347
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,778
Cat and mouse.

348
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,097
Sam, a cat and a mouse         
 don't play together.

349
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,265
They're mortal enemies.

350
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,534
They don't even                
 know the same games.

351
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,571
Think before                   
 you speak, sam.

352
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,807
All right, all right,          
 all right, but what do we do   
 about gary, all right?

353
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,177
What are we supposed to do? 
    Just sit here               
    and wait and worry?

354
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:27,978
Well, what other choice 
        do we have?

355
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,396
<i>Fail-safe.</i>         
        <i>What?</i>

356
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,531
Huh?    
        Sure,  <i>fail-safe.</i>

357
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,870
Our situation here          
    greatly parallels that film 
    of the early 1960s

358
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,538
that delighted and, uh, 
        disturbed audiences     
        of that time.

359
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:41,107
So your idea is            
     we-- we schneid ourselves

360
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,410
before gary     
                does it to us?

361
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,078
Should do something            
 to ourselves

362
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,881
to get back                    
 for what we did to gary?

363
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:49,266
Oh, that's crazy.  
             Come on.

364
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,151
All right, wait--wait--        
 wait a minute.

365
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:54,304
It might just convince gary    
 not to do anything to us.

366
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,857
We'd be the master             
 of our own fate.               
                 Yeah.

367
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,675
And, fellows,               
    bottom line is,

368
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:01,328
we'd be getting it over with.  
                 All right.

369
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:02,746
(Sam)                          
 what do you think?

370
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,080
I'll buy it. All right,        
 sammy's right.

371
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:05,766
I say                          
 we screw ourselves!

372
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,634
(All)                   
        screw ourselves!        
        Screw ourselves!

373
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,103
Screw ourselves!

374
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,743
Carla, where are sam           
 and woody?

375
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:18,845
Oh, you'll find out 
            soon enough.

376
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:21,347
Don't worry            
         your flat little head  
         about it.

377
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:24,350
You did not                 
    answer my question,

378
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:27,220
and for your information,      
 my head is not flat.

379
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,163
All right,                     
 but it's not little.

380
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:47,224
Say, carla, uh,            
     where's the inner circle?

381
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,277
Oh, uh, sammy and the guys 
     had to do something,

382
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,062
but they'll be back soon.

383
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:53,897
Oh, don't tell me              
 i missed something.

384
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,632
No.

385
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,317
Now, carla, i expressly    
     posted my beeper number.

386
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:00,204
If anything juicy happens, 
     i'm to be paged.

387
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,173
Frasier, an observation.

388
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:06,026
You are spending               
 way too much time here.

389
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,048
So, uh, how was 
                your night off?

390
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:15,285
Bet you spent                  
 a lot of time worrying         
 about that kid of yours, huh?

391
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,270
No, not a bit.             
     We had a wonderful time.

392
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:18,572
We knew he was                 
 in good hands.

393
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,641
So we just sat back            
 and relaxed.

394
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,928
Well, had a much needed 
        and healthy             
        night away from him.

395
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,628
Oh, that's terrific.

396
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:27,731
Oh, by the way,    
             your sitter called

397
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:30,433
and she said that      
         frederick rolled over  
         by himself

398
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,768
for the first time.

399
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,320
What? And we missed it?

400
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,739
We must be         
             the worst parents  
             in the world.

401
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,327
Frasier, let's rush home,      
 fall to our knees              
 and beg his forgiveness.

402
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:42,996
I'll never get over this,  
     not until the day i die.

403
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:46,349
New parents,           
         they're always suckers 
         for that gag.

404
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,823
Well, my friends,       
        we did it.

405
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,009
We've saved the bar.

406
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,493
[All cheering]

407
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:59,630
(sam)                          
 where's the photographer?

408
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:00,781
Are you the guys?

409
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,266
No, we are the men.

410
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,602
Now, take a photograph         
 of us in all our glory here.

411
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,155
Gentlemen, step right up       
 in a line.

412
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,207
All right. Yeah. Get right...  
 there we go.

413
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,026
Ok, smile, men.                
 This is for the sunday paper.

414
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,195
Fellas, count of 3.

415
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:17,831
1, 2, 3.

416
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,201
[Camera clicking]

417
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,343
and here we go.

418
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,612
[Camera clicking]

419
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,618
ok. I got it. Thanks, guys.    
 Hope it grows back.

420
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,904
Doesn't always, you know.

421
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,889
(Carla)                
         man, you guys!

422
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:44,407
You know,                      
 when i dreamed this gag up,

423
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,977
i never thought             
    you were gonna go through   
    with it.

424
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,431
I just thought you'd get       
 some rubber skull caps         
 or something.

425
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,599
Hey, come on,                  
 give us a little credit here,  
 will you?

426
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,069
When a man has a dirty job     
 to do, he does it.

427
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,455
W-wait a minute,               
 what's that behind your ear?

428
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,425
Nothing. No, no,               
 don't take it off.             
        No, no, no, no, no, no.

429
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,626
[All exclaiming]

430
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:04,928
what the hell?

431
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,614
Guys, we're talking        
     about my hair.

432
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:11,401
Oh, yeah. So?

433
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:15,355
Without my hair,           
     i'd be just                
     just one of you guys.

434
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:16,823
Pardon me, sammy,

435
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:20,143
if that fails              
     to bring a tear to my eye!

436
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:24,514
Fellas, i tried to do it,      
 i swear to god,                
 but, man, i love my hair.

437
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:25,632
All right, fine.

438
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,467
You got a problem           
    with this?                  
                        Yeah!

439
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,386
Let's just step outside 
        right now.

440
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,286
[Men clamoring]

441
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,672
oh, no, wait,                  
 hang on a second, here, huh?

442
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,108
What are we doin'  
             to ourselves?

443
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:37,711
I mean, it's bad enough 
        that gary made us       
        look like fools,

444
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,413
and now we're fightin' 
         amongst ourselves.

445
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,314
This is not        
             part of the deal.

446
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,417
Yeah, woody's right.

447
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,253
Thank you,                 
     mr. Peterson.

448
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,454
Now, let's just relax,

449
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,623
shave sam's head,           
    and discuss this...

450
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,392
[all shouting]

451
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,861
hey, hey, guys, listen up, 
     listen up.                 
     I've got great news.

452
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:56,463
Yeah, listen up.           
 Now, listen, there's no need

453
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,715
to retaliate               
     against ourselves.

454
00:21:58,783 --> 00:21:59,816
What do you mean?

455
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,536
Gary's has been closed      
    for the last month.

456
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:05,171
He's in florida, while his     
 place is being remodeled.

457
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,641
He wasn't even open        
     on st. Patrick's day.

458
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,610
He doesn't even know           
 you guys did anything to him.

459
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:12,445
Isn't that a howl?

460
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,018
This is the worst thing        
 gary's ever done.

461
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,854
We've got to teach             
 gary a lesson.

462
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,957
He must never do               
 nothing again.

463
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:27,427
Men, there's only one thing    
 left to do.

464
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,662
Get gary.

467

No, get gary!           
 Shave sammy!                   
 Shave sammy!
