1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,474
Everybody, step right in here.
Come on.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,519
This is the home of Paul Revere.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,158
- Looks like a bar to me.
- The Reveres liked to entertain.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,669
Walk around
and soak up some atmosphere.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,432
Give me a shot of bourbon.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,677
What's this all about?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,030
It's a walking tour of Boston.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,232
It's 30 degrees outside
and my feet are throbbing.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,874
Paul Revere's house
is nowhere near here.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,553
You wanna do this?

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,794
I gotta fit in five more sites before
six o'clock. I'll never make it.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,358
We are also standing
on the Grainery burying ground,

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,439
the Olde Corner Bookstore
and the Old North Church.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
Let's get going,
this is it for Boston.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,070
- That's the whole tour?
- Seemed to fly by, didn't it?

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,635
<i>Bid a fond adieu to Boston,
the hub of New England.</i>

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,715
I always thought
Boston was a lot bigger.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,831
It is in the summer.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,597
Sure, sister, that'll be fine.

20
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,073
You're welcome.

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,872
I didn't know you had a sister.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,515
That's Sister Theresa
from St Matthias School for Girls.

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,393
She's sending a student
over with a playbill.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,354
St Matthias is a good school. I've
had two kids thrown out of there.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,275
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,477
- What's up, Norm?
- My nipples. It's freezing.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,993
So, how was your Sunday?
Catch the Celtics-75ers game?

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,874
Yes, and the Bruins-Flyers,
the Ramos-Ramos fight.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,718
Australian rules football.

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,799
Tomorrow, Boston College play lona.
Put that money down, pal.

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,311
Doesn't your wife ever complain
you never spend time with her?

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,919
Would you?

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,875
What I can't fathom is how one can
drink cold beer in freezing weather.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,117
- Cliff? Explanation.
- How do you know he has one?

35
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,357
Five bucks says he does,
ten says it's a doozy.

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,874
- When the British ruled Punjab...
- Ten bucks all the way.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,876
.. they drank steaming hot tea
on the hottest days of the year

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,673
to balance the inside
and outside temperatures.

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,758
Conversely, drinking
an ice-cold drink on a cold day

40
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,553
results in a more comfortable
body temperature.

41
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,832
Alright. Why do you drink
ice-cold beer on a hot day?

42
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,678
Mr Clavin?

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,989
What else are you gonna do with it?

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,075
I gotta get rid of a little now.
I'll be in the little boys' room.

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,395
Hop on one leg, big boy.

46
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,990
The pipes are clogged up again.
Nothing's working back there.

47
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,076
Sorry. Go up to Melville's again.

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,395
- Jacket in the same spot?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,398
What a drag, having to dress up
to go to the john.

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,750
Come on.

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,991
You men have it easy.

52
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,078
We have to wear taffeta
and have the correct change.

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,276
Hey, that looks good.
Who's your tailor?

54
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,119
Give me a break.
The sweater's a little bulky.

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,556
Have a good time up there, Ollie.

56
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,030
- I'm in the back with my pipes.
- Wait.

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,720
- I've got an order.
- Carla's got the bar.

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,671
That's right!

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,154
OK, everybody! Carla's got the bar.

60
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,953
You can have anything you want,
as long as it has no ice, straws,

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,471
cherries, olives, mixer,
umbrellas, fruits or flames.

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,671
An order.

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,954
I need an old-fashioned,
a brandy Alexander and a martini.

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,036
Three beers coming up.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,788
The damnedest thing. I've been
shivering all the way over here.

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,832
Coach, you have no coat on,
it's 30 degrees outside.

67
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,428
Thank God, I thought I had malaria.

68
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,796
Are you alright?

69
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,354
I don't know where my mind is today.

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,996
I just remembered,
I left it at Nina's apartment.

71
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,949
- Your mind?
- No, my coat.

72
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,679
Who's Nina?

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,679
A girl who moved into my building
today. I helped her move some stuff.

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,270
It's the damnedest thing.
I kept wanting to smell her neck.

75
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,599
To smell her neck?

76
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,759
- It hit me what that's all about.
- Physical attraction?

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,791
No, Lux.

78
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,351
It used to be the soap of the stars.

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,718
Don't say anything about this
to anybody, please.

80
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,910
- Why?
- It's embarrassing.

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,759
If you're my friend,
you won't say anything, OK?

82
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,394
Coach, you're a normal, healthy man

83
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,159
who's attracted to a woman.
What's wrong there?

84
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,236
She's a lot younger than me.

85
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,191
How much younger?

86
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,552
You'll see, I told her where I work.
She might drop in after she unpacks.

87
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,272
Hello.

88
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,792
Hi, sweetheart.

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,718
You're under arrest. Are you crazy?

90
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,193
That's not her.

91
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,395
- Come on in.
- I'm from St Matthias School.

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,476
Sam said I could put a playbill up.

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,955
- Good.
- What play are you doing?

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,188
<i>It's a production
of Twelve Angry Men,</i>

95
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,754
a taut, absorbing
psychological drama.

96
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,269
<i>When I was your age,
we did Romeo and Juliet.</i>

97
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,994
We were looking for something
with more meat.

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,838
Thank you.

99
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,554
You're welcome, honey.
I'll hang it up for you.

100
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,917
- Hi, Ernie.
- Nina, hi. Welcome to Cheers.

101
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,476
Boy, it's nice and warm in here.
My apartment is freezing.

102
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,070
I hope it's OK, the super's gonna
call me here when the heat's on.

103
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,715
It's a great idea.
Sit down, I'll show you the place.

104
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,391
Have a seat. Now, let's see.

105
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,556
This is the bar.

106
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,950
Those are the bottles.
These are the glasses.

107
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,353
That's a stool. Any questions?

108
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,792
I've always wondered what gas you use
to pressurise those beer kegs.

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,632
Probably unleaded.

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,116
- Can I get you a drink?
- White wine.

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,676
White wine. Diane, Nina. Nina, Diane.

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,075
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,997
Diane is very smart.
Say something very smart.

114
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,715
<i>Tempus fugit.</i>

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,118
- Coach, she's adorable.
- Isn't she?

116
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,270
Carla, come over a minute, will you?

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,356
I'm busy.

118
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,716
Carla's been in a lousy mood
for the last two, three years.

119
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,996
It's getting strange up there.

120
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,192
That's Norm.
That's not Norm's jacket.

121
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,676
- How do you mean, strange?
- That new men's room attendant.

122
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,918
The guy hands me a towel, whisks me
off and invites me out to a movie.

123
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,550
Guys, meet Nina.
She just moved into my place.

124
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,676
No, not my apartment, my building.

125
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,559
Crazy guys, but nice.

126
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,558
I'd still be dragging my box spring
without Ernie.

127
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,671
You're a dog, Coach.

128
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,353
Honey, excuse me.
I gotta check the backroom.

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,677
- That's it for me.
- That's Sam.

130
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,075
He's handsome. He's a bit of a wolf.

131
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,389
I don't know what to do.
Anyone know anything about plumbing?

132
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,479
Well, the Romans had
an elaborate system of aqueducts.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,389
They were sort of
the forerunners of...

134
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,115
Cliff. I need somebody
to help me fix the plumbing.

135
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,070
Sorry, Sammy. Strictly theory.

136
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,988
- Let me do it.
- Give me a break.

137
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,395
Come on. I'm an expert at this stuff.

138
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,795
I've got four kids and one bathroom.

139
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,276
My kids gave me Drano
for Mother's Day.

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,630
Give me that wrench.
I'm going in there.

141
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,954
Go get them.

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,276
Everybody out of the men's room.

143
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,834
Why didn't you say that
before you came in?

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,231
- Give me two beers.
- Excuse me.

145
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,518
Sam! I know what you're going to do.

146
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,871
I can't explain now.
Just stay away from that woman.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,877
What woman?

148
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,511
Actually, I was going for a coffee.

149
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,677
Thanks for pointing her out.
I must be slipping.

150
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,233
Please, I can't tell you why,
but it's just not right.

151
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,672
OK. Alright.

152
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,673
If you insist.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,072
Wait a minute.

154
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,480
I understand
something about psychology.

155
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,754
By telling me not to go,
you're trying to get my curiosity up

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,115
so I do exactly the opposite, right?

157
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,832
Absolutely not.

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,678
No!

159
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,070
Probably a friend of yours?

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,988
The two of you cooked something up
to make me look a silly fool?

161
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,873
- I'm not going anywhere near her.
- Thank you.

162
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,272
Thank you?

163
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,959
That's what you wanted me to do,
walk away.

164
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,674
- You don't want me going near her.
- No.

165
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,071
No meaning yes. Listen, this is
my bar and I'll do what I want.

166
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,478
Hi, there.

167
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,635
Hi.

168
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,751
You new in the neighbourhood?

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,952
- Yeah, I'm new to Boston.
- How do you like it so far?

170
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,277
- Fine, how do you like it?
- Much better now.

171
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,670
Sorry about this stuff. I'm sat here
waiting for my heat to be turned on.

172
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,836
How hot do you want it to get?

173
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,631
I heard you were kind of a wolf.

174
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,078
Howl at the moon one time,
they never let you forget it.

175
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,397
Listen. While we're
on the subject of subgum,...

176
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,630
.. how would you like
to go out to Chinese food later?

177
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,990
No, thank you. I'd rather not.

178
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,676
Did I make it clear I meant with me?

179
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,919
Painfully.

180
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,076
I think I like this girl.

181
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,476
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go say goodbye to my bathroom.

182
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,472
Congratulations, Diane.

183
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,479
You and your friend made me look
a complete ass. I hope you're happy.

184
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,874
- Couldn't have done it without you.
- Isn't she great?

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,515
You know, Coach,
I think you should ask her out.

186
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,198
Ask her out?

187
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,598
I haven't asked a girl out in years.
I don't know if my old lines work.

188
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,472
What was the last one you used?

189
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,078
"How would you like
a pair of nylons, Fräulein?"

190
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,953
- Probably not.
- Come on. It worked.

191
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,675
What do we need it for?
It's just another piece to clog up.

192
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,392
It's belongs to something.

193
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,034
Don't hang on to things
through sentiment.

194
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,599
Coach, how about all the women
you talk about in your baseball days?

195
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,871
- How did you approach them?
- Not by talking with them.

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,479
What did you do?

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,674
I'd spot a cute dame in the stands
and to get their attention, I'd...

198
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,072
.. injure myself.

199
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,388
- You intentionally hurt yourself?
- Sure.

200
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,274
I'd lean into a pitch
or dive face-first into a bag.

201
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,995
Take a hard grounder in the gut,
anything to get their sympathy.

202
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,551
You were a sly one, Coach.

203
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,593
One day I wasn't even in the game
and there was this real cutie there.

204
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,950
So I threw myself
down the dugout steps.

205
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,593
- It worked.
- You don't have to do that now.

206
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,318
Look at her.

207
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,479
She's all by herself,
a stranger in this big city.

208
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,795
You are the only friend she has here.

209
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,076
- Can we have some service back here?
- Coming right up.

210
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,111
Go get her, tiger.

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,075
- Coach. Can you cover me tonight?
- Sure, where you going?

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,792
I'm going out with that lady.

213
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,276
Diane is gonna learn the meaning
of the word comeback.

214
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,476
Did you say something?

215
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,636
Like...?

216
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,438
- Yeah.
- That wasn't me.

217
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,276
Can I have another beer, please?

218
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,869
- Coach, what's going on here?
- Just a normal evening.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,673
I'm pouring a beer. Norm's in line.

220
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,236
Sam's sweeping the girl of my dreams
off her feet. Normal night.

221
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,390
I thought you were gonna do that.

222
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,150
Come on, Sam's such a smoothie.
When did a woman last turn him down?

223
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,271
Will you bug off?

224
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,076
- Does that refresh your memory?
- I got her on the ropes.

225
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,674
- You're a glutton for punishment.
- The evening's young.

226
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,075
But your lines are old.

227
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,516
Don't worry. I'm going out with your
friend tonight, even if it kills me.

228
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,873
Coach, come on.
Now's your chance. Go.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,117
- Diane, who needs her?
- Coach.

230
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,109
- Don't give up on Nina.
- Please leave me alone. Please.

231
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,989
No!

232
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,669
Get in there, you pipe,
and no backtalk.

233
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
You can't come in here,
it's the men's room.

234
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,712
- Carla's in here.
- Carla doesn't count.

235
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,671
Watch it!

236
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,677
- Diane, please, I want to be alone.
- Coach, if you don't act now,

237
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,078
your life will be forever haunted
with the memory of lost opportunity.

238
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,671
Maybe you're right, I should've tried
earlier, but Sam's after her now.

239
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,315
- Can't you see that?
- So? He's not getting anywhere.

240
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,476
- You got the hots for Nina?
- You know that, too?

241
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,112
Carla, Coach is too shy
to ask Nina out.

242
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,870
Come on, will you? Who wants
to date me? I'm over the hill.

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,595
Nothing could be further
from the truth. I'd go out with you.

244
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,280
- Really?
- I would, too.

245
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,472
See? And we all know
how fussy Carla is.

246
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,075
- You're not just saying this?
- No.

247
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,876
Coach, you're a cutie.
Come on over here, cutie.

248
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,080
Look at you. What a hunk!

249
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,114
You're a pin-up guy.
Look at those shoulders.

250
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,390
Stop it, the two of you.

251
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,229
Who is that stud?

252
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,271
I'm no Harold Flynn, but it's OK.

253
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,879
Coach, it's Errol Flynn.

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,879
No, Harold Flynn. He used to play
second base for Chicago.

255
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,631
Good look, no hit.

256
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,399
Diane, Carla,

257
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,590
I'm gonna do it.

258
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,075
Just give me a few minutes
to spruce up.

259
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,072
Listen, Coach, that's great.
I'll make sure Nina sticks around.

260
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,356
I can't believe the graffiti
in this place.

261
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,471
Adolescent men are...

262
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,514
What is it?

263
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
"For a good time,
call Diane Chambers. "

264
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,276
Thank God
they got the number wrong.

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,119
I got it right off your application.

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,669
- Carla, how could you?
- Last time I play Cupid for you.

267
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,713
After our moonlight drive
up to the Cape,

268
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,115
we'll check into separate rooms,

269
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,549
one for us, one for our toothbrushes.

270
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,510
- I wish you could bottle that charm.
- Is that right?

271
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,756
Then I could put a cork in it.

272
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,990
Sammy? Could I get a beer down here?

273
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,272
I'll be back.

274
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,238
Tell me you're not in trouble.

275
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,670
Tell me you're playing around
with her, or I can't go on.

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,518
I'm just playing with her.

277
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,276
Just playing around with her...

278
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,079
Give up. It takes a big man
to admit he's a small person.

279
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,877
And now Harvard Yard.

280
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,114
It was here that in 1535

281
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,994
John Harvard raised
his eyes to heaven and announced...

282
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,190
Line up, the can is fixed.

283
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,279
I let you do this one time but
no more. I don't want you come back.

284
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,079
Sorry about this.
They're studying for finals.

285
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,431
Let's give a little consideration
and tiptoe out.

286
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,197
Seems like all we've done all day
long was go from one bar to another.

287
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,874
What do you want for eight bucks?
Minutemen?

288
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,799
Move it.

289
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,074
Nina, your super called.
Your heat's back on.

290
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,679
Thanks, Carla.

291
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,717
I sense that we've had some trouble
hitting it off tonight

292
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,876
but I think I know why.

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,915
Put aside for now my technique,
my style, my smooth manner.

294
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,477
Put aside my hair,
my teeth, my physique.

295
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,478
Put all that aside
and what have you got?

296
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,751
Nothing.

297
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,078
I didn't feel like being with
a woman tonight. Goodnight, Nina.

298
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,070
It turns out we were cousins.

299
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,874
Nina, can you wait just a minute?
The Coach wanted to say goodbye.

300
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,479
OK.

301
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,068
I give up. The woman's undateable.

302
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,354
Undateable, Sam? I don't think so.

303
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,877
In fact, I have a hunch you're about
to see that woman swept off her feet.

304
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,877
You're crazy.

305
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,276
It may seem impossible to you,
one whose idea of romance

306
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,676
<i>is a floormat
and The Bolero played at 78,...</i>

307
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,275
.. but you are about to see
a man get a date

308
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,949
using nothing
but sincerity and his own feelings.

309
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,877
She's kinky, huh?

310
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,156
- The Coach?
- He's crazy about her.

311
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,874
I'd have told you
but he swore me to secrecy.

312
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,788
- He's been building up his courage.
- Stop him, she'll crush him.

313
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,239
Nina?

314
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,070
Ernie. I was waiting
to say goodnight.

315
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,278
Listen, Nina,
I want to say something.

316
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,995
Look, I'm not a rich guy,
and I'm no brain.

317
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,997
I'm just an average guy.

318
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,795
But I like you and I'd like to go out
and do things with you.

319
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,070
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

320
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,398
That's sweet of you, but I've got
a lot of unpacking to do, but thanks.

321
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,077
Yea. Sure.

322
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,076
Coach.

323
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,076
Look, I got shot down, too.

324
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,670
Listen. There are some women
in this world you can't get to.

325
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,270
- She's all of them.
- I made reservations upstairs.

326
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,195
Goodnight.
It was nice to meet you all.

327
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,156
- Goodnight, Ernie.
- Bye, Nina.

328
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,678
Coach!

329
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,670
- He's out like a light.
- Wake up.

330
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,871
Ernie, are you alright?

331
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,434
- Are you OK?
- I'm just a little woozy.

332
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,678
- Coach, let me take you home.
- Let me, I live there, anyway.

333
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,872
- You've got all that unpacking.
- Don't be silly.

334
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,037
