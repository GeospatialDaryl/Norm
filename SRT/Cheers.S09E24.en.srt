2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,800
        Oh, Woody.              

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,600
Our baby-sitter                 
just canceled.                  

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,200
         Could you sit          
    with Frederick tonight?     

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,300
                     Okay.      

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,900
Oh, great, Woody.               
Thanks.                         

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,000
        Yeah, I'm used to it.   

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,900
              I used to baby-sit
        a lot back in Hanover...

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,700
      well, before the incident.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
          You know...           

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
I think Lilith's mother         
owes us a favor.                

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,900
Thanks anyway, Woody.           

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,200
                Oh, good, Woody,
         come here for a minute.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,800
        Listen, I'm gonna go out
         of town for the weekend

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,100
                  and I want you
                 to feed my cat.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,500
  Now I know it's an imposition,
                  but, you know.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
    Okay.                       

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,900
        Well, you're really good
    with animals, aren't you?   

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,500
    Well, yeah.                 

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,100
I mean, I had lots of pets      
back in Hanover...              

21
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
before the incident.            

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,600
                    Yeah, Woody,
              on second thought,

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,900
                I'm gonna ask   
          my next-door neighbor,

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,500
              but thanks anyway.

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,700
                     Hey, Woody,

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,900
                 that's a really
                clever trick.   

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,500
            You get out of doing
             anything with that.

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,800
             Yeah.              

29
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,700
  Just wish I'd thought of it   
      before the incident.      

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,700
      (theme song begins)

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,700
We realize                      
it's short notice,              

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,000
but this dinner tonight         
is something                    

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
we simply cannot miss.          

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
We're desperate                 
to get a sitter.                

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,700
      I would really like       
     to help you guys out,      

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
 but children make me nervous.  

44
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm afraid I'm gonna drop them. 

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,500
            Oh, Rebecca...      

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200
            holding a baby is   
              the simplest thing

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,200
in the world.                   

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,500
         (glass breaks)         

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
  I'm sorry. What did you say?  

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
            Thanks anyway.      

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
             Kelly,             

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,900
                  how was class?

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
        (sighs heavily):        
 I'd rather not talk about it.  

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
    I'm sorry, Woody.           

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
I didn't mean to jump down      
     your throat like that.     

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,000
                     Well, uh...

57
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,200
              what's wrong?     

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
     Well, my final project     
         for sociology          

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
      is an in-depth study      
of a past work experience.      

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,700
And I've never had a job.       

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I don't know                    
what I'm gonna do.              

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
        Well, let me get        
        this straight--         

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
            you can't do your   
        little school project   

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,900
                  because you're
                stinkin' rich   

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
    and you never had to work   
             a day in your life?

66
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,500
    Yeah.                       

67
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,800
          And I used to complain
         because I had no shoes.

68
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,800
     I feel so out of place     
     in my sociology class.     

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
Do you know what it's like      
    to sit in school all day    

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,900
  and not contribute anything?  

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,100
    Well, it's been a long time,
    but that sounds familiar.   

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,900
    I don't even know           
    how to get a job.           
                          Kelly,

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,700
        come over here, here.   

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
                    Want ads.   
                        Okay?   

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
        Plenty of jobs in there.

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,500
            If you can't find   
                 anything there,

77
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,900
      call an employment agency.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,700
                Plenty of places
                to get a job.   

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,200
Hey, you know, Norm,            
for a guy who's unemployed,     

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
you certainly know a lot        
about getting work.             

81
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,000
             Well, Cliff, I know
         a lot about water, too,

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
            but you don't see me
                    drinking it.

83
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,000
                Uh, Ms. Howe,   
                    do you think

84
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,900
                Kelly could work
            here for a while?   

85
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,200
         I know she doesn't have
            any experience...   

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
I don't think so, Woody.        

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
                Oh, well, I just
                thought I'd ask.

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,000
            It's no big deal.   

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
          Look, Woody.          

90
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,000
    It says here I can make     
         $10,000 a week         

91
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
        being an escort.        

92
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,500
        Okay, Ms. Howe,         
      now it's a big deal.      

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,700
                 Please, please,
              let her work here.

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
              You can always use
                an extra hand   

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
                and you don't   
                have to pay her.

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,900
                 Yeah, it's just
             for the experience.

97
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,900
All right, Woody,               
all right.                      

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,900
As a favor to you.              

99
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,400
But this is                     
a real business.                

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
This is not                     
a training ground.              

101
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
We need people to work here who 
really know what they're doing. 

102
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,500
         (glass breaks)         

103
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Tell her to wear shoes.         

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
            Thanks, Ms. Howe.   

105
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,200
    Hey, Kelly, guess what?     

106
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,700
Ms. Howe said                   
you can work here.              

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,700
                         Really?
            Oh, that's great.   

108
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,100
        Oh, thanks, Ms. Howe.   

109
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,500
Oh, welcome aboard, Kelly.      

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,800
                 I can't believe
              I have a real job.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,100
You know what                   
to do with this.                

112
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,800
                 Wow, I sure do.

113
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
    Do you guys have lobster    
      for lunch every day?      

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,500
      Well, does that mean      
you're canceling tonight?       

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
     All right, all right.      

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,700
  Well, maybe some other time.  

117
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Boy, women'll break a date      
 with you at the drop of a hat. 

118
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,600
      Like her grandmother      
 won't still be dead tomorrow.  

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,900
Sam, am I to understand that you
 suddenly have the night free?  

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
 Yeah, you got anything for me? 

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
                  Perhaps.      

122
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,900
                  Quite cute.   

123
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,200
        Oh, yeah?               
          Cute's nice.          

124
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
                 And young.     

125
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,800
    Oh, I like young.           

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
     Give me more details.      

127
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,900
     Well, about 32 inches.     

128
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,600
     I usually I like them      
  a little bustier than that.   

129
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
     I'm just trying to find out

130
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,500
        if you would like to sit
          for Frederick tonight.

131
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
        Oh, yeah.               
      I'd love to do that.      

132
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
            Really?             
    I love that little guy.     
            Why not?            

133
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
            Done deal.          
                      All right.

134
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,100
Frasier, can I                  
speak with you?                 

135
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know how comfortable    
I feel with this setup.         

136
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,600
He's just a baby.               
He needs supervision.           

137
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,300
                Well, Sam can   
                take care of it.

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm talking about Sam.          

139
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,800
You know how out of control     
he can get at times,            

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
what a mess he can              
make of everything.             

141
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,100
      Well, Sam can clean it up.

142
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
              Oh, you're talking
                      about Sam.
I'm talking about Sam.          

143
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,100
             Darling, it'll just
             be for a few hours.

144
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,200
All right.                      

145
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
But if anything goes wrong,     
he could be scarred for life.   

146
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,900
            You mean Sam, right?

147
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
Yes, and it is a threat.        

148
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,300
Sam, can you be at our place    
in about an hour?               

149
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,000
            You bet.            

150
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,600
    Where are you guys          
         going tonight?         

151
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
 Oh, well, I'm proud to tell you
             that my lovely wife

152
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
        is being honored tonight
     by the scientific community

153
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,300
    for her contributions to the
study of sensory deprivation.   

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,500
It was serendipitous,           
I admit.                        

155
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,500
I'd returned to the lab         
after a two-week holiday        

156
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
to find that I'd locked         
my lab assistant                

157
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
in the isolation tank.          

158
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,600
Suffice it to say, what could   
have been an ugly lawsuit       

159
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,500
turned into                     
an award-winning paper.         

160
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
                     Say, Carla,

161
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,200
 I'm, uh, baby-sitting tonight. 

162
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
You got any advice for me?      

163
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,300
Sure. Here's everything         
you need to know about babies.  

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,700
Remember,                       
you're the boss.                
                        Yeah.   

165
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't let him                   
give you any lip.               

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
And if they start               
to act crabby,                  

167
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,800
stick a bottle                  
in their mouths.                

168
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,300
                     Great.     

169
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,000
                    Okay, great.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,700
          Okay, I'm ready.      
Okay.                           

171
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Here's everything you need      
to know about customers.        

172
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
Remember,                       
you're the boss.                

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
Don't let 'em                   
give you any lip.               

174
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,900
And if they start               
to act crabby,                  

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
just stick a bottle             
in their mouths.                

176
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,000
Hey, Miss.                      
I ordered a beer.               

177
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,800
  And he passes to Frederick.   

178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
    Frederick takes the ball    
      and goes for a jam.       

179
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
        Yes! Yes!               

180
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,800
        He's a freshman         

181
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,700
  out of the learning center.   

182
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,200
              Yes!              
         Oh, a rookie.          

183
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,400
        Wonderful shot.         

184
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
          Here we go.           
    Take another one.           

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
      He goes for the jam.      

186
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,500
    He goes. He runs.           

187
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,700
  The Garden is going cra....   

188
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,600
Oh. It's...                     

189
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,500
Great shot.                     

190
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,900
          Great shot.           

191
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,800
Okay, Malone, top of the key... 

192
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,400
      Do you want to watch      
          a little TV?          

193
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,900
    (pants slightly):           
      You know something?       

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
      That's a good idea.       

195
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,100
        Uncle Sam               
    is a little tired here.     

196
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,300
Whoo!                           

197
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
     Good idea, good idea.      

198
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,600
I don't know how to do this one.

199
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,300
Do you know how to...           

200
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,200
I have a different one          
at home there.                  

201
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,600
         (TV clicks on)         
      Oh, far out. Thanks.      

202
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,800
         That's great.          

203
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,700
        Oh, great,              
    this is <i>The Flintstones.</i>    

204
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
  This is the one where Barney  
gets stuck in the mailbox.      

205
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,300
I actually haven't seen this one
    all the way to the end.     

206
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,100
            Freddie?            

207
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
        Hey, Fred,              
    whatcha doing in there?     

208
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,500
          Peek-a-boo!           

209
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,700
    (doorknob rattles)          

210
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
            Freddie?            

211
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,900
             Uh-oh.             

212
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,100
         Uh... oh, boy.         
             Fred.              

213
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,200
     Hey, listen to me now.     
     Listen to Uncle Sammy.     

214
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,800
Unlock the door, Freddie.       

215
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,300
  T... Freddie, turn the knob.  

216
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,700
    You see the knob?           
     See that little knob?      

217
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,400
    Turn the knob, Freddie.     

218
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
        (toilet flushes)        

219
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
     No, wrong knob, Fred.      

220
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
             Shoot.             

221
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
      Um, okay, all right.      

222
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
I'll get you out of there.      

223
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,500
  Got to be a key around here.  

224
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,100
        (giggles)               

225
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,900
        Oh, I know what         
      I'm gonna do, Fred.       

226
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,300
  We'll do the old credit card  
  jimmying the lock open here.  

227
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,200
  I don't have a credit card.   

228
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
      I know, here, here,       
        I'll use a $20.         

229
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,500
      This is gonna work.       
      This is gonna work.       

230
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,100
Yeah, here we go, Freddie.      

231
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,200
      This is gonna work.       

232
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,800
     No, Freddie... hey...      

233
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,500
      give me my $20 back.      

234
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,700
        (toilet flushes)        
        Fred, no.               

235
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
    Don't fl... oh... shoot.    

236
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,600
         You little...          

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
      I'm in trouble here.      

238
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
    Okay, don't worry.          

239
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,900
  Uncle Sammy's gonna get you   
     out of there, Freddie.     

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,100
  Yeah, I'll just come around   
        the window here.        

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,300
              Ooh.              

242
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,000
We're way high, aren't we?      

243
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
             Okay.              

244
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
          No big deal.          

245
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,800
              Ooh.              

246
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,300
             Okay.              

247
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,500
          Here we go.           

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
    Here comes Uncle Sammy.     

249
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,700
        Oh, yeah.               

250
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,500
        Oh, yeah.               
         Burglar-proof.         

251
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
          Right. Yeah.          

252
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,200
  Your mommy and daddy told me  
    about that, didn't they?    

253
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
             Okay.              

254
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
         Hey, Freddie.          

255
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,300
             Whoo!              

256
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,500
            (groans)            

257
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
    Damn, damn, damn!           

258
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,800
 You didn't hear that, Freddie. 

259
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,000
     You didn't hear that.      

260
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,600
        (groans):               
             Oh...!             

261
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
            Damn it!            

262
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
You heard that one, didn't you? 

263
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,900
        Hey, Freddie...         

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,100
    Uncle Sammy doesn't know    
        what to do here.        

265
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Can you open this window?       

266
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
  Do you know the word "open"?  

267
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,600
Yeah, yeah, open.               

268
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,400
             Open.              

269
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
    Can you open the window?    

270
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,100
 D-do you know the word "open"? 

271
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,300
        Good boy.               

272
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
                        Bye-bye.

273
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,400
Carla, I just waited            
on a man at table 5             

274
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
and he left too much            
money on the table.             

275
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,700
Should we go find him?          

276
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
        No, uh, you see, this   
          is what we call a tip.

277
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,500
     It's a little monetary gift
          for the head waitress.

278
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,700
    Here you go.                

279
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,200
Boy, do I feel dumb.            

280
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,700
        Oh, no, you're just new.

281
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
            Kelly, can I have   
                 a beer, please?

282
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
Okay, let me go get Woody.      

283
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,100
 Oh, no, you don't need Woody.  

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
            Come here. I'm gonna
         show you how it's done.

285
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,900
                Take a glass,   

286
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,400
             stick it underneath
          this black lever here,

287
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
                     okay?      

288
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,800
         Voilá, you have a beer.

289
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Now there's a, uh, black book   
underneath the cash register.   

290
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,100
     It says "Norm's tab" on it.

291
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,500
     You mean this one here     
  with all these little marks?  

292
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
             Right.             

293
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,500
 Now, Kelly, each one of these  
          little marks          

294
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,900
     represents a beer that     
 I've purchased... in advance.  

295
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,700
    Every time I order one,     
  you have to take this eraser  

296
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,300
    and, uh, erase one          
     of those little marks.     

297
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Don't forget to erase now.      

298
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,700
  I don't want any free beers!  

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,900
      Okay, Mr. Peterson.       

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,900
                      Thank you.

301
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
Unbelievable!                   

302
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm in the presence             
of sheer genius.                

303
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
              Thank you, Cliffy.

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
            Kelly, can I have   
                    another beer

305
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
              for my dear friend
                Clifford Clavin?

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,300
    And what the heck,          
      take it off my tab.       

307
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,100
         Hey, Freddie!          
      (knocking on window)      

308
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,800
Freddie, Uncle Sammy needs      
      some help here, bud.      

309
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,300
        Hey, Fred,              
    do you know about rain?     

310
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
Because that's what's happening 
    out here, Freddie.          

311
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,500
You know...                     

312
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,300
      ¶ Itsy-bitsy spider       
    went up the waterspout ¶    

313
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,500
    (thunder rumbling)          

314
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay, Fred.                     

315
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,400
Look, back away from the window 
          there, Fred.          

316
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,700
Uncle Sammy's gonna break       
         the window...          

317
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,400
     and every little bone      
          in his hand.          

318
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,000
              Oh!               

319
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
          Okay, Fred.           

320
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,200
Tell you what I'm gonna do here.

321
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,900
I'm gonna jump over to that tree
    and climb on down.          

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,600
     I'll be back in just,      
before you can... Oh! Oh!       

323
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,500
(crashing)                      

324
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
              Bye.              

325
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,500
        Carla, I need to ask you
    some questions for my paper,

326
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
      since you're my co-worker.

327
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,100
            How do you feel that
             the work experience

328
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,800
         has enriched your life?

329
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,900
It's given me varicose veins,   
stomach acid, lower back pain   

330
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,500
and a complete hatred           
for all mankind.                

331
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,900
            That's great.       

332
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,200
     And what would you say     
are the negative aspects?       

333
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,000
      Just do the dishes.       

334
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,700
             Yeah.              
     I hate that one, too.      

335
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,700
  We have an Australian couple  
      that do it at home.       

336
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,700
                    Oh...       

337
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,800
 By the way, here's another one 
      of those tip things.      

338
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,100
Why, thank you very much, Kelly.

339
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,400
Boy, she is really dumber       
          than cotton.          

340
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,100
          Hey, Carla.           

341
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,600
          Hey, Cotton.          

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
            Who's ready, huh?   
                    You thirsty?

343
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,000
                        Come on.

344
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,700
         Norm, come on.         
      Let us buy a round.       

345
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,100
                    I insist.   

346
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,300
      Kelly, another round      
for my friends here, okay?      

347
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,100
      Okay, Mr. Peterson,       

348
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,500
 but my hands are getting sore  
     from all that erasing.     

349
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,900
        Now, now, Kelly,        
     you wanted a real job.     

350
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,000
You can't go through life       

351
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
getting everything handed       
        to you for free.        

352
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,800
 Let's get some beer over here. 

353
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
          How about you fellows?
                      You ready?

354
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,600
Oh, we've really got            
to get back to the site, Norm.  

355
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,200
  Come on. You're only working  
      on the second floor.      
Yeah!                           

356
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,000
    A round for these guys.     

357
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,200
          Hey-hey-hey,          
     isn't that that Henri?     

358
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
                    Oh, yeah,   

359
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
it's Pepe LePew himself.        

360
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Yeah, he's got                  
a lot of guts                   

361
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
showing his sleazy Gallic mug   
around this place.              

362
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
                        Yeah.   

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,100
      If I was, uh, Woody,      

364
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
    I'd have popped that guy    
a long time ago, you know?      

365
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,400
        Hello, fellows!         

366
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,200
              ALL:              
          Hey, Henri!           

367
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,900
                What do you say?
                 Buy you a beer?

368
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,600
And he's such a phony, you know?

369
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,800
Uh, Woody, loan me              
ten dollars until payday.       

370
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,900
              When's payday?    

371
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
         How do I know?         
 You're the one who's working.  

372
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,100
                          Kelly!

373
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,500
              What are you doing
              with those drinks?

374
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
Hello, Henri.                   

375
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,100
 I'm working here for a while.  

376
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
      Isn't that exciting?      

377
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
Yes, you are!                   

378
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,100
                Serve me a drink

379
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,600
             so that I may pinch
    your bottom as you leave.   

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
        Henri, I wish you'd stop
        saying things like that.

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,300
Well, Woody,                    
but I am the customer,          

382
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
and the customer                
is always right.                

383
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,300
                        Darn.   

384
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,100
    Got me on a technicality.   

385
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,800
 You know, if this Kelly thing  
        works out,              

386
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,200
    I might finally be able     
      to take my vacation.      

387
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
    The last one I had          
      was three years ago       

388
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,400
    when I went to Graceland    
         for a weekend.         

389
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,700
    But now I got six weeks     
        saved up.               

390
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,300
    I'm gonna take me           
        a real vacation.        

391
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,700
         Where are you gonna go?

392
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
    Graceland.                  

393
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,100
Woody, may I have a soda,       
            please?             

394
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,700
    Stealing your girlfriend    
        is thirsty work.        

395
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,100
    All right, Henri,           

396
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,100
  I don't know how things are   
        in France,              

397
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,100
        but in America,         
guys don't like other guys      

398
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,300
saying they're gonna steal      
    their girlfriend.           

399
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
        It's not polite.        

400
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
     Oh! I'm, I'm so sorry.     

401
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
      I, I see your point.      

402
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Uh, as we say in France...      

403
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,300
  <i>Je vais te piquer ta copine.</i>  

404
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,500
      What does that mean?      

405
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
    I'm going to steal          
        your girlfriend.        

406
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Wait a minute.                  

407
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
You take that back.             

408
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,900
                  Oh!           

409
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,300
    I-I...                      

410
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
What are you doing?!            

411
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,200
            What are you doing?!

412
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,900
    Oh, hey, Freddie!           

413
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
        I'm back.               

414
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,600
    I must have blacked out     
    there for a while.          

415
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,200
             Whoo!              

416
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Uncle Sammy sure is lucky       

417
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,300
    the glass recycling bin     
        broke his fall.         

418
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,700
         I'll tell you.         

419
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,300
Somebody sure drinks a lot      
 of wine in this building. Uh!  

420
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
You look all tuckered out there.

421
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,700
    What do you say we watch    

422
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,300
        a little,               
 a little television here, huh? 

423
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,000
        Oh, shoot!              

424
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,700
      <i>Flintstones</i> are over.     

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
             Fred?              

426
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
            Freddie?            

427
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,100
          Oh, no, man!          

428
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,500
      Don't lock... shoot!      

429
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,800
    Come on, Freddie!           

430
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,300
    It was funny once!          

431
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
        All right.              

432
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,000
  Okay, Freddie, here I come.   

433
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,500
    Oh, no, no-no-no.           

434
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,200
          There we go.          

435
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
  Okay, Freddie, here I come.   

436
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,900
            Freddie!            

437
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,100
  Freddie, what are you doing   
        to Uncle Sammy?         

438
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,500
            Come on.            
  Bring the dog back, Freddie.  

439
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
    Woody, can I talk to you    
      for minute, please?       

440
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,100
        Sure, Ms. Howe.         

441
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,300
     Woody, I don't think things
     are working out with Kelly.

442
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Oh, well, that's my fault.      

443
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm afraid of commitment.       

444
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,000
              Woody, I mean here
                     at the bar.

445
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,800
             I mean, she's a big
             distraction to you;

446
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,200
         your work is suffering;

447
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,600
         and, and this bar fight
         is just the last straw.

448
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,600
            I'm afraid I'm gonna
             have to let her go.

449
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,400
         Well, I guess          
that was a tough decision       

450
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,900
for you to make, Ms. Howe.      

451
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,300
 Yeah, well, sometimes managers 
    have to learn how           

452
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,300
 to give bad news to employees. 

453
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,100
        So go fire              
    your girlfriend, Woody.     

454
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,500
Hey, I'm getting better at that.

455
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
                 I think I'll go
                get a facial.   

456
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,300
          I earned it.          

457
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,500
Wait. Whoa, wait a minute.      
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.   

458
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,800
Is it true?                     

459
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,300
Are you firing Kelly?           

460
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
Because I want you to know      
that she is the best thing      

461
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,400
that's ever happened            
to this bar!                    

462
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,200
  Since when did you ever care  
    what happened to Kelly?     

463
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,900
    Wait. Whoa, wait, whoa!     

464
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
        Something's happening   
                    to Kelly?   

465
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
              She's not leaving,
                         is she?

466
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes, as a matter of fact,       
            she is.             

467
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,400
I guess you're both going to    
have to learn to live with it.  

468
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,700
    She's here one day          
    and everybody loves her.    

469
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,600
      I'm here five years       
    and nobody gives a damn!    

470
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,100
    By the way, Norm.           
  why'd you want her to stay?   

471
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
     None of your business.     

472
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
  Why'd <i>you</i> want her to stay?   

473
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
     None of your business.     

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What did you want               
to talk about, Woody?           

475
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
          Well, Kelly, you don't
          really like this place

476
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
          all that much, do you?

477
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,300
Oh, sure I do.                  

478
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,900
I love this place.              

479
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,400
      It's keen.                

480
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,800
                        Oh, boy.

481
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,000
            Kelly, Cheers is not
             such a great place.

482
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,200
Well, what                      
do you mean, Woody?             

483
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,800
            Oh, I mean it's nice
                 on the surface,

484
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,800
                but when you get
            right down to it,   

485
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
             there's a dark side
                      to Cheers.

486
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,300
      Really?                   

487
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,700
        Aw, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly,
                you're so naive.

488
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,400
                 Nobody respects
                anybody here.   

489
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,600
                Oh, they're nice
                to your face,   

490
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,300
                     but as soon
             as you turn around,

491
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,500
    they're plotting some way   
              to get rid of you.

492
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,000
            And they never do   
        their own dirty work.   

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
                Nope. No, no.   
                They wouldn't   
                  stoop to that.

494
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,000
          They'd rather use some
          poor innocent farm boy

495
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
to carry out                    
their sinister deeds            

496
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
      while they go prancing off
                to get a facial!

497
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Well, I'm not doing it anymore! 

498
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
            I quit!             

499
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,300
    Then I quit, too!           

500
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
        Bye, everybody.         

501
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,000
 Oh, man, I knew that I should  
  not have had Woody fire her.  

502
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,600
                    When am I   
                    gonna learn?

503
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,200
     If you want something      
          done right,           

504
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,100
  you've gotta do it yourself.  

505
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,700
        (glasses break)         

506
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
 Be careful walking back here.  

507
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,300
        Ms. Howe.               

508
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,600
     Yes? What do you want?     

509
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, uh, listen,               
I've had a lot of time          

510
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,900
to think since I quit,          

511
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,300
and, uh, I've done              
a little growing up             

512
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
and, and, and if you haven't    
filled my old position yet,     

513
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,400
I'd like to...                  
                    Woody!      

514
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,700
I-I-I know that I'll have       
  to go back to starting wages  

515
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
and, and that                   
I'll lose my seniority.         
                        Woody...

516
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,700
    I-I-I know it'll take me    
    a few weeks to...           

517
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,500
             Woody, just shut up
        and get to work! God!   

518
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,900
Boy, they sure aren't very nice 
    to new employees.           

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,500
 Darling, do my eyes deceive me 

520
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,500
or is our little Frederick      
        actually asleep?        

521
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,300
                      Oh, he is!

522
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
          Where's Sam?          

523
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,300
    (banging outside)           

524
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,800
    Sam!                        

525
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,000
     Over here in the tree.     

526
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
  But I can still see the kid.  

527
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,600
             Whoo!              

528
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:41,226
