00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:05,405
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,492
I know, Dad, but still...

3
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:11,795
Well, whatever you think is best, Dad.

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,296
Right.

5
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,299
Bye, Dad.

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,167
That was my dad.

7
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,918
Really.

8
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:22,305
Yeah, he's threatening to make
me move back home to Indiana.

9
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,174
He's been talking to my Uncle Fergie.

10
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:25,642
The guy who was here last week?

11
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,010
I thought he had a great time.

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,261
Well, he did.

13
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,264
But all he told them about was
the two times he got mugged.

14
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,099
Oh, that was just bad luck. Yeah.

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,067
Woody, you've lived here two years.

16
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,068
How many times you been mugged?

17
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,352
Ten. But...

18
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,023
You know, that's including the
two times with Uncle Fergie.

19
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:41,574
Oh.

20
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,911
So now my parents are convinced
that Boston is a dangerous town

21
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,163
and all my friends are seedy lowlifes.

22
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:49,499
Well, surely they don't want
you to go back to Indiana

23
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:50,867
because we're a corrupting influence.

24
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,618
Well, who knows?

25
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,621
Somehow, they got the idea
that every guy in Boston

26
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,506
is some lonely, pathetic weirdo.

27
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,458
Look, is this or is this not

28
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,959
the spitting image of George Schultz?

29
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:05,131
So, uh, Woody, what
time does your bus leave?

30
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,471

(everyone groans)

47
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,358
Diane, do we really
have to do this again?

48
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:24,277
We all agreed that the best way

49
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,279
to persuade Woody's
parents to let him stay

50
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,781
was to show them how
decent and upstanding

51
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,649
his friends are, right?

52
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,568
(muttering agreement) Okay.

53
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,036
And what better way to show them

54
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,538
than by making a film
of his everyday life?

55
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:38,541
And who better to serve
as auteur than the person

56
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,543
who ruined the curve in
her film techniques class.

57
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:43,546
Hey, Diane, shoot the damn film.

58
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:47,050
Would you tell Fellini
"Shoot the damn film"?

59
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,552
Would you tell Antonioni
"Shoot the damn film"?

60
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,055
Would you tell Bergman
"Shoot the damn film"?

61
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,508
No, I'm telling you,
shoot the damn film.

62
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,896
Better yet, shoot the damn Diane.

63
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,264
Please.

64
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,765
A little more reverence

65
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,267
for the words I've written.

66
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,268
DIANE: Stick to the script.

67
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
And try to be spontaneous.

68
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,273
Okay.

69
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:15,778
Take 17, "Man-child in Beantown."

70
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,532
Action!

00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,919
"You know, when, the average
Joe like me gets off work,

72
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,921
"he needs to come to a place like this

73
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:28,091
where he can sort of unwind
with his surrogate family."

74
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,544
"Took the words right
out of my mouth, Norm.

75
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,546
"But it feels as if

76
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,299

"You're right.

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,852
Uh, what do you think
that would be, Carla?"

79
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:44,641
"Could it be that bucolic
ray of sunshine from Indiana?"

80
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,642
Stupid.

81
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,143
This whole thing is stupid, Diane!

People, people, work
with me! Work with me!

00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,485

00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,959
"The place seems so empty

89
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,961
without his smiling countenance."

us for some male bonding."

96
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,599
"Yeah, it sure is
refreshing to see a son

97
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,101
"being so considerate of his mother.

98
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,103
Isn't it, Carla?"

99
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,355
It's stupid!

100
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,077
"You know, my lovely and cherished..."

101
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,113
Fawn-like.

102
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,449
"...fawn-like bride-to-be,
Diane Chambers..."

103
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,869
You're right, Carla, this is stupid.

104
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,871
The whole thing is stupid!

105
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,374
I mean, why can't we
just use our own words?

106
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,759
Be ourselves here?

107
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,627
Fine, Mr. Smarty Pants.

108
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,513
You're such an expert,
you take the camera.

109
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,514
Go ahead. All right.

110
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,515
All right, I will.

111
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,517
Just don't come crying to me

112
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:04,520
when the whole
mise-en-scene deteriorates.

113
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:09,525
You'll find that film is an exacting art

114
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,027
requiring a lot more

115
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,397
than just knowing where
the "on" button is.

116
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,148
Good luck.

117
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,150
Yeah, well, we don't need any luck.

118
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,151
And we don't need you, either...

119
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,535
Cinema Puss.

120
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,708
Where is the "on" button on this?

121
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,000
SAM: Oh, good, good, good, good.

You're just in time
to see our masterpiece.

123
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,588
Should I alert Pauline Kael?

124
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,889
Well, if you want to,
but tell her to get

125
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,891
her butt in gear, we're about to start.

126
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:46,229
Cliffie, get the lights there.

127
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,097

128
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,402
SAM: This part was my idea.

129
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,770
Look at this.

130
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,072
DIANE: Startlingly original
use of the subjective camera.

131
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,573
SAM: No, not really.

132
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:01,577
They use it in all your
finer chain saw movies.

133
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,830
WOODY: Hi, Mom! Dad!

134
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,164
What a surprise!

135
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,667
I was hoping you'd get
to see where I worked.

136

Welcome to the best bar in Boston.

137
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,673
Pretty wholesome and
unseedy looking, huh?

138
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,676
And here are the best and
most uncorrupting friends

139
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,678

Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd!

141

WOODY: First, I'd like ya to
meet my boss and good friend,

142
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,519
Sam Malone.

143
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,020
Sam used to be a relief pitcher

144
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,522
for the Boston Red Sox.

145
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,974
Now he owns Cheers.

146
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,477
Hi! This is Sam's office.

147
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,479
And over there, that's Sam.

148
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,481
He's more than just a boss to me.

149
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,484
He's like the big brother I never had.

150
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,987
Well, except for Tom.

151
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,988
Hi, Woody.

152
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,408
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

153
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,410
Another good friend, Mr. Norm Peterson,

154
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
has been kind enough to
run the camera for us today.

155
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,335
So, uh, Sam, you're, you're
reading the Bible again huh?

156
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,337
Well, yeah, I...

157
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,840
didn't think I was gonna get caught.

158
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,225
Yes, I was just, uh, enjoying

159
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,646
St. Paul's, uh, Epistle
to the Galatians.

160
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,064
Boy, those Galatians.

161
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,517
When will they listen, huh?

162
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,521
Woody, uh, what's going on?

163
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,024
Oh, well, I have a
little dilemma here, Sam.

164
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,527
My father might call me back home

165
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,330
and, uh, if he does-- and
I sure hope he doesn't--

166
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,831
what am I gonna do with this?

167
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,333
(puppy whimpering)

168
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,336
I mean, after all, what kind of a place

169
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,339
is a small farm to raise a puppy?

170
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,343
I was hoping you could take him, Sam.

171
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,345
Well, gee, Woody, I don't have the room.

172
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,346
I guess you'll just have to put

173
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:47,850
the poor little fella to sleep.

174
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,852
Put this poor puppy to sleep

175
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,855
because I have to leave Boston?

176
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,858
Well, if that's what my father wants...

177
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,362
What a shame, Woody.

178
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,364
What kind of dog is it?

179
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:06,786
What's the difference? He's gonna die.

180
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,788
Well, maybe your daddy
will let you stay here

181
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,790
and take care of him.

182
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,159
I'd sure prefer that.

183
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,460
What about you, pooch?

184
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,412
Would you prefer that to dying?

185
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,921
Subtle tug at the old
heartstrings there, guys.

186
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,306
(crying): Boy, I'll say.

187
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,060
Hey, shut up, everybody,
you're missing my yard.

188
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,347
Hi! Welcome to our cookout.

189
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,349
Another chicken leg, Mr. Peterson?

190
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,351
Oh, well, nah... yeah!

191
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,852
What the hey, it looks pretty good

192
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
if I do say so myself.

193
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,606
(chuckles)

194
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,944
This is my co-worker
here, Carla Tortelli.

195
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,445
Hi.

196
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,447
FRASIER: What do we have here?

197
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,448
Uh, this is just the
sort of family type thing

198
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,950
we do here in Boston.

199
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,952
(Frasier yelling)

200
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,956
Hi.

201
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,458
Say something besides "hi."

202
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,960
Hello.

203
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,929
(jet airplane whines)

204
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:07,930
You hear that?

205
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,433
Well, uh, Carla lives
near the airport so...

206
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:15,438
(airplane roars)

207
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,441
...actually, sometimes,
it's hard to hear.

208
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:21,444
Why wasn't I invited?

209
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,945
You didn't miss much, Diane.

210
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,447
Carla's kids stole the beef

211
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,316
and then they stuck
Woody's shoes on the fire.

212
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,236
NORM (on film): More
smoked tongue, anyone?

213
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,238
FRASIER: Give me that!

214
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,740
(Frasier yelling)

215
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,544
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd. I'm...

216
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,547
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

217
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,050
I'm Cliff Clavin, a good pal of Woody's

218
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,553
and a proud member of
the U.S. Postal Service.

219
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,055
Come on along with me and I'll show you

220
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,558
the kind of work we do
routinely at the USPS.

221
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,510
CLIFF (on film): Morning, Woody.

222
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,394
Hi, Mr. Clavin.

223
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,897
Hi, Judy!

224
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,266
Well, let's see what
we got in the mail bag.

225
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,184
CLIFF: Well, look at this!

226
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,686
It's a letter all the way from Guam

227
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,688
to a man right here in Boston.

228
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,190
Wow! It's made it this
far, and it's up to me

229
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,076
to see that it gets where it's intended.

230
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,329
Woody, I could get in
big trouble for that.

231
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:14,830
Oh.

232
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,699
I'm only one link
in this chain--

233
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,702
a strong link, a vital link...

234
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,120
A missing link.

235
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,757
Come on in.

236
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,711
Pretty impressive, huh, Woody?

237
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,713
Sure is, Mr. Clavin.

238
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,215
Hey, just think, all these letters

239
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,218
traveling thousands of miles
over oceans and rough terrain,

240
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,555
right into the hands of
their, uh, intended addressees.

241
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,940
Hey, why thanks, Woody.

242
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,941
You did that pretty well.

243
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,442
Thanks.

244
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,945
Would, uh, would you like
to try one on your own?

245
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,197
Well, gee, Mr. Clavin, I'm
not a government employee.

246
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,565
(chuckling): Pretty good, Woody.

247
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,033
I was just testing him.

248
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,451
Smart boy.

249
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,904
Yeah, Woods, next time

250
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,706
you lick a stamp and
put it on an envelope,

251
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,207
drop it in that old mailbox,

252
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,209
be sure to give some thought to, uh,

253
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,628
the thousands of men and women
in the U.S. Postal Service

254
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,630
who work very hard, day after day,

255
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,501
to make sure that your
mail is delivered safely.

256
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,502
(chuckles)

257
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,503
You know, Woods,

258
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,505
you'd make a good
postal carrier yourself.

259
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
Yeah? You've got, uh, youth, stamina

260
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,009
and a friend down at the post office.

261
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
Oh, who's that, Mr. Clavin?

262
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,932
But then again, bartending
is a noble profession.

263
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,934
But, Woody, you know
there's nothing quite like

264
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,937
the pride a postman feels
on the swift completion

265
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,438
of his appointed rounds.

266
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,440
(doors opening)

267
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,752
WOODY: You don't have to
worry about me going hungry

268
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,587
if I stay here in Boston.

269
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:47,540
This town is famous for its
finer health food restaurants.

270
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,041
Hi.

271
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,544
And the best of them
all is the Hungry Heifer.

272
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,045
That's right, Woody.

273
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,014
WOODY: I found out about this place

274
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,517
through a guy who's helped me
plan my life here in Boston,

275
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,521
a good friend and my financial
advisor, Mr. Norm Peterson.

276
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,023
Hi.

277
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,524
Are you hungry?

278
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,530
CUSTOMERS: Norm!

279
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,036
Uh, nice place, huh?

280
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,538
Yeah, normally, for
this sort of ambiance,

281
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,991
you'd have to travel to Albuquerque.

282
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,493
Hi, Corinne.

283
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,494
Hi, honey.

284
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,496
Studying at the feet of the master?

285
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,497
Huh?

286
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,999
What can I get you, Norm?

287
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
The, uh, Feeding Frenzy Special for two.

288
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,006
How about you, honey?

289
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,009
Well, I think he was
ordering for both of us.

290
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,011
No. No.

291
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,015
Oh, well, give me just one.

292
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,517
Anything for you, Sam?

293
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,520
Smart move.

294
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,182
Oh,  Corinne, I think you
forgot the, uh, French fries.

295
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,185
Don't you wanna save room for dessert?

296
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,688
You're one step ahead of me.

297
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:30,276
They take care of you here.

298
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,196
Finally I want you to meet my
good friend, Dr. Frasier Crane.

299
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:37,700
Now, I know what you always
said about psychiatrists, Dad,

300
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,703
but, uh, he's not a crook
or a nut case or anything.

301
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,705
He's a pretty smart guy.

302
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,707
Well, here you go, Dr. Crane.

303
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,709
FRASIER: Thank you, Woody.

304
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:51,213
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd,

305
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,716
in Woody, you have raised

306
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,718
a young man of singular character,

307
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,721
not easily swayed by the
attitudes of those around him.

308
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,056
Trust him. Trust yourselves.

309
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:04,560
Let him do what he
wants to with his life.

310
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,563
Now, let me address
some of your reservations

311
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,482
about the psychiatric profession.

312
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,938
In this building, you see 18 floors

313
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,441
of highly trained,
dedicated professionals,

314
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,945
whose sole purpose is to heal the mind.

315
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,446
And, you know, I think my mentor...

316
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,417
Norm, Norm, could you run
that back for me, please?

317
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,419
FRASIER (on film): ...seek to find...

318
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,839
(audio playing backwards)

319
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,841
...you know, I think my mentor...

320
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,794
I've gotta tell Dr. Judd
to keep his windows closed

321
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,679
during his depression seminar.

322
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,849
Well, uh, what'd you think?

323
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:44,850
After seeing that, I think

324
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,218
we should all move to Indiana.

325
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,059
I don't know how you guys did it,

326
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,613
but you made me out as,
uh, some kind of a jerk.

327
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
Well, talk about movie magic, huh?

328
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,571
Maybe you're just too close
to the subject, huh, Cliff?

329
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,873
No, I thought he
looked like a jerk, too.

330
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,376
Yeah, you all look like jerks to me.

331
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,795
Oh...

332
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:13,796
May I say something?

333
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:14,797
Go ahead, go ahead.

334
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,298
Tell me how right you were.

335
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:17,800
Get it over with.

336
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,301
On the contrary,

337
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:22,221
I was about to say that I don't think

338
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,724
any of these people realize
what a fine job you did.

339
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,725
Oh, right.

340
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,227
No, I mean that.

341
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,728
What you have here

342
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,731
is the raw material
for a truly fine film.

343
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:33,732
Well, thank you.

344
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,235
The problem is entirely
with its structure.

345
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,236
It's too linear.

346
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,489
Yeah, that was gnawing at me, too.

347
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,274
We need to make a film that appeals

348
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,776
to the emotions, not the intellect.

349
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,277
If you'll allow me,

350
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,279
I can transform your film

351
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,282
into a shattering emotional experience.

352
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,784
What are you gonna do to it?

353
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,671
Oh, a snip here, a snip
there, nothing much.

354
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:02,494
(Wagner's "Ride of
the Valkyrie" playing)

355
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,823
DIANE: In a world gone mad,

356
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,424
where can a young man go?

357
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,526
Where? Where?

358
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,661
Tell me where?

359
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,499
ALL: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

360
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,735
WOODY: And here are the
best and most uncorrupting

361
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,971
friends a guy could hope to have.

362
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,773
First, I'd like you to meet my boss

363
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,907
and good friend, Sam Malone.

364
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,609
Sam used to be a relief pitcher

365
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,677
for the Boston Red Sox.

366
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,092
Uh, this is just the sort

367
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,762
of family-type thing
we do here in Boston.

368
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,564
ALL: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

369
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,266
Welcome to our cookout.

370
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,571
(mooing)

371
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,340
Another chicken leg, Mr. Peterson?

372
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,375
(clucking, squawking)

373
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,983
Be sure to give some thought to, uh,

374
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,651
the thousands of men
and women in uniform.

375
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,262
(bleating)

376
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:50,202
In Woody, you have raised a
young man of singular character,

377
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,038
not easily swayed by the
attitudes of those around him.

378
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,175
Trust him. Trust yourselves.

379
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,544
Let him do what he
wants to with his life.

380
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,312
DIANE: Shouldn't we all have the chance

381
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,348
to live our lives the way we choose?

382
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:08,153
Please, give us that chance
in the time we have left.

383
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,835
(explosion thundering)

384
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,828
(Diane sighs)

385
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,952
Well?

386
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,920
(muttering, murmuring)

387
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,672
NORM: Gee, uh, you know...

388
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:46,508
Oh, you're hurt because
I was the only one

389
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,010
who had a credit at the end.

390
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,012
(all disagreeing)

391
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,013
You keep the credits.

392
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,015
DIANE: Oh, thanks.

393
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:56,518
It's just that I felt
I transformed your film

394
00:18:56,518 --> 00:19:02,391
into a personal statement
that was pure Diane Chambers.

395
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,693
It was pure something.

396
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,196
I don't know, Miss Chambers.

397
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,198
Maybe we better not send
this film to my folks.

398
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,700
Oh, Woody, it's a fait accompli.

399
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,202
Was it ever.

400
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:17,206
No, I mean, I've already
sent a copy to your father.

401
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,991
For all we know, he may be

402
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,076
viewing it as we speak.

403
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,378
Oh, I think that's a mistake.

404
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:24,880
Why?

405
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,836
Well, your film, uh,
didn't have enough...

406
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,222
well, there, there was too much...

407
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:35,224
it needed a little, uh...

408
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:38,510
Yeah, and it stunk, too.

409
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,513
Thank you, Siskel and Ebert.

410
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,517
Take my word for it,
after Woody's father

411
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,437
sees this impassioned plea
for individual freedom,

412
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,440
there is no way he will
be able to order Woody

413
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,442
to leave here against his will.

414
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,327
Well, I guess this is good-bye, then.

415
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,333
I just can't believe
you're leaving us, Woody.

416
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,502
Are you sure my film

417
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,505
had no effect on your father?

418
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,006
Oh, come on, face it.

419
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,508
All that weird stuff

420
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,010
wouldn't mean anything
to a guy like Mr. Boyd.

421
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,512
Yeah. Besides, he thought

422
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,765
it was too derivative of Godard.

423
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,689
You sure you don't mind if
I take this picture, Sam?

424
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,692
No, I want you to have it.

425
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,694
While we're at it, Woody,

426
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,195
here.

427
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,197
Oh, one of your Elvis earrings.

428
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,699
Yeah.

429
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,652
Well, he was one of
a kind and so are you.

430
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,153
Oh...

431
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,155
Besides, the guy I went
out with last night,

432
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,157
he swallowed the other one.

433
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,660
Here.

434
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,161
I want you to have this.

435
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,163
It's a copy of Being and Nothingness.

436
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,166
My mother gave it to me in grade school.

437
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,670
Aw, thanks, Miss Chambers.

438
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,557
I don't think I've read this one.

439
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,893
Woody, uh...

440
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,395
a six-pack.

441
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,397
All the, uh, beer you've

442
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,898
poured me over the years, you know.

443
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,400
Thanks a lot, Mr. Peterson.

444
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,901
CLIFF: So, Woods, uh,

445
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,404
I've got a sheet of
commemorative stamps here

446
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,906
depicting, uh, all the U.S. Presidents,

447
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,908
uh, well, except nine.

448
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,411
That's great.

449
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,912
Thank you, Mr. Clavin.

450
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,419
See, I didn't know,

451
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,921
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

452
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,426
I could, uh, could I send you something?

453
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,928
Ah, that's fine, Dr. Crane.

454
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,436
It's... been an honor
knowing you, Woody.

455
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,438
You know, if somebody had told me,

456
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,307
I could've picked something up.

457
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:54,196
Uh... I gotta go.

458
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,697
I'll walk you to the car.

459
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,699
No, no, no, I... I
wanna remember you guys

460
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,067
the way you're standing.

461
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,826
Bye, Woody.

462
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,333
Well, hell, we don't have

463
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
to stand around here forever, do we?

464
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,086
Does anybody know his shirt size?

465
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,555
(phone ringing)

466
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:24,559
Come on, let me buy you all
a beer on the house, here.

467
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,560
No, none for me, Sammy.

468
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,561
CARLA: Hello, Cheers.

469
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,063
Beer's just gonna remind me of the kid.

470
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,564
It'll be quite some time

471
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,066
before I can even touch one again.

472
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:36,571
Well, that oughta do it, I guess.

473
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,574
Hey, hey, it's Woody's dad.

474
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,076
Get him! Get him!

475
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,577
Oh, oh!

476
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,079
Woody!

477
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,581
Woody, your father's on the phone.

478
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,087
Hey, guys, how you been?

479
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:55,841
Hello? Dad?

480
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:00,595
Really?

481
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,097
Oh, well, thank you. Thank you.

482
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,099
You don't know how happy this makes me.

483
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,601
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye!

484
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,603
Oh, I can stay!

485
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,608
Oh, Woody!

486
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,027
Yeah, after reflecting on my film,

487
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:20,399
he was finally moved
by its timeless message.

488
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,317
No, he tossed it in the thresher.

489
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,154
Well, what, what happened, Woody?

490
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,155
Someone sent him

491
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,157
a real simple note
that changed his mind.

492
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,542
What did it say?

493
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,044
It said, "Let your
son choose his own path

494
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,046
and it will always lead back to you."

495
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,048
Oh, how eloquent.

496
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,050
Yeah, but it wasn't signed.

497
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,552
Hey, come on, guys, fess up.

498
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,053
Who did it?

499
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,057
CLIFF: Oh, not me. No.

500
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,342
Don't look at me.

501
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,009
Carla?

502
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,895
Yeah, right.

503
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,397
I sure wish I knew who it
was, so I could thank them.

504
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,650
Don't mention it, kid.
