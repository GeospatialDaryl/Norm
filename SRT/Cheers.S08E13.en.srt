00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:11,292
Already?                       
 Boy, i can't believe it.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,379
Oh. Time plays             
     funny tricks on you        
     when you get older, woody.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,581
Yeah. You're not               
 a kid anymore, woodman.

6
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:18,266
Yes. Life rushes past you.

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,770
Months and years               
 seem to blend into             
 one indistinguishable blur,

8
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:25,339
while from behind you hear     
 the steady relentless beat

9
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:28,342
of the approaching wings       
 of grim-faced death.

10
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,081
I just meant my watch          
 was slow,

11
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:36,418

    i'm going to be able to

00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,062
hey, carla.

28
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,565
This is a black, black day.

29
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,332
Is school out already?

30
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:03,021
Worse. I got a letter       
    from the i.R.S.

31
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,939
Poor kid. Whoo!        
         What's it say?

32
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,006
I'm afraid to open it.

33
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:07,792
Hey, it may not be     
         that bad.

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,196
Sammy, i just said      
        it was from the i.R.S.,

35
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:15,166
The guys who got    
            al capone.

36
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,552
Well, carla, being afraid of   
 one of the most omnipotent     
 and powerful agencies

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,522
in the world is, of course,    
 quite understandable.

38
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,292
But the anxiety caused         
 by not dealing with            
 what's in that letter

39
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,545
is far worse than              
 the real situation.

40
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,915
Maybe you guys are right.

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,483
Nothing to fear                
 but fear itself.

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,518
I'm getting audited.           
 And that.

43
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,888
I'm getting audited.           
 Next stop, prison.

44
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,490
What am i going to do?

45
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,392
Probably make license plates.

46
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,312
Come on,                   
     audits happen every day.

47
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,414
I did thousands of them    
     when i was an accountant.

48
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,733
All you need to do is get   
    yourself a good accountant.

49
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,534
I don't have time for that.

50
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:52,337
Will you do it, norm?

51
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:54,955
Sorry, carla.          
         I'm a painter now.     
         Can't do it.

52
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:57,925
But if you do want your jail   
 cell painted navaho white,     
 i've got an--

53
00:02:57,993 --> 00:03:00,712
listen, i am desperate.     
    I'll pay you.

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,714
Ok. All right, i'll do it.

55
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,935
All right, fair enough. 
        I think what            
        you have to do is

56
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,003
bury the auditor           
     in paperwork, all right?

57
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,939
I want you to get       
        your hands on receipts.

58
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,373
Any receipt you have,   
        all right?

59
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,408
If you don't have them,    
     just make them up.

60
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:15,727
That's illegal.

61
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,545
All right. Forget it, then.

62
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:18,663
Oh, no.

63
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,633
No, not at all.                
 The kids will love it.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,967
We'll make it              
     a family project.

65
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,385
All right.

66
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,140
Ok, everybody get to work.

67
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,092
(Rebecca)                      
 woody, polish the bar rails.

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,228
Carla, scrape all the gum  
     from underneath            
     the table tops.

69
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,246
Why should i?

70
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,098
Because you put it there.

71
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,800
Come on, you guys.

72
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:41,469
My favorite                
     college professor's        
     coming to town.

73
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:43,354
I've invited her to dinner.

74
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:46,107
Oh, sam, straighten up      
    all those cocktail napkins.

75
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,342
I want all the jokes   
         pointing in            
         the same direction.

76
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,745
Whoa, whoa.                    
 Don't you think                
 you're going overboard

77
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,413
on these superficial           
 little things?

78
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,315
I mean,                        
 who's going to notice?

79
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:56,134
Sam, your hair's clumping up   
 a little bit on this side.

80
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,138
What? Oh, hey, guys, man,      
 you are supposed to tell me    
 when this happens.

81
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,027
Maybe i am getting             
 a little bit crazy.

82
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:07,662
It's just that                 
 i don't know why, uh,

83
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,997
somebody like              
     professor volkman

84
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,999
would come and see         
     somebody like me.

85
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:13,318
You see, i was sort of         
 a mess in school.

86
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,336
And i was always sucking up 
    to people, you know,

87
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,505
always trying              
     to please everybody.

88
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,340
Now, how have you changed?

89
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:21,843
I got my braces off.

90
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,113
Oh, i hope she likes my teeth. 
 Sam, what do you think?

91
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,047
They look pretty good to me.   
 Let's give them a taste.

92
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,483
Oh, ick.

93
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,885
Now, don't say          
        stupid things like that 
        when you're around her.

94
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:33,738
I have a great deal of respect 
 for alice anne volkman.

95
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,840
She's not only a remarkable 
    teacher and lecturer,

96
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,010
but also the author     
        of a book that's on     
        the best-sellers list.

97
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,129
Maybe you've heard of it,      
  <i>speak out and score.</i>

98
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,730
Oh, yeah. I read that book.

99
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,232
You read her book?

100
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,868
You read a book?

101
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,120
Well, to tell you the truth,   
 it was an accident.

102
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,972
I mean, who knew            
     <i>speak out and score</i>        
    <i>would be about business?</i>

103
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,459
I thought it was           
     about babes, you know.

104
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,095
You know, oddly enough,

105
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,964
that business stuff        
     really works on babes.

106
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,682
Well, sammy.               
     Maybe when she comes here,

107
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,652
you can ask her for        
     some business tips         
     on how to buy back cheers.

108
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,287
Oh, that's a good idea, man.

109
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,623
Sammy, you seem like shocked   
 that i had a good idea.

110
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,759
Oh, no.                        
 I--i didn't mean it that way.

111
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,561
Actually,                   
    i'm kind of surprised, too.

112
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,048
I think i'll celebrate     
     by having a beer.

113
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,833
Damn,                       
    there's another good idea.

114
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,687
Wow. I hope this isn't it  
     for the year.

115
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:27,242
Sam, i do not want you         
 talking to her about business  
 or babes or anything else.

116
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,177
I am trying to impress         
 the woman.

117
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,912
And you asked her      
         to meet you here?

118
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,414
[Exhales]           
         you asked her          
         to meet you period?

119
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:35,567
Honey, catch a train        
    to reality.

120
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,371

122
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,226
this piece is fresh.

123
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:48,413
Oh. Hey, i was looking     
     for that one.              
     Has some good chews left.

124
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,547
[Groans]

125
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,969
i'm alice volkman.             
 I'm looking for rebecca howe.

126
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:56,471
Oh, god. Ow!

127
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,773
Never mind.                
     I think i've found her.

128
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,276
Hi, alice,             
         it's good to see you.

129
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:06,196
Oh, sorry.                 
     I was just trying to make  
     this bar look good.

130
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,216
Here, have a seat.

131
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,717
Would you like                 
 something to drink?

132
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,535
Uh, some white wine.

133
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,287
Some white wine.

134
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:18,075
Well, rebecca,              
    it's great to see you.

135
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:20,612
And i might add,           
     you look sensational.

136
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:22,363
And you look terrific, too.

137
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,949
Might i say that           
     you--you have not changed  
     one iota since college.

138
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,002
I think you look better now,   
 and i didn't even              
 know you then.

139
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,987
Him i like.

140
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,606
Oh, sam, this is            
    alice anne volkman,         
    one of the finest,

141
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:36,844
most inspiring educators       
 and business minds             
 of our time.

142
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,880
Alice, this is sam,        
     a flunky.

143
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,532
A pleasure.            
             How do you do?

144
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:44,335
Hey, teach, carla lebec.

145
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:47,071
Listen, i got this,     
        uh, business problem.

146
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,257
I'm being audited           
    by the i.R.S.,

147
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,824
And i'm a little scared.

148
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,426
Oh, well, don't be.

149
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:56,297
The i.R.S. Auditors            
 aren't inherently              
 evil monsters and sadists.

150
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,650
They're people.            
     Just like you.

151
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:01,486
Boy, i'm in worse trouble      
 than i thought.

152
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:06,007
Alice, i am so honored     
     that you took time

153
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,276
out of your busy schedule   
    to spend some with me.

154
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:12,396
Well, i always like to         
 keep track of                  
 my former pupils, and, uh,

155
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,832
you were always            
     one of my favorites.

156
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,284
Thank you.

157
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,386
Uh, may i have some soda       
 in this, please?

158
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:20,955
Sure. So she was your, 
         uh, best student, huh?

159
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:21,973
Oh, god, no,

160
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,659
but she was                 
    one of my favorites.

161
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,861
Oh, sure, some of the kids  
    got better grades,

162
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,230
some were more creative,

163
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,265
and some you just knew      
    were going to make it,

164
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,700
but rebecca...

165
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,304
oh, gee, what was my point?

166
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,440
Oh, yes.

167
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:43,010
No one wanted success          
 more fiercely than becky howe.

168
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:44,829
You just can't beat            
 determination.

169
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,299
Even today,                    
 i hold rebecca up              
 as an example to my students.

170
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,984
You do?             
    You bet.

171
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,754
I tell them about              
 that little talk we had        
 at the end of the senior year.

172
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,057
Remember what  
                 i said to you?

173
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,443
That i flunked the final,      
 and have to repeat the course  
 in summer school

174
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,911
and get my diploma         
     in the mail?

175
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,898
Uh-huh. And you did it.

176
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,067
You held your head up  
         and persevered.

177
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:08,769
Anyone else would have had 
     a nervous breakdown.

178
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:11,205
I did have                  
    a nervous breakdown.

179
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,658
But you completed  
             the course,

180
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:15,125
as well as, uh,

181
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,495
several lovely                 
 macrame plant hangings.

182
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,716
And today                      
 she's our leader.

183
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:25,152
Listen,                        
 i hope this is not a bad time  
 to ask you this, but, uh,

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,188
i--i'm thinking about  
         buying back this bar.

185
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:32,226
I was wondering if you could   
 give me some advice on         
 how to save a lot of money.

186
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:33,527
No, sam, excuse me.

187
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,429
But alice and i                
 have reservations              
 up at melville's.

188
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,365
Maybe i could          
         just tag along.        
         I won't be in the way.

189
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,183
Come on,           
             i'll treat, huh?

190
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,735
Oh, well, if that's            
 your idea of saving money.     
 We do need to talk.

191
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,404
Come on, kids.                 
 It's on me.

192
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,373
Great.             
                 Oh, listen.

193
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,342
If you're going up         
     to melville's to have one  
     of their special dinners,

194
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,545
with all the appetizers 
        and the desserts        
        and everything,

195
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:52,280
would you bring back   
         something for me?

196
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:54,549
Sure. What do you want? 
 Your receipt.

197
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:00,655
<i>[Music playing]</i>

198
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:02,523
you know,                      
 i am really impressed          
 you read my book.

199
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:03,641
Mmm, well...

200
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,510
i read it too.         
         In hardcover.

201
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,197
You should have waited         
 for the paperback.             
 Saved a few bucks.

202
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,466
Oh, i didn't buy it.    
        I checked it out        
        at the library.

203
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,801
Ah, there go those royalties.

204
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,106
You know what i love       
     about your book is the way

205
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,741
you lay out                    
 that whole philosophy thing,

206
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,995
dare it, decide it, do it.

207
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,329
That's just so memorable.

208
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,131
Well,                          
 that was no accident.

209
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,934
The common denominator         
 is commitment.

210
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,220
Plus they all begin with d's.

211
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:35,339
Yeah, well,                    
 the key is decisiveness.

212
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:36,707
[Sam grunts]

213
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,410
you know, that was always      
 rebecca's failing in school.

214
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,846
She could never take a stand.  
 She always had to ask

215
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,682
what somebody else thought     
 before she knew                
 what she thought.

216
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,916
But i've changed since then.

217
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,384
Have you made a decision,  
     ma'am?

218
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:50,922
The rest of your party 
         are halfway through    
         their salads.

219
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,373
Is the swordfish fresh?

220
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,359
It was when            
         you started ordering.

221
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:02,066
All right,                  
    all right, all right,       
    i know what i want now.

222
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,817
Not chicken.

223
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,904
She'll have the spinach salad, 
 lamb chops in mint jelly,

224
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:09,123
and the broiled new potatoes.

225
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,324
Oh, that sounds good.

226
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,359
How'd you come up with     
     such a great combo?

227
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,012
It's the number 2.

228
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,352
What's this?

229
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,972
It's our dessert menu.      
    I thought you might like to 
    hit the ground running.

230
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:32,029
Alice, i have           
        something for you.

231
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,898
It's something             
     very special,

232
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,052
and it's something that        
 i have waited a very long time 
 to give you.

233
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:46,377
This is your term paper        
 from january, 1977.

234
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,963
Yeah. I bet you thought that   
 i'd stopped working on it.

235
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,268
Oh, i'm afraid                 
 i'm going to have to

236
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:57,588
knock you down a half a grade  
 for being tardy.

237
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:00,408
It's just that i--i--i--       
 wanted it off my conscience.   
 You know?

238
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,276
It's the first "f" i ever got.

239
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:04,545
But then it led to             
 all those other f's, so i...

240
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,947
i wanted to feel           
     a sense of completion.

241
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:10,584
Granted, it--t's a tad bit 
     dated in places.

242
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:13,187
"Jimmy carter,                 
 the 3-term president."

243
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,858
It could still happen.

244
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,809
He was a physicist,     
        did you know that?

245
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:21,112
Yes. Page 2.

246
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,214
Well, i'll look forward        
 to reading it.

247
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,117
You had a question about       
 how to buy cheers?

248
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,086
Yes, i do.

249
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,754
What's the question?

250
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:33,725
How do i buy cheers?

251
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,760
Sam, forget it.                
 It's just a pipe dream.        
 It's never going to happen.

252
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,663
Oh, rebecca,                   
 nothing's impossible.

253
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,948
Nothing's impossible.          
 If you put your mind to it,    
 you can do it.

254
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,300
We have faith in you.

255
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,186
Rebecca, honey, relax.

256
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,854
You don't have to impress me.  
 You never did.

257
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,842
I never did                
     have to impress you,

258
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,877
or i never did impress you?

259
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,196
Hmm, that's a pick 'em.

260
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,367
(Woody)    
                     miss howe?

261
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,852
Phone for you downstairs.  
     It's robin colcord.

262
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,570
The robin colcord?

263
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:04,938
Oh, i don't know.

264
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,908
If you mean                 
    the fabulously handsome,

265
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:11,745
wealthy multimillionaire,      
 yes, that's him.

266
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,748
Woody, would you please    
     tell robin colcord

267
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:18,202
that i will call him back      
 at my convenience.

268
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,970
Ms. Howe,          
             i know you told me 
             to come up here

269
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:23,090
and pretend robin colcord's 
    on the phone for you.       
    But he really is.

270
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,192
And you kept him on hold       
 all this time?

271
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,545
Oh, why didn't you tell me?    
 Move it!

272
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:29,813
What about your meal?

273
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,432
Woody, you handle it.

274
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,805
Yeah, i think i'm going to 
     need more mint jelly

275
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,307
and lots of ketchup.

276
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,315
[People chattering]

277
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:51,852
rebecca?

278
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,337
You ok?

279
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,139
You never came back            
 last night.

280
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,674
Oh, i am sorry, alice,     
     but you know how it is     
     when you are on the phone

281
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,343
with someone like  
             robin colcord.

282
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,745
Now, first we were         
     conference calling,        
     then telstarring and then

283
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:03,848
bouncing satellites all over   
 the solar system.

284
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,316
(Carla)                     
    oh, rebecca, wait a minute.

285
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,835
You, you got a fax 
             from robin.

286
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:12,506
Uh, "sorry i left you      
     on hold last night

287
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,007
"and never got back to you.

288
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:17,077
But something came up,     
     and i had to fly           
     to stuttgart."

289
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:19,780
All right,         
             thank you, carla.

290
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:22,182
Well, i guess      
             i can hang up now.

291
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:27,888
You were on hold               
 since last night?

292
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,457
Ah, don't be ridiculous

293
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:31,024
i called him again 
             this morning.

294
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,261
I've only been on hold 
         a couple of hours.

295
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:37,114
So, uh, i apologize 
            for leaving you     
            up at melville's.

296
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,599
Oh, no problem.

297
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,918
Can i get you a cup of coffee? 
    Fine.

298
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,354
Sam was nice enough to         
 drive me back to the hotel.

299
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:45,072
Good.      
     Yeah.

300
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,808
So i asked him                 
 into the bar downstairs

301
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,561
to discuss his plans           
 to buy back cheers.

302
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,446
You know,              
         you are so terrific.

303
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:55,115
It is no wonder that   
         i have idolized you    
         all these years.

304
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,284
[Laughs]

305
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,685
so after drinks,

306
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,219
we moved the conversation      
 up to my room,

307
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,722
had a night cap,               
 talked a little more, did it,

308
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,827
and this morning           
     had quite a nice           
     continental breakfast.

309
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:10,114
So the hotel offers    
         a free continental     
         breakfast whenever...

310
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,633
"did it"?

311
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,770
You slept with sam malone?

312
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,304
Oh, is that his last name?

313
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:18,305
[Gasps]

314
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,464
well, i'd love                 
 to stay here and chat,

315
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,600
but, uh, i've got to           
 get back to the hotel,

316
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,704
if i'm going to get a nap      
 before my seminar tonight.

317
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,056
Don't give away                
 all your dental secrets.

318
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:38,925
Hey, prof.                  
 Hi, sam.

319
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:40,627
How are you doing?         
 Fine. Yourself?

320
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:42,596
Pretty good.                
    Think we're gonna get snow?

321
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:45,683
No, it's too cold.             
            Yeah. Probably not. 
            Bye-bye.

322
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,321
Sam,

323
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,058
may i speak with you           
 over here privately, a second?

324
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,993
Sure.

325
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,894
Think we'll get any snow?

326
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:01,531
You germ.

327
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,500
What?                      
                 You insect.

328
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:07,321
I cannot believe    
            you slept with      
            alice anne volkman.

329
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,706
And how could you  
             take advantage of

330
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,424
a lonely, older woman  
         like that?

331
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,926
Oh, sweetheart,                
 when the lights go out,

332
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:15,663
everybody's the same age,      
 and nobody's lonely.

333
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,547
[Sighing]

334
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:21,552
i cannot believe you made,     
 my mentor, my idol, just       
 another notch on your bedpost.

335
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,687
Hey, hey. That's not true.

336
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,539
I don't have a bedpost.

337
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:29,776
Which you'd know if you'd  
     ever had the decency       
     to come to my bedroom.

338
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,730
God, this is my fault.

339
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,865
I never should have        
     brought her here.

340
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,735
All i ever wanted to do     
    was impress the woman.

341
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,503
Well, i got             
        some good news for you.

342
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,872
First thing she said   
         after she put out      
         her cigarette was,

343
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:44,141
"hey, sam,                 
     you're very impressive."

344
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,328
How can you be so insensitive? 
                 What?

345
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,980
Look, she's not another one    
 of your dumb bimbos!

346
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,983
She doesn't just               
 take sex lightly, you know.

347
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,518
What are you going to do       
 when she wants to              
 see you again?

348
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,602
See? Oh, please.

349
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,521
Yes,                           
 she's a very classy woman.

350
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,207
She probably thinks            
 there's some kind of           
 commitment here.

351
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,842
I don't-- i don't think so. 
     Sam, trust me.

352
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:05,879
Well...

353
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,549
you know her       
             better than i do.

354
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:11,418
I certainly don't want         
 any misunderstanding here.     
 I'll give her a call.

355
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:15,055
Oh, yeah, right.           
     Some faceless, anonymous,  
     blow-off phone call

356
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:17,775
that you have made         
     a thousand times before.

357
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:20,043
That's why i suggested it.

358
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:22,796
I'll tell you what you are 
     going to do, young man.

359
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:24,898
You are going to march over 
    to that hotel right now,

360
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:26,867
and you are going to   
         straighten things out.

361
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,669
Hey, first of all,             
 i only march                   
 when my mom tells me,

362
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,590
and, second,                   
 if i go over there,            
 i'm still on the clock.

363
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,543
That's another one             
 of those business things       
 we discussed,

364
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:37,978
in the shower.

365
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,096
[Exclaims]

366
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:45,886
boy, it's getting scary     
    around here.

367
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:48,004
Why do you      
                say that, wood?

368
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:51,058
Well, i mean,                  
 if carla's getting audited,    
 can i be far behind?

369
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,476
[Chuckles]

370
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,512
come on, woody,            
     from what you make,        
     and the way you handle it,

371
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,132
if you made $1 less,       
     i do believe you'd qualify 
     for food stamps.

372
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,517
All right.                     
 Then i'm sitting pretty.

373
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,238
All right.

374
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:08,525
Ok, cliff,              
        i treated you to dinner 
        at the ritz-carlton

375
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:12,012
on august 16th of last year 
    to discuss career matters.

376
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,463
Hold on. You know, uh,

377
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,332
i'd like to find out           
 a little bit more              
 about this scam

378
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
before i lend                  
 my good name to it.

379
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:20,187
Now, what kind of, uh,         
 career matters did we discuss?

380
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,839
Your career in          
        the vienna boys' choir.

381
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:27,294
Oh, yeah. That was             
 a tasty little dinner,         
 wasn't it?

382
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:28,478
4 star.

383
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,731
Ok, norm, look, um,

384
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,268
if anybody asks,           
     on november 25th,

385
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,503
i bought you a mercedes        
 for business reasons.

386
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,771
Right, ok, good.

387
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,739
It's got one of                
 those car phones, right?       
         Yeah.

388
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:42,075
Just don't tell vera    
        the number.

389
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,495
Hey, carla. I don't get it.    
 You buy mr. Clayton dinner,

390
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,096
you buy mr. Peterson           
 a new car.

391
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:48,131
What about me?                 
 I'm your friend.

392
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,800
Ok, woody, um,

393
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,069
on march 15th,         
         i took you to hawaii.

394
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,039
Sure, the rainy season.

395
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:02,029
Is there                    
    a mrs. Carla lebec here?

396
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,080
Who wants to know?

397
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,466
I am donald zajac,             
 internal revenue services.

398
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,284
I'm the widow lebec.

399
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:11,554
Mrs. Lebec,                    
 do you own this bar?

400
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:12,406
Get out of here.

401
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,174
Do i look like     
             i own this bar?

402
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:16,076
Frankly, no.

403
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:19,129
But someone with an income     
 of $1.3 million obviously      
 isn't a cocktail waitress.

404
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,931
Don, is that you?

405
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,834
Hey, peterson,                 
 how you doing?                 
 All right, buddy.

406
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,169
Whoa.

407
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,687
Hey, you think carla           
 owns this place?

408
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:29,372
That's some kind of            
 major snafu, pal.

409
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,042
What do you got, one of those  
 american-made computers?

410
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:34,327
This guy.

411
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,096
Come on.                    
 I guess you're right, norman.

412
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:38,832
If she made                    
 that kind of money,            
 why would she dress like this?

413
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,568
[Laughing]

414
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:41,935
these are my good clothes.

415
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,770
[All laughing]

416
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:45,706
i even got my hair done.

417
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,562
The thought that carla could   
 ever pull down a million bucks

418
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,314
is absolutely nuts.

419
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,150
You know, all the tips         
 she's ever made in her life    
 wouldn't amount to that,

420
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,970
even if she did report 'em,    
 you know what i mean?

421
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,057
Well, carry on.

422
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:09,263
Uh, i think you'd better       
 come with me, mrs. Lebec,

423
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,215
and, uh,                       
 get your receipts.

424
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,283
And they all                   
 better be genuine.

425
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,589
I'm going to get you, norm.

426
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,427
I don't care if they put me    
 in solitary confinement

427
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,029
with nothing but       
         bread and water.

428
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:28,531
I'll survive,              
     because i got a mission,

429
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,701
get norm peterson!

430
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,770
You remember,                  
 i got friends on the outside!

431
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,023
By the way, carla, uh,     
     no charge.

432
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:43,881
Rebecca, honey.

433
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,249
[Door shuts]

434
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,619
you didn't come to my seminar. 
 I was surprised.

435
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,537
Is something going on?

436
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,339
I just couldn't face you,  
     alice.

437
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,142
Not with all                   
 you've been through,           
 and i knew it was my fault.

438
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,660
What are you                   
 talking about?

439
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,595
Sam.               
     Malone, right?

440
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,615
Right.

441
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,950
I sent him over to your hotel  
 to straighten things out.

442
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:05,585
Did you two            
         clear the air?

443
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,687
Yes we did.                    
 And then we steamed it         
 up again.

444
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,742
I don't get this.

445
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,312
Why, y-you,                    
 you are alice anne volkman,    
 my mentor.

446
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:18,048
He is sam malone.

447
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,983
He's nothing.                  
 He's a bartender.

448
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,902
Listen, honey,         
         you should do so well  
         at my age.

449
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,005
Come to think of it,    
        you should do so well   
        at your age.

450
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,158
You're probably right.

451
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,893
I mean,                        
 you always did know best.

452
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,629
B-but then again, i mean,      
 you went to bed with sam,      
 so that makes...

453
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:35,215
oh, i'm just so confused.

454
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:36,850
Rebecca, slow down.

455
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,185
Take a deep breath.

456
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,353
[Inhaling]

457
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,904
[exhaling]      
 close your eyes,

458
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:42,973
and get a handle           
     on your feelings.

459
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,608
All right.

460
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,177
On one hand,                   
 i'm a little bit disappointed  
 with you

461
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,912
for what you have done.

462
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,415
But on the other hand,         
 i mean, i think,               
 "well, hell, it's your life."

463
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,683
I mean,                    
     you know what you want--   
     rebecca, choose.

464
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,001
You're a slut!

465
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:59,272
Very good.

466
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,525
That's the first time          
 i've ever heard you            
 take a stand

467
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,728
without worrying about         
 offending someone.

468
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:08,465
You're a soulless pig      
     of a rotten slut! Slut!

469
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,668
Now i'm offended.

470
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,319
I'm sorry.          
            I take it all back.

471
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:16,840
Oh, don't, don't do that.      
 I was just beginning to        
 respect you.

472
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,625
Oh. Slut.

473
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:23,897
Now you're just                
 trying to kiss up.

474
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,634
Oh, by the way,                
 i read your, uh, paper         
 on president carter.

475
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:29,586
I liked it very much.

476
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,572
[Knocking on door]         
     you did? Thank you.

477
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,339
In fact, i gave you an "a."

478
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,358
Thank you.

479
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,959
Hey, prof.

480
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,728
I'm giving you an a-plus.

481
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,600
Thank you.

482
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:45,568
Hey, have a nice, safe flight.

483
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,170
See you spring break.

484
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:52,643
It's an inside joke.

485
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,278
Last night we broke            
 a few springs.

486
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,620
Sam, i have this overwhelming  
 feeling of liberation.

487
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,788
Yeah?

488
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:07,857
No, i--i--i mean,              
 i just told my mentor

489
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,492
she was a slut.

490
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,461
Now, i don't care              
 what other people think.

491
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,898
I mean,                        
 i know what's important now    
 is what i think.

492
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,267
And i know i'm as smart 
        as anyone else.

493
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:18,452
You're a lot smarter           
 than i am.

494
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,121
I didn't know he was        
    a peanut farmer that long.

495
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:27,227
Man. This has been a hell  
     of a couple of days,       
     hasn't it?

496
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,263
[Whoops]

497
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,064
you know, but everything   
     turned out for the best    
     for everybody.

498
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:34,134
You know, i mean, i--   
        i learned a really good 
        lesson about life.

499
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,587
And, um, i think alice had 
     a good time with, uh,

500
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,789
you know, stuff you and she 
    were doing all the time.

501
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,091
And, um...

502
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,078
and then of course you got 
     all that great business    
     information from her!

503
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,965
Yeah, yeah, actually,   
        i never did get         
        any advice from her.

504
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,200
She kept saying            
     she was going to           
     give it to me,

505
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:53,136
but then we ended up in bed.

506
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,955
Afterwards she said            
 she was gonna give it to me    
 the next day,

507
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:57,424
but we ended up in bed again.

508
00:22:57,492 --> 00:23:00,927
You know, she never really     
 told me anything.

509
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:03,930
Now she's gone.

510
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,365
Well,

511
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,285
it's still been                
 a hell of a couple of days.

512
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,370
[Door shuts]

513
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:11,504
