       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

12
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:25,932
 Sometimes you want to go where
  everybody knows your name    

13
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:29,869
       And they're always

14
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:33,389
         You want to be

    knows your name.           

19
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,878
    So, did you get a chance    
     to see Carla's babies?     

20
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:12,962
Oh, we sure did.                

21
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:15,164
There are two of the cutest     
little guys you've ever seen.   

22
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,699
Ah, who do they look like,      
        Carla or Eddie?         

23
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:18,334
            Well, they're twins.

24
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,352
            They kind of look   
            like each other.    

25
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,424
          What's this?          
        "Carla's Tips."         

26
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,842
Yeah, it was Carla's idea.      

27
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:29,178
She does some of her best       
    thinking in labor.          

28
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:30,295
      This is ridiculous.       

29
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,932
How does she expect to be tipped
    if she's not even here?     

30
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,267
Well, actually,                 
she's doing a lot better        
than she usually does.          

31
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,771
         Hello, Samuel.         
                            Hey.

32
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,539
  Well, pardon my appearance,   
        everybody.              

33
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,790
         We always do.          

34
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:45,611
Sorry. I was covering for Carla.

35
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,163
     Oh, hey, you're doing      
          a fine job.           

36
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:49,415
The reason why I look like      
     I've been up all night     

37
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,583
    is because, well,           
     I've been up all night     

38
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,818
reading that little opus.       

39
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:54,753
              All right,        
               <i>Lust for Justice.</i>

40
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:56,288
            Yeah, Vera talked me
            into reading this.  

41
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,456
Oh, is she a fan?               

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,759
            No, no. When Vera's 
            talking, I'll read  
            just about anything.

43
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,561
Yeah. I almost                  
ruptured a disc

Book of the Month club copies   

45
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:06,265
and I decided to see            
what all the hooha was about.   

46
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,299
                Yeah, two thumbs
                up, right?      

47
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:08,900

Finest piece of trash

    of salacious mind candy.    

50
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:18,176

        600 pages long.         

51
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,412
    Who could imagine           
he'd know this many words?      

52
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,732
     Yeah, well I checked.      
  He uses a lot of them twice.

            Yeah, well, Frasier,

54
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:27,219
you want to                     
borrow it then?                 

55
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,238
     No way you'll find me      
          reading it.           

56
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:30,906
  Just look at these reviews.   

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,207

        Oh, yeah, she is.       
        Miss Howe, Mr. Drake.   

62
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,106
        Mr. Drake?              

63
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:48,841
    I wonder what he's          
         calling about.         

64
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,676
        Woody, how did he sound?

65
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,145
 Happy, mad, pleasant, annoyed? 

66
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:54,463
Well, he sounds                 

67
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,464
         kind of weird.         

68
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:57,632
 Like an old woman with a lisp  
and a thick German accent.      

69
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,519
  Woody, that's his secretary.  

70
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,821
Oh, well, then she sounded      
         pretty happy.          

71
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:09,261
Hey, Anthony, Annie, what's up? 

72
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:13,065
      Sam, I'm swallowing       
    my Tortelli pride           

73
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,333
to ask if                       

74
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,468
I might borrow five bucks.      

75
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:18,537
That was very difficult         
for him.                        

76
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:19,321
Is it okay?                     

77
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:21,740
    I want to get a present     
for my mom and the twins.       

78
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:22,842
                        Sure.   

79
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,043
What are you going to get them? 

80
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,127
          Five bucks.           

81
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,779
    She'll like that.           

82
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:28,747
              Thanks, Sam.      

83
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:30,916
  Hey, I don't know when I'll be
  able to pay you back.         

84
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,051
Job market's                    
been really bad lately.         

85
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,921
          I haven't been able to
          find a job anywhere.  

86
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:38,123
  Actually, we have an opening  
    for a temporary waitress    

87
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,325
      to sub for your mom.      
    What do you think?          

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,528
            Ah, I don't want    
            to be a waitress.   

89
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,680
 No, I was thinking about her.  

90
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,698
             No, I don't want my
             wife to work.      

91
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,667
I could do it if I want to.     

92
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,736
                      Nuh-uh.   
Nuh-huh.

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,405
Nuh-uh.                         
Nuh-huh.

                    Nuh-uh.     

95
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,073
      W-Why don't you two       
         talk about it.         

96
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:56,375
Of course we will.              

97
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,211
Communication is                
the cornerstone of our marriage.

                    Nuh-uh.     
Nuh-huh.                        

99
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:07,219
    Well, well, well.           
          Hey, Normie,          

100
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,821
look who's developed            
a lust for justice.             

101
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,422
             Yeah.              

102
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,624
        Do you mind?            
        Lorenzo is hemorrhaging.

103
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,026
          Oh, he dies.          

104
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,412
                  Don't tell me.
                  Don't tell me.

105
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,613
    Yeah, yeah, that's true.    

106
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,781
We don't want to spoil the part 
  where Monica first comes in.  

107
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:21,884
Were you shocked or what when   
she turned out to be a man?     

108
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:22,718
CLIFF:                          
Oh, no, no, I saw...            

109
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:24,470
          I wish I was         
    in the land of cotton      

110
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:25,838
     Old times there           
      are not forgotten        

111
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:28,306
     Look away, look away,     
         look away...          

112
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:31,209
You know, sometimes I like      
 to play little guessing games. 

113
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,978
Do you like to play             
little guessing games, guys?    

114
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,113
         ( <i>all agree</i> )

00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:35,964
             Let's play a little
             guessing game.     

116
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:39,902
I just spoke to Mr. Drake       
  and he suggested that I hire  

117
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:42,872
     a young girl he knows      
      to cover for Carla.       

118
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:46,108
Now, why do you suppose a busy, 
  important man like Mr. Drake  

119
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:47,776
 would take time out of his day 

120
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:51,246
    to get a simple cocktail    
        waitress a job?         

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,865

                Uh, she's, uh...
Norm.                           

122
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,033
 She's a friend of the family.  

123
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:55,768
        Possible.

  He's, uh, paying off a debt.  

125
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,920
          I like that.          

126
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:58,804
         He feels sorry for her.

127
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,306
He does have a soft heart.      

128
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,440
Maybe she's                     
sleeping with him.              

129
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,625
  Of course that little tramp   
     is sleeping with him!      

130
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,296
                    Do you think
                    I'm stupid? 

131
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,664
        Is this still part of   
        the guessing game?      

132
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:09,765
No, no, no.                     

133
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,922
This is just too perfect.       

134
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:21,127
 Evan found a nice little bowl  
 for his goldfish to swim in.   

135
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:24,946
Safe, out of the reach of       
  the other executive sharks.   

136
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:26,365
      Obviously, he forgot about

137
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,483
     the Great White Sammy.     

138
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,302
        ( <i>all snicker</i> )         

139
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,272
             Well, we've reached
             a compromise, Sam. 

140
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:34,673
        I'm taking the relief   
        waitress job.           

141
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:35,807
SAM:                            
Great.                          

142
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:36,958
          What's the compromise?

143
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,211
I'm letting her.                

144
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,946
              Wait a minute.    

145
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,714
I am in charge around here      

146
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,383
and it is my responsibility     
to hire people,                 

147
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:47,552
and I have just be informed     
that I am hiring someone else.  

148
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,090
         They're going through  
         a tough time right now.

149
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,693
         Why don't you let Annie
         work just for tips?    

150
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,061
             Tips?              
                !               
                        Yeah.   

151
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:58,997
    If I'm gonna work here,     
    I demand a set salary,      

152
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,866
plus tips, plus                 

153
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,536
    two coffee breaks,          
    plus weekends off.          

154
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,271
That is completely              
out of the question.            

155
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:08,190
Okay, then I demand             
that tip thing.                 

156
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,025
It's a deal.                    

157
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:19,635
I need a Scotch, rocks,         
two white wines and a draft.    

158
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,103
                 Okeydokey.     

159
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:24,056
Come on, corn cob. <i>Arriba.</i>      

160
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,494
        Boy, I tell ya,         
        Annie's getting to be   
        a real pro, huh?        

161
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,147
Yeah, she's sure rattling off   
those drink orders, huh?        

162
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,381
            That's nothing.     
            How about the way   

163
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,650
        she puts me in my place?

164
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,121
      Can you believe it?       

165
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:43,725
  Her first day on the job and  
  Evan's little tart is late.   

166
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,461
              That's because she
              knows I can't do  
              anything about it 

167
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:47,646
        because her lover boy   
        is the big boss.        

168
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,299
              Isn't she just    
              the queen of gall?

169
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,419
 Oh, no, that was Charlemagne's 
         wife, I think.         

170
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,855
        Well, you know,         
    if memory serves,           

171
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,357
  I think her name was Cathy.   

172
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:00,826
Listen, have you ever thought   

173
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,244
that you're reading             
this whole thing wrong?         

174
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,830
That maybe she's just           
a four-eyed little geek         

175
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,732
that Evan Drake                 
is trying to help out?          

176
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,584
     Right. And Cliff is leaving
     his brain to science.      

177
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:13,371
 I guess, you're still covering 
        for Carla, huh?         

178
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,190
          Guess again.          

179
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:18,377
        Okay, uh, here's        
      another possibility.      

180
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,761
                 Instead of     
                 firing someone,

181
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:22,097
            you send them to    
            the worst job in    
            the organization.   

182
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:24,116
     Usually the poor schlep    
     just gets fed up and quits.

183
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:27,669
         They've tried that     
         on me a bunch of times.

184
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,154
             Works like a charm.

185
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,141
You know,                       
you might be right.             

186
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,426
She's probably just some        
pathetic little dishrag         

187
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,646
whose last great hope           
is working here at Cheers.      

188
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:40,432
I got to stop                   
jumping to conclusions.         

189
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,736
 Excuse me. Is Miss Howe here?  

190
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,588
    Mr. Drake sent me.          

191
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:49,341
Oh, you must be the slut.       

192
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:52,644
        Excuse me?              

193
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,779
    Slot. You're here           
    to fill the slot.           

194
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,065
              Welcome to Cheers.

195
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:58,934
    Why don't you just          
    follow me in to my office   

196
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:00,802
              and we'll fill out
              your W-4 form.    

197
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:01,754
             Great.             

198
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:04,940
  And I'll need a phone number  
    and a job history,          

199
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,224
        and a number we can call

200
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:09,294
in case you meet with some      
 horrible disfiguring accident. 

201
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:12,631
Sam?                            

202
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:14,066
             What?              

203
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,287
Could I ask your opinion as     
a passionate macho stud horse?  

204
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,290
Sure. I may have to stamp out   
the answer with my foot,        

205
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,225
but go ahead.                   

206
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,646
        Well, it's bad enough   
        that Anthony's lost     
        all his ambition        

207
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,047
            and can't get a job.
Right.                          

208
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,783
        But ever since I        
        started working here,   

209
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,084
 he's become insanely jealous.  

210
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,137
Why am I late?                  
When am I coming home?          

211
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:37,806
Why am I dressed                
like such an ultra-fox?         

212
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:41,143
I mean, if it weren't for       
the six times a day we make love

213
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:43,328
he'd be no fun at all.          

214
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:46,115
              Six?              

215
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,266
                        Whoo!   

216
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,652
    Can't think of anything     
 that I can do six times a day. 

217
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:54,957
  Hit me again. Will you, Sam?  

218
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:58,410
            Listen, it's kind of
            tough on a husband, 

219
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,962
      you know, to have his wife
      supporting him.           

220
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,597
             It's a...          
             It's a pride thing.

221
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,698
It is a pride thing, Sam.       

222
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:07,386
 I remember once when I was out 
of work, Vera had to support us.

223
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,956
 I tell ya, the day that woman  
 left to deliver phone books... 

224
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:16,645
  The proudest day of my life,  
        actually.               

225
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,129
                What do you want
                me to do?       

226
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:19,331
                  You want me to
                  talk to him?  

227
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,533
Would you, Sam?                 
Thanks.                         
                         Yeah.  

228
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:23,168
        Yeah, you're welcome.   

229
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:24,403
        Hey, I saw that!        

230
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,393
Anthony! I can't believe        
you're spying on me.            

231
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:34,029
        Suddenly,               
    everything makes sense.     

232
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:36,231
          You're taller than me.

233
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,468
      You have a Corvette       
     instead of a bus pass.     

234
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,838
    And your hair does          
that cool blow-dry thing.       

235
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,424
  And now you've got my wife.   

236
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,560
  Well, aren't you gonna stay   
    and fight for me?           

237
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:49,761
        What's the use?         

238
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:50,328
                Hey, Anthony,   

239
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,713
          come on, now, don't...

240
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:54,549
Have you ever had to defend     
Vera's honor?                   

241
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,018
        Well, no, not per se.   

242
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:57,236
          But on more           
    than one occasion           

243
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,804
  I've held her place in line   
while she parked the car.       

244
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,924
Could you believe that?         

245
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,477
After I gave that man           
the best 28 months of my life.  

246
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:07,613
          Well, why don't you go
          catch up with him     

247
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,764
            and patch things up.

248
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,899
    Forget it. He's a wimp      
    and he can't get a job.     

249
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:13,035
        And his jealousy        
    is ruining our marriage.    

250
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:15,437
  Not to mention that he left   
  the cap off the toothpaste    

251
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:18,240
 for, like, the kajillionth day 
        in a row.               

252
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,643
                 I had no idea  
                 that the wounds
                 were so deep.  

253
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:25,747
 Well, as far as I'm concerned, 
     he can just go and...      

254
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:27,482
            Oh, God!            

255
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,669
I've just lost the only man     
I've ever loved.                

256
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,971
              Oh, no, wait.     
              Sit here, will ya?

257
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,607
     Listen, he'll come back.   
     Don't you worry about that.

258
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:36,441
    Now, he's not gonna leave   

259
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,409
a beautiful girl like you.      

260
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,378
    You really think so, Sam?   

261
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:42,581
Oh, absolutely.                 
He'll be right back.            

262
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:45,100
        I mean, do you really   
        think I'm beautiful?    

263
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,030
 Hey, anyone see the conclusion 

264
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:00,932
of the <i>White House Murders</i>      
          <i>last night?</i>           

265
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:04,002
         No! Don't say anything.
         I've got it on tape.   

266
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,555
          Did you believe it was
          the vice-president?   

267
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:07,823
    Please!                     

268
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,091
 How about where the First Lady 

269
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,725
      popped out of a pool      
        of her own blood        

270
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,560
         and strangled          
    the Russian ambassador?     

271
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,730
No... No...                     

272
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,464
        Yeah, that              
    was my reaction exactly.    

273
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,551
Well, thank you,                
one and all,                    

274
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:21,486
for ruining yet                 
another plot for me.            

275
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,322
    I'll be off, now,           
    but before I go...          

276
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,824
there's something I'd like      
    to share with you.          

277
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:30,612
    In <i>Citizen Kane.</i> Rosebud    
    is the name of his sled.    

278
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,447
 In <i>Murder on</i>                   
 <i>the Orient Express,</i>            

279
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,082
        everyone did it,        

280
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:37,085
  and Luke Skywalker's father   
         <i>is</i> Darth Vader.        

281
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,119
              Ha!               

282
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,990
        Ah, why doesn't         
        the guy tell us         

283
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:43,025
        something               
      we don't know, huh?       

284
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,544
 Darth Vader is Luke's father?  

285
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,098
         See you soon.          

286
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,498
              Bye.              

287
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,600
                    "Bye."      

288
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:54,102
        How dare she put on     
        that sweetness and light

289
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:56,337
            when it's so obvious
            she's nothing more  

290
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:57,940
                  than a sordid 
                  little harlot.

291
00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,474
                Hypocrite.      

292
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,362
             Doing a great job, 
             Laurie. Keep it up!

293
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,697
I need a couple of drafts, Sam. 

294
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:06,614
        Okay.                   

295
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,884
    But, oh, you, uh,           

296
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,034
              You and Anthony   
              still not talking?

297
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,989
 Talking? I can barely stomach  
    necking with him.           

298
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:15,940
          He's a wimp.          

299
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,826
        Not like my Sam.        

300
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,460
Tell me,                        

301
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,880
        how do you feel         
about moonlit walks by the beach

302
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,648
 and dinner by a roaring fire?  

303
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,568
          I hate them.          
  I-I can't stand them. Bleah.  

304
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,119
Yay! Me, too.                   
                    No, no, no. 

305
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:30,638
     I was kidding. I love them.

306
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,174
Too late.                       

307
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,461
            You know, if someone
            ran over Laurie     

308
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:41,233
    in the parking lot, I bet it
    would look like an accident.

309
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,301
                 Do you want to 
                 make 500 bucks?

310
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,535
Just, don't...                  

311
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,237
Listen to yourself.             

312
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,238
You're going crazy here.        

313
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:48,373
We both have a problem          
with these new waitresses.      

314
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,075
Why don't we help               
each other out, here?           

315
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,810
              Oh, like I scratch
              your back...?     

316
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:54,913
                And I'll scratch
                your front.     

317
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,114
            What do you propose?

318
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,483
Well, all right, uh...          
now, we don't know for sure     

319
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,169
that Laurie <i>is</i>                  
<i>Evan Drake's mistress,</i>          

320
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:01,453
so why don't you                
let a guy                       

321
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:02,954
who knows women                 
better than they                

322
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,889
know themselves                 
find out, all right?            

323
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,108
                        Okay.   

324
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:07,542
                 Laurie, you got
                 a second here? 

325
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:08,543
Yeah.                           

326
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,612
                 How do you feel
                 about, uh...   

327
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:15,551
 moonlit walks on the beach with
 a dinner by a roaring fire?    

328
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,819
Oh, I love those.               

329
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:19,871
                Well, would you 
                like to join me?

330
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:22,907
Oh, no, no, but...              
thanks for asking.              

331
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:27,596
She's his mistress.             

332
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:32,984
     How do you know that?      

333
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:34,802
      She turned me down.       

334
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:38,589
        That just proves        
    she has a weak stomach.     

335
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:39,474
I'll handle this myself.        

336
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,059
              Oh, wait a second.
              Wait a minute.    

337
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:43,095
         What about my little   
         problem here, you know?

338
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,596
Sam, I don't have               
time to handle                  

339
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,098
some silly little               
teenage crush.                  

340
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:47,399
                It is <i>not</i> silly.

341
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,255
Oh, yes, Miss Howe?             

342
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,991
         Laurie, my, you are    
         such a busy little bee.

343
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,792
             I bet you just     
             won't have an ounce

344
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,794
              of energy left for
              your leisure time.

345
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,397
Oh, that's okay.                
I've lots of energy.            

346
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,233
                I'll bet you do.

347
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,868
             You know, you and I
             really haven't had 

348
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:07,402
             a chance to get    
             to know each other.

349
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,072
          What do you like to do
          in your leisure time? 

350
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:12,491
Well, I, uh, I like to read.    

351
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:13,542
        In bed?                 

352
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,877
                Sometimes.      

353
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,345
What else do you                
like to do...                   

354
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,213
    in bed?                     

355
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:20,782
                    Sleep.      

356
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,517
Oh, well.                       

357
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:25,970
Let, let's imagine here,        
that you are asleep in bed,     

358
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,839
and you roll over.              

359
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,006
Did you fall                    
on the floor,                   

360
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,042
or did something                
impede your progress?           

361
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,827
                    Excuse me?  

362
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:33,812
    Oh, nothing.                

363
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:35,163
It's must my warped,            

364
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:37,198
wonderful, wild                 
sense of humor.                 

365
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:39,901
                By the way,     

366
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,035
                how do you      
                know Evan Drake?

367
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,038
Well, he's uh...                
a friend.                       

368
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,508
          Oh. Well, then maybe  
          you could help me out.

369
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,076
     I was gonna buy him a gift.

370
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,111
              Perhaps you know  
              what size he wears

371
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:52,247
             in slacks or shirts
             or jockey shorts.  

372
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,415
Oh... sure,                     

373
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,350
but he doesn't                  
wear jockeys.                   

374
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:56,534
He wears boxers.                

375
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:57,953
            Never mind, then.   

376
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:01,523
    I'm gonna pop her.          

377
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:02,724
    I'm gonna <i>pop</i> her.          

378
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,359
            I'm gonna pop her   
            right in the kisser.

379
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:05,343
              I'm gonna pop <i>her!</i>

380
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,429
    Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!    

381
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:09,748
                    That's good.

382
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,918
                 Now-Now do, uh,
                 bacon frying.  

383
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,710
You know, Darth Vader cannot be 
Luke Skywalker's father.        

384
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,082
        They don't have         
      the same last name.       

385
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,050
            That's right, Woody.

386
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,286
            I'd better call out 
            the Imperial Guards.

( <i>inhaling and exhaling deeply</i> )

388
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,005
     Stop it, Mr. Peterson.     

389
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,323
    You're scaring me.

ANNIE:                          
You know, Sam,                  

391
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,131
I was just thinking             
about us last night             

392
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,867
as I was in the tub             
shaving my legs                 

393
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:50,004
and pumicing the dead skin      
off my knees and elbows         

394
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,356
and waxing my...                

395
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,575
                Uh, is-is there 
                a point to this?

396
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:54,893
Do I have to say it?            

397
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,761
Can't you just feel it?         

398
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:57,762
            Would you stop that?

399
00:16:57,796 --> 00:16:59,047
                  This is silly.
                  Now, just...  

400
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,215
Of course it's silly,           
but love is silly, isn't it?    

401
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,518
Romeo and Juliet were silly     
in a mad, passionate way.       

402
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,086
Are we silly, Sam?              

403
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,287
        Are we?                 

404
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:07,922
                    Y-You maybe,
                    but I'm not.

405
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,809
  Listen, young lady, I happen  
to be a very close friend       

406
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:12,077
                  of your       
                  mother-in-law,

407
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:13,144
      and out of respect,       

408
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:14,879
  I'm ending this conversation  
        right now.              

409
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,898
 You can end the conversation,  
              Sam,              

410
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:19,100
 but you can't end the feeling. 

411
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:20,819
     Honey, I'm flattered,      
    but this is nuts.           

412
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,119
          I mean, I...          

413
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,339
          You know, I'm old     
          enough to be your f...

            a youthful          
            uncle, all right?   

415
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,543
            I mean, when-when...
            when I'm 60,        

416
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:31,213
                you're-you're   
                gonna be 22.    

417
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:33,932
                Oh, my God, that
                can't be right. 

418
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,533
                        Uh...   

419
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,735
                all right, uh...

420
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,753
                 All right, when
                 I'm 60, uh,    

421
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,605
                 well, you'll be
                 looking pretty 
                 good, actually.

422
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:41,807
                    Um...       

423
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,010
            so, why don't you   
            call me when I'm 60?

424
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:45,794
I can't wait that long.         

425
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:46,945
              Oh, don't. Just...

    Hey, knock it off!          

428
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,438
    All right, you, outside.    

429
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:59,140
        You're gonna get        
     what's coming to you.      

430
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:01,376
     I am not going outside     
    with you, Anthony.          

431
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,244
Not you. Her.

I mean, come on.

You're twice as big as me.

Hey, but you stay away from her,
if you know what's good for you.

435

Thank you for the warning.

                  listen to you?

Hey, an important job.

and got him in.

00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,509
As a matter of fact,            

462
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,377
are you interested              
in buying a secondhand car      

463
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,980
with this giant hamburger       
on top?

Mr. Drake is dropping by,       

468
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,840
and I was wondering             
if I could just break away      

469
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,409
for a... for an early lunch.    

470
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,378
                          Lunch.

471
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,614
         Is that the fashionable
         term for it these days?

472
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,083
No, I think                     
I've always called it lunch.    

473
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,152
            Well, you just run  
            along with Mr. Drake

474
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:35,686
                  to your lunch,

475
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:38,256
          and don't eat so much,
          you can't walk back.  

476
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,727
        Okay.                   

477
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:43,995
Excuse me, Sam.                 

478
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,430
What did she mean by that?      

479
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:46,597
                  Oh, she's, uh,

00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,199
             under a lot of     
             pressure nowawdays.

00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:49,367

482
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:51,136
          to help her release   
          some of it, but she...

by asking for an early break.   

485
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,141
                    Mm.         

486
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,943
