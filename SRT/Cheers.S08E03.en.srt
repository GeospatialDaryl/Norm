2
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:08,523
What are you doing         
     here so late, dr. Crane?

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,858
Oh, i had to               
     make a midnight run.

4
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,243
Lilith's having another one 
    of her pregnancy cravings.

5
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:14,445
Oh, no, not again. 
             W-what was it      
             this time, huh?

6
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,031
Oh, just butter and flour.

7
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:17,482
What, she wants            
     to bake something?

8
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,567
No. That's what she was     
    eating when i left.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,138
Bowls of butter            
     and fistfuls of flour.

10
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:25,773
And i had to get out of there.

11
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:28,910
Boy, oh, gee. Pregnancy        
 really makes women screwy,     
 doesn't it?

12
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,612
Yeah, well, it's amazing   
     how they let hormones

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,114
take over their entire body 
    for that period of time.

14
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:35,750
Tell me about it.              
 You know,                      
 the other morning at 4:00,

15
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:38,086
i had to run clear         
     across town to this        
     particular pizzeria

16
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:40,855
to get lilith              
     a deep-dish pizza,         
     4 cheeses,

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,040
with sun-dried tomatoes,       
 prosciutto, and anchovies.

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,727
Oh, my god.                 
    How far did you have to go?

19
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,278
Oh, out by the airport.

20
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,898
That's what? An hour's drive   
 just for a craving?

21
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,232
It's insane, isn't it?

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,633
Well, you were lucky   
         they were open.

23
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,369
Oh, they're open all night.    
                 All night?

24
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:56,571
Ooh, i could use   
             an anchovy pizza.

25
00:00:58,207 --> 00:01:00,008
It's a hell of a pie.

26

my life is fabulous!

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,111
Keep it to yourself.

35
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:54,412
Oh, did i say something?

36
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,347
I must've been         
         thinking out loud.

37
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,217
Thinking out loud           
    about my fabulous life.

38
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:02,253
Does anybody know what

39
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:03,772
time it is?

40
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,578
Why ever do you ask?

41
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:15,483
Well, just because      
        my rich new sweetheart, 
        robin colcord,

42
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,985
sent me this beautiful,

43
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:19,020
very expensive gold watch  
     from zurich,

44
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:21,422
and i can't tell   
             what time it is.

45
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,326
Can you read this?

46
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:28,980
Yeah, it says,                 
 "this could feed my family     
 for a year."

47
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,334
Carla, don't be childish.

48
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,069
If anybody needs me,   
         i'll be skipping       
         around in my office.

49
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,705
Say, uh,                       
 when's your rich boyfriend     
 coming back?

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,973
In about a week.    
     Oh, good, good.

51
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,125
That'll give you time          
 to make up excuses

52
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,760
not to go to bed with him.

53
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:43,644
[Scoffs]

54
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:44,979
i wanna go to bed with him.

55
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,881
I'm just waiting           
     for the right time.

56
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,150
Well, maybe that's why         
 he gave you the watch.

57
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,858
Don't worry, rebecca.          
 There's nothing wrong          
 with making a guy wait.

58
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:59,561
It piques their interest.

59
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:03,915
I once made a guy wait  
        until we were           
        both undressed.

60
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,434
And how do you know 
            that i haven't been 
            to bed with robin?

61
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:08,219
Did sam tell you that?

62
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:11,489
No. I'm a woman.           
     A woman knows.

63
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:12,657
You know, i must say,

64
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,243
i'm with carla         
         on this one.

65
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,879
I mean, there's nothing wrong  
 with 2 people                  
 getting to know each other

66
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,780
before they have               
 a physical relationship.

67
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,616
And how did you know?

68
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:25,002
Well, i'm a psychiatrist.      
 A psychiatrist knows.

69
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,520
What are you               
     waiting for, becky?

70
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,773
Yeah, hit the sheets   
         already, kid.

71
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,059
Sam.

72
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:33,878
Pool players know.

73
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,584
I cannot believe   
             you told everyone.

74
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,520
Not having sex             
     is a very private thing    
     between a man and a woman.

75
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,672
You don't see me           
     going around saying that

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,524
norm and vera               
    didn't have sex last night.

77
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,592
Hey, hey.

78
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,260
Ok, bad example.

79
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,481
The point is,      
             i don't want you   
             talking about me.

80
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,417
There's to be no more gossip   
 about my private life.

81
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,153
Sorry i'm late         
         from lunch.

82
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,422
I made the mistake         
     of mentioning              
     to my waitress that

83
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,424
my boss was            
         dating robin colcord.

84
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:03,791
She wanted to know  
            if it was true

85
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,876
they haven't       
             slept together.

86
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,998
You know,                      
 it is amazing what happens

87
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,934
when you mention       
         that guy's name.       
 Oh, yeah?

88
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,603
I mean, i had all these people 
 swarming around my table,

89
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,806
asking me all kinds 
            of questions:

90
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:20,842
do i know him very well?   
     Do i see him often?

91
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:22,811
Do i want soup or salad?

92
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,130
Yeah, it's tough               
 being a celebrity.

93
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:29,300
You know, i used to            
 get that all the time when     
 i was playing for the sox.

94
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,702
It's a real pain.

95
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,236
Yeah, you're lucky, sam.

96
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:35,039
Everyone forgot about you      
 a long time ago.

97
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,010
Last time                      
 i saw your name in print

98
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,246
was 2 years ago        
         in a crossword puzzle.

99
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,615
"Name a former                 
 red sox player in 15 letters."

100
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,151
And even then i had        
     a lot of spaces left over.

101
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,656
Yeah, well,                    
 i still wouldn't trade places  
 with poor old robin.

102
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,091
"Poor old robin"

103
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,676
happens to be       
            one of the richest,

104
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:57,412
most powerful men  
             in the world.

105
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,714
Not to mention,            
     being generally gorgeous.

106
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:02,416
Yeah, but he hasn't gotten     
 anywhere with rebecca,         
 has he?

107
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:04,886
You didn't get anywhere 
        with that babe, either.

108
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,555
I'm not one of the richest     
 most powerful men              
 in the world.

109
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:09,023
I'm just                       
 a lowly bartender.

110
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,859
What's his excuse?

111
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,260
Good point, sammy.

112
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,262
I--i know why she's not        
 going to bed with that guy.

113
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,298
'Cause there's this little     
 voice in the back of her head  
 that keeps saying:

114
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:20,118
"wouldn't you really           
 rather drive a sammy?"

115
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,603
[All laughing]

116
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,856
that poor chump                
 doesn't stand a chance.

117
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,308
Yeah, but still, sam,          
 it would be nice to have       
 colcord's money, wouldn't it?

118
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,327
Ah, so he's got bucks. I mean, 
 what's he do with it?          
 All he does is hustle.

119
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:31,829
Me? I enjoy my life.

120
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,998
I live it my way               
 on my own terms.

121
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,666
[All agreeing]

122
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,418
and well you should be, sam,   
 you know.

123
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:38,987
You may not be             
     wealthy and powerful,

124
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,888
but those who                  
 really know you respect you.

125
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:41,905
(Man)              
             that's true, sam.

126
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:43,608
Ah, yeah,                      
 thank you very much.

127
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,777
How could we not? You know, 
    you've-- you've been        
    through adversities

128
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,345
that would've crushed      
     other, lesser men.

129
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:48,846
Well, i don't know.

130
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,231
Oh, no, really.

131
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,800
When i think of            
     the sorry state            
     your life's in now...

132
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,820
w-what do you, uh...

133
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:59,557
all right, yeah. Maybe i'm not 
 as young as i used to be,

134
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,527
and maybe i did blow       
     my life savings,

135
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:05,062
and maybe this job          
    doesn't pay that much,

136
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,565
and maybe i don't have

    to look forward to,

138
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:12,637
but at least...

139
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,540
what, sam?

140
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,542
At least i'm happy.

141
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,393
(All)                  
         that's true.

142

[All agreeing]

143
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,614
and that's why         
         we admire you.

144
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,582
You know,                      
 i think i speak for everyone   
 in the bar here when i say,

145
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,083
that if it had been any of us,

146
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,252
we would've blown              
 our brains out years ago.

147
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,508
Ah, that's very sweet          
 of you guys.

148
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,176
You know, i think the--

149
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,745
i think the secret's           
 not to sweat the small stuff.  
                 There you go.

150
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:40,381
It'd take a hell of a lot      
 more than that                 
 to get under my skin.

151
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,683
Sam, remember to               
 fill up all the pretzel bowls.

152
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,419
Oh, that does it!      
         I hate this life!

153
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,087
I don't mind               
     that other stuff,

154
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,557
but i can't stand          
     the damn pretzels.

155
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,093
Well, things are going to  
     change around here,        
     you know.

156
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,561
I'm gonna change.

157
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,062
I'm gonna be somebody.

158
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,598
Who can i be?

159
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,569
Sam, if you feel a need        
 for a new direction in life,

160
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:05,006
uh, perhaps a career change    
 would be in order.

161
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,373
Well, for example, uh,

162
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,958
getting one.

163
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,160
Yeah.

164
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,229
Yeah, that's not bad.

165
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,932
Except all i've ever       
     enjoyed doing

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,568
is playing baseball        
     and running this bar.

167
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,403
I'm too old            
         to play baseball,

168
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:21,839
and i don't own            
     this bar anymore.          
     So that's that.

169
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,641
Why don't you              
     start another bar?

170
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,375
Ah, yeah, where am i           
 gonna get the money?

171
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:27,444
Well, i have some money 
        i'd like to invest.

172
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,314
I can't take                   
 your money, frase.

173
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,281
Thank goodness.

174
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,434
I suddenly had an image    
     of lilith coming after me  
     with a cleaver.

175
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:38,506
Sammy, why don't you   
         just get a loan, huh?

176
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,174
Oh, i could do that.           
 But, you know,

177
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,677
another bar's                  
 not going to be                
 the same as cheers.

178
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:45,079
Cheers wasn't cheers           
 before you bought it, sammy.

179
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:47,849
It was just another        
     boring run of the mill     
     beer hall.

180
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,550
How do you know?        
        I was here every night.

181
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,571
You made cheers            
     what it is, pal.

[Men agreeing]          
         (man)                  
         it's true, sammy.

183
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,141
I did, didn't i?           
        You're damn right.

184
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,561
Yeah, and i'm still sammy. 
     I could do that again.

185
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:00,978
Yeah.  
 I agree.

186
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,496
All right, maybe this is what  
 i've been needing.

187
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,950
You know, a whole new chance   
 to start over again.

188
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,669
This kind of feels good.

189
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,821
It's amazing how       
         when you get a focus   
         on your life,

190
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,257
everything just         
        falls into place.

191

Kind of feel like i'm   
        a guy with a dream.

 put out plenty of pork rinds.

194
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,346
So how much longer         
     are you gonna be           
     in switzerland, anyway?

195
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,650
Well, couldn't you just 
        jet in for the weekend?

How do you             
         handle it?

201
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,037
Well, when my eddie's away     
 with the ice show,

202
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,439
i just picture him             
 having a great time.

203
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,623
Yeah?

204

You bet. Carousing,            
 drinking with the boys,

205
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:08,246
carrying on                    
 with some floozy.

206
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,681
And i call him up              
 in the middle of the night     
 and i curse at him

207
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,416
until he begs me               
 to forgive him.

208
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:15,503
Even though he probably        
 didn't do anything wrong       
 to begin with.

209
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,871
And that helps?

210

Boys, boys.

212

     closing time anyway,

what do you say we, uh,    
     go do a little after-hours

214

            any doubt?

Of course, i did.

219
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,360
It needs a little work, 
        but you know,           
        a little elbow grease,

220
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,779

            as great as cheers. 
            Wanna go?

         or go home, you know.

 this place could be as         
 fun as world war ii.

00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:14,715
Yeah, they don't            
    make 'em like that anymore.

276
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,767
And if look under this ratty   
 old linoleum

277
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,902
you'll find the, uh,           
 the original oak floor.

278
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,305
Come over here, you guys,      
 look at this.

279
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,473
Huh?

280
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,392
Wow, marble.           
         That's a beauty, sam.

281
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,912
Yeah, you bet.     
             All the original   
             brass fixtures

282
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,047
are around the back, there.

283
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:32,182
I tell you, as soon as this 
    loan comes through,

284
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,918
i'm going to own    
            one classy bar.

285
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,419
[Laughs]

286
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,421
all right, and i get           
 first pick of the barstools.

287
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,789
This one right here.

288
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,325
That's the one you want?

289
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,626
You bet.

290
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,602
Yeah, i'll take, uh,

291
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,070
i'll take this one.

292
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,740
Yeah.

293
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,476
Don't you, uh, want            
 to sit next to me?

294
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,313
You could move down.

295
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,799
But then i won't           
     get my first pick.

296
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,317
I won't tell anyone.

297
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,503
You're a real pal, normie.

298
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,639
(Sam)                          
 ah, look at you guys.

299
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:13,874
You're getting          
        the hang of this thing.

300
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:16,810
Can't you just imagine     
     me and woody               
     behind the bar,

301
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:18,145
carla waiting tables,

302
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:19,679
you two sitting at         
     your places?

303
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:20,981
All right.

304
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,950
It's gonna be           
        just as good as cheers. 
         Eh, huh?

305
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,268
It's gonna be              
     better than cheers.

306
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,402
(Cliff)                
         yeah?

307
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,903
You're gonna drive up      
     to the front door,

308
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:28,372
and someone's gonna        
     take your car.

309
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,174
No, no, no, we can't           
 afford valet.

310
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,343
I know,                        
 but there's a couple of        
 neighborhood kids out there

311
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,910
doing it for free.

312
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,980
My car.

313
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,315
My car!

314
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,449
My car! My car!

315
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:39,683
Wait! Wait a minute!           
 Wait!

316
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,541
Everybody,             
         sit up straight.

317
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,592
Robin's back from europe.

318
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Come on.                       
 Up, up, up.

319
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,950
All right, he just called      
 from his car phone

320
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:57,818
to ask if he could             
 pop by for a minute.

321
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:00,921
"Pop."                         
 Isn't robin adorable?

322
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,273
Well, he does have         
     haunting eyes.

323
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,712
Well, he does,                 
 doesn't he?

324
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,097
I think the important thing    
 is that

325
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:12,032
mr. Colcord is gonna find      
 an entirely new woman

326
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,934
from the one                   
 he saw 2 weeks ago.

327
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,569
A hungry woman.

328
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:17,454
A confident woman.

329
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,689
A woman who's willing          
 to give to her man

330
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,842
with total abandon.

331
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,143
I think i see him coming.

332
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,795
I'm not ready yet.

333
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,399
Jeez. Women.

334
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,701
You can't live with them,

335
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,136
pass the beer nuts.

336
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,345
Is miss howe in?

337
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:42,913
Oh, yeah,              
         she's in her office.

338
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,481
Ah, mr. Colcord? Excuse me.

339
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,751
Um, you just got back  
         from switzerland,      
         right?

340
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,085
Yes.

341
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,536
Now, uh, do you--      
         do you go over there

342
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,038
and talk with those        
     swiss people very often?

343
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,506
Every few months.

344
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,408
Um, listen, you think      
     if i gave you some money,

345
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:58,162
you could maybe        
         pick up one of those   
         army knives for me?

346
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,318
There may be, um,              
 customs restrictions.

347
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:05,402
Oh, then forget it.

348
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,071
I'll just go       
             to the drugstore.

349
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,222
Yeah.

350
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:16,897
Boy, uh, you got to go figure, 
 a rich guy like that.

351
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,565
Why is he putting up           
 with rebecca

352
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,634
if she's not, you know,        
 putting out for him?

353
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,287
Maybe all              
         of the equipment's     
         not in working order.

354
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,822
There you go.  
                Oh.

355
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,108
Or maybe he's got      
         so many other babes    
         on the side

356
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,093
he just doesn't         
        have time for her, huh?

357
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,061
Yeah.                  
             Now, that's good.

358
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,847
Or maybe he's a gentleman.

359
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:36,100
Woody, who the hell 
            brought you up?

360
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,006
Hey, boys.

361
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,608
You're looking          
        at a scale model        
        of sam's place.

362
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,510
You're still           
         going through          
         with that thing, sam?

363
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,295
Oh, yeah, yeah.                
 The loan came through today.

364
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,348
This thing's happening.

365
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:53,550
What, even after mr. Clavin's  
 car got stolen, stripped,      
 and left across town?

366
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,837
[Muttering]                    
 that was just, you know,       
 one little incident.

367
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:58,789
A friend of mine       
         down at city hall says 
         it serves me right

368
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,959
for parking my car 
             in the worst crime 
             sector in boston.

369
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,861
I don't believe it.

370
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,396
You were there. 
                You saw it.

371
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,498
No. That you                   
 have a friend.

372
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,818
Come on, guys. Well, hey,  
     doesn't this look great?

373
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,354
Lovely. 
         Oh, that may be, sam,

374
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:16,373
but, you know,                 
 there's an old real estate     
 maxim that says

375
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:17,741
the 3 most                     
 important things

376
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,009
in looking                     
 for a property are:

377
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,978
location,                      
 location, location.

378
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,413
That's just one thing.

379
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,551
That's the point,  
             woody.

380
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,036
What, that real estate         
 people are stupid?

381
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,276
No, that location is           
 the one most important thing   
 in real estate.

382
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,462
Then why do they say           
 it's 3 things?

383
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,915
Because real estate 
            people are stupid.

384
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:45,452
Ah-ha.

385
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:51,558
Why am i talking   
             to you guys?

386
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,627
You don't know         
         anything about bars.

387
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,463
I'm telling you,               
 this is going to be            
 the best damn bar in boston.

388
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,449
Ah, what's that?

389
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,200
Oh, mr. Colcord.

390
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:03,036
N-nothing.                 
     I was just, uh,            
     just talking, that's all.

391
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,622
No, you seemed, uh, pretty     
 excited about something        
 just now.

392
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,823
[Rebecca scoffs]

393
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,758
sam wants to reopen        
     some stupid, disgusting,

394
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,960
run-down place                 
 on the waterfront.

395
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:12,196
Small world.

396
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,164
I own some             
         property down there.

397
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:15,499
Perhaps we'll           
        be neighbors.

398
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,017
Really?

399
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:19,169
You think that             
     this would be a good place 
     to open a business?

400
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,888
Well, i'd like to hear     
     your plans.

401
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:24,991
Well, great. Yeah, great.  
     Why don't we, uh, just...

402
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,327
can we use the office?

403
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:27,994
No.

404
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,829
It'll only be              
     for a moment.

405
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:31,064
What, did i say "no"?

406
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,366
I meant to say "yes."

407
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,734
I mean,                        
 i very rarely ever say "no."

408
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,119
Like tonight,                  
 i'll be saying "yes."

409
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,972
Yes, yes, yes!

410
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,613
I think this gives you 
         a pretty good idea

411
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,015
of what the place  
             will look like.

412
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,583
Except, you know, bigger.

413
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:54,688
So, what you're                
 finally saying is,

414
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,156
you're gonna reopen        
     the same business

415
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:59,026
in the same location        
    where it went               
    belly-up just last year.

416
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,928
No, no, no.                
     See, this is new. This is  
     completely different.

417
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,397
Now it's sam's place.

418
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:04,315
What was it before?

419
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:05,732
Tim's place.

420
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,254
Sam, do you want               
 my, um, honest opinion?

421
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:11,922
Oh, yeah, you bet.

422
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,907
This could work.            
                 Yes!

423
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:20,563
By work i mean, if you pour    
 every dime you've got          
 into the place,

424
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,600
struggle, scrimp, and save,    
 and somehow hang on            
 through the lean years

425
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,719
you might begin                
 to show a tiny profit.

426
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,955
After that,            
         living month by month, 
         year after year,

427
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,456
praying there's no recession,

428
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,741
you might actually     
         scrape a living,

429
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,394
a dismal, altruist         
     living out of it.

430
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:36,463
Ok. Ok.

431
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,632
So, um,                    
     what's the downside?

432
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:44,171
Sam, don't             
         shortchange yourself.

433
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:46,740
Do you want just any bar       
 or do you want the best bar?

434
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,444
Look here.             
         I've always found that

435
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:52,329
the secret of success is

436
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,482
having a dream and then    
     having the courage         
     to run after it.

437
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,284
Reach for       
                the stars, sam.

438
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:58,919
Astonish me.

439
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,238
Astonish yourself.

440
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,323
Yeah. All right.

441
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:04,758
Now, i get this. I get--   
     all right.

442
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:06,693
Y-you're saying         
        that i, uh--

443
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:09,412
i shouldn't settle             
 for this crummy little place.

444
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,064
Exactly.            
         Yeah.

445
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,733
Yeah, i should, uh, buy        
 the whole block.

446
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,519
Keep talking.

447
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,538
Right, and i could, uh,        
 i could tear it all down and-- 
 and--and build a high rise

448
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,674
with a great river view.       
             That's wonderful.

449
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,177
And apartments and condos,     
 and 24-hour donut shops.

450
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:27,814
And--and--and a real big tall  
 building with sam's place      
 on the top.

451
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:30,267
And it'll be the best damn bar 
 on the east coast.

452
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,585
Beautiful, sam.             
    Can you do it?

453
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,137
Yes, i can.                
     No, you can't.

454
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:34,371
No, i can't.            
 No, you can't.

455
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:39,493
Come down to earth,    
         for god's sake.

456
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:46,984
Sam, w-w-what you gotta    
     ask yourself is:

457
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,286
"what do i really want?"

458
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:53,273
Well, i don't       
            know what i, uh...

459
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,725
what i really...

460
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,644
well,              
             i ougtta tell you  
             what i want.

461
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,245
I want my--my beat-up      
     old desk back.

462
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,381
I want my sports stuff  
        back on the walls.

463
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,784
I want to get rid of those 
     creepy plants out there

464
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:06,870
and that stupid world map   
    of wherever the hell it is.

465
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,443
I want cheers.

466
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,911
Then do it.

467
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:15,712
Oh, god.

468
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,764
I mean, i--i'd love to get     
 cheers back.

469
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:20,167
But i--i don't even think      
 i can get out of this--this    
 crummy little deal here.

470
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:22,169
See, i'd be happy to make  
     some phone calls for you.

471
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:23,954
I know quite a few people  
     around town.

472
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,056
That's my, uh, private number.

473
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,274
[Exclaims]

474
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,309
well, god, this is great.  
     Thank you.

475
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,678
Uh, i don't know               
 if i can ever repay you here.

476
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,064
Let's just say,     
            you owe me a favor.

477
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,199
All right. Yeah.

478
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:39,670
All right, one favor. Anytime. 
 Yeah. Thanks very much.

479
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:41,872
Hey, guys!                     
 Hey, listen to this!

480
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,274
I'm not going to buy           
 that stupid crummy bar.

481
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,676
[All cheering half-heartedly]

482
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:47,911
i'm gonna buy                  
 this stupid crummy bar.

483
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,546
[All cheering wildly]

484
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,323
hey, rebecca,                  
 can i work the next shift?     
 I need the overtime.

485
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,975
Sam, look, i know what     
     you're trying to do here.  
     But forget it.

486
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,677
It's gonna take you    
         the rest of your life

487
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,679
to save enough money       
     to buy cheers.

488
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:09,233
Hey, if sam says            
    he can do it, he can do it.

489
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,719
We have faith in you, sam. 
     Cheers is gonna be yours.

490
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:15,355
I just hope                
     i'm still alive to see it.

491
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,777
Is rebecca in?

492
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,963
Yeah. She's, uh, she's         
 in her office.

493
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,032
Oh. I'll have a brandy.

494
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,900
Say, uh, mr. Colcord,

495
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,234
i just want to thank you

496
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,804
for, uh, getting me out of     
 that other deal so fast.

497
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,390
Well, uh, let's say    
         you owe me one, eh?    
 Yeah, right, right.

498
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,659
Actually, i had a thought      
 about that other idea we had.

499
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,243
And i decided           
        that might be fun, too.

500
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,945
What idea was that?

501
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,747
Well, you remember,    
         the high rise          
         with the river view.

502
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:42,999
It turns out                   
 it's adjacent to the property  
 that i'm developing,

503
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,836
so i decided to buy    
         the whole block        
         and give it a go.

504
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,188
But you--you said              
 that was impossible.

505
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:49,673
No, i said it was   
            impossible for you.

506
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,442
For me                 
         it was 2 phone calls   
         and a handshake.

507
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:52,743
[Chuckles]

508
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,395
but that was--             
     that was my idea.

509
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:56,647
Was it?

510
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,031
So hard to recall.

511
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,166
The ideas were flying   
        so fast and furious     
        in there, weren't they?

512
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,368
Wait--wait a minute.

513
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,737
Now, if i'd bought         
     that--that property,

514
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:06,439
couldn't i have                
 sold it to you for a profit?

515
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:09,593
But you wouldn't take  
         advantage of a friend, 
         would you?

516
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,146
You--you talked me             
 out of that place just so      
 you could get it yourself.

517
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,715
No, i--i didn't talk you   
     out of anything.

518
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:16,116
I talked you into      
         following your heart.

519
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:17,984
You're a man        
            with a dream, sam.

520
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:19,353
I envy you.

521
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,787
But if it makes you 
            feel any better,

522
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,673
i'm willing to          
        come to an arrangement.

523
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,641
Oh, yeah?                  
            Yes, uh, let's see.

524
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,344
Yes. You no longer  
            owe me a favor.

525
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,701
Oh, uh, robin.

526
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,303
I'm all set.               
     Let me just get my purse.

527
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,388
Darling, you look lovely.

528
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,105
I'll get miles to      
         bring the car around.

529
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:41,407
And, um, oh,           
         that's for the drink.

530
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,851
So, rebecca,                   
 tonight's the big night, huh?

531
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,953
[Giggles]

532
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,574
it's not                
        gonna happen.

533
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,509
I can feel it.

534
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,078
It's not                
        gonna happen.

535
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,646
I know that i'm gonna  
         chicken out again.

536
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh, robin's gonna be   
         so disappointed.

537
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:07,734
No. No, he won't.

538
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:10,069
He's already               
     done it to me today.
