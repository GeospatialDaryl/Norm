         look at that baby go.

[Train whistle blows]      
 yes, siree-o,

00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,810
2 mail cars                    
 serving the citizens           
 of this great land, woody.

6
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:14,212
Cliffie, come on, man.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,481
I laid the track for you,      
 i helped you with the wiring,

8
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,416
when do i get to       
         handle the controls?

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,668
When i think                   
 you're good and ready,         
 there, young man.

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,703
That's right,  
                 mr. Peterson.

11
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,604
When we think          
         you're good and ready.

12
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:25,640
Hey, carla,     
                check this out.

13
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,942
Mr. Clavin came up 
             with a great idea  
             for this railroad

14
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,427
i think you're     
             really gonna like.

15
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:31,146
Does it involve                
 tyin' him to the tracks

16
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,880
with a stick of dynamite       
 in his mouth?

17
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,666
Oh, now, look, carla.

18
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,868
This baby is a great       
     labor-saving device.       
     You'll see. Now, uh...

19
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,187
look, why don't you just       
 sit right down over there

20
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:40,672
and pretend                 
    that you're a customer.

21
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,874
So, what'll you have, missy?

22
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:45,043
Gee, i love role-playing.

23
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,113
May i have a beer, please,     
 mr. Bartender?

24
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,181
One brew,          
             coming right up.

25
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:51,399
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,351
All right, n-n-norm, now,      
 take heed, here.

27
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:56,204
It takes a steady hand     
     to man a throttle.

28
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,673
Yeah, but it only  
             takes one finger   
             to throw a switch.

29
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:05,096
Last stop,

sam, why do i always           
 have to learn everything       
 from the newspaper?

47
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:26,761
Look at this column.

48
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,747
"On this day               
     in boston's history."

49
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,066
Yeah, so? I mean,              
 they run this column           
 every day.

50
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:36,037
It tells you what happened     
 10 years ago, 50 years ago.

51
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,939

no, no, no.                    
 This only goes back            
 100 years.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,964
Why are you all 
                so interested   
                in my sex life?

55
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,450
Well, somebody has to be.

56
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:51,503
Oh, hey, look at that.         
 Did you see this, rebecca?

57
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,770
[Scoffs]       
                 duh.

58
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,608
"100 years ago today,

59

Oh, wait, wait.         
        A mailman never forgets 
        an address. Now...

61
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,949
why is 112-and-a-half       
    beacon street

62
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,651
sending a message          
     to my brain?

63
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,953
Probably because       
         you're sittin' on it.

64
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,958
Carla, i hate it               
 when you make those            
 sittin'-on-my-brain jokes.

65
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,110
No, no, no, no, 
                cliffie,

66
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:17,195
she meant      
                 112-and-a-half 
                 beacon street.

67
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,964
That's cheers' address. 
        You're sittin' here.

68
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:22,317
No. I was making               
 a cliff-sittin'-on-his-brain   
 joke.

69
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,535
See? I told you.           
     Thank you, carla.

70
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:28,106
The point is,           
        this is our centennial.

71
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,242
Cheers is              
         100 years old.

72
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:32,677
Hang on there.                 
 I-isn't there                  
 a sign outside that says,

73
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,546
"established in 1895"?

74
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:37,065
No, uh, don't pay              
 any attention to that.         
 I made that number up.

75
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,099
[Scoffs]

76
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,550
you what?

77
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,786
I-it was back when carla was   
 into that numbers stuff.

78
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,789
You mean the science           
 of numerology, sam.

79
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:49,060
You see, boss,                 
 if you take 1-8-9-5            
 and you reduce it,

80
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,629
you come out to a 5.

81
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:53,131
Whereas 1-8-8-9                
 comes out to an 8.

82
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:56,267
And 5 for me is obviously      
 a much luckier number          
 than an 8.

83
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,302
Wait, wait, wait, now, 
         you have 8 children.

84
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,572
Exactly,                       
 and i should've stopped at 5.

85
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,124
Well, anyway,              
     i gotta tell you,

86
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,260
i'm going to make the most     
 of this centennial thing.

87
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,362
I already have woody           
 at the library doing research,

88
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:10,431
and i think            
         we'll all dress        
         in gay '90s costumes.

89
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,432
What? No, no. No.

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,318
No, no, no.                    
     Oh, yes, yes, yes.

91
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,736
We are gonna spend 
             the entire week

92
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,989
celebrating the fabulous   
     100 years of cheers.

93
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,092
[Groaning]              
        those centennial things 
        are so dorky.

94
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:24,946
I actually think           
     i'll roll back the prices  
     to 1889 prices.

95
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,915
Like, beer would be            
 5 cents a glass.

96
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:29,583
All right, dork line forms 
     right behind me.

97
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:34,488
See? This is                   
 really gonna be big.

98
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,591
You know, i'm gonna call       
 mayor flynn's office,

99
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:39,060
and see if they'll designate   
 cheers a landmark.

100
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,495
I just wish i had          
     an in with him.

101
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,814
An in? Well, uh,

102
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,149
i-i've been corresponding      
 with his honor

103
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,785
for, you know,             
     about a year now,          
     every week.

104
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,687
Just write him             
     little missives,

105
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,054
you know,                      
 talking about the running      
 of our fair city.

106
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,873
You--you might wanna       
     mention my name.

107
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,659
Right, cliff.                  
 And when i speak               
 to president bush,

108
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,794
i'll remember you          
     to him, too.

109
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,713
Nah, don't bother.             
 We're not on speaking terms.

110
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:03,717
He forgot to send me           
 a thank-you for the inaugural  
 fruitcake i sent him.

111
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,174
Oh, look who's here.           
 It's wimpy and blimpy.

112
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,344
Haven't popped             
     that kid yet, huh?

113
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,462
Oh, no, no, no, no. 
            Lilith had the baby 
            weeks ago.

114
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,731
We just decided        
         to put it back in      
         for old times' sake.

115
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,969
Frasier, don't snipe.          
 People are interested.

116
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,671
Oh, all right,             
     i'll behave.

117
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,156
I guess i'm just       
         a little overanxious

118
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,058
to finally see         
         the slimy little rat.

119
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,228
Frasier, the child             
 will be born

120
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,929
when the child is ready        
 to be born.

121
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,065
(Cliff)                        
 well, enjoy your freedom,      
 lilith.

122
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,951
'Cause once you've gone        
 through the unspeakable        
 horror of childbirth

123
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,769
and the painful drudgery       
 of parenthood,

124
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,137
you'll spend               
     the rest of your life

125
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,590
wishing that               
     you'd sold the little brat 
     to the gypsies.

126
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,008
How would you know?

127
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,927
Ah, that's what        
         my ma tells me.

128
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,033
Aha! Mayor flynn's office  
     loves the idea.

129
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,452
He's not only gonna name       
 next saturday "cheers day,"

130
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,989
he may also come here          
 in person to present us        
 with a special plaque.

131
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,624
Oh, woody,

132
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,693
i'm glad you're back.          
 What'd you find out            
 at the library?

133
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,211
Oh, a bunch of stuff.

134
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,213
You know, like they have, uh,

135
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,300
story hour                     
 every tuesday and thursday.

136
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,769
The fine for overdue books     
 is 10 cents a day,

137
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,439
and you can't               
    yell out things like,       
    "wow, 10 cents a day?"

138
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,625
Woody, i mean,                 
 what did you find out

139
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:19,227
about the history              
 of this place?

140
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:20,195
Nothing much.

141
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:21,795
Really?

142
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:24,115
Just pullin' your chain!       
 Yank, yank!

143
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,586
No, no, looky here.

144
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,589
I got this great big           
 boston history book.

145
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,023
Near as i can figure,

146
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,059
this place was originally  
     called "mom's."

147
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:36,511
Mom's.             
                         Heh.

148
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,580
You know, i bet mom was        
 some twinkly little old lady

149
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,649
and all the whalers            
 used to come in here and--

150
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:45,186
and--and order her             
 homemade apple pie.

151
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:49,107
Well, no. Actually, uh, 
        mom was an              
        "aging ex-fan dancer

152
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:50,508
"who provided free  
            room and board

153
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,677
to attractive, newly arriving  
 immigrant groups."

154
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,201
Woody, please say,             
 "yank, yank."

155
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:02,403
No, it says so     
             right here.

156
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,737
You know,                  
     this actually reminds me

157
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:06,390
of a cute little old place 
     they had back in hanover.

158
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,093
Woody,                         
 you've got the wrong idea.

159
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,344
Yeah, you're probably right.

160
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,847
The place          
             back in hanover    
             was a whorehouse.

161
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:25,126
[139th street quartet singing] 
  in town,                     
 we're back in town 

162
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,233
that was fantastic!

163
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:34,835
Aren't you guys                
 supposed to have a monkey?

164
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,793
All right, guys,               
 does this look like 1889?

165
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:45,146
Hey!

166
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,965
Didn't we agree            
     to all wear costumes?      
         Uh-huh.

167
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,450
Well, why didn't you?

168
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,068
Look at me,                
     i'm the only one.          
     I look like an idiot.

169
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,253
That's why.

170
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,890
People,                        
 will you help me here?

171
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,060
I'm trying to create        
    a turn-of-the-century mood.

172
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:00,845
So am i. Sammy, here's $5.

173
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,981
Can i have 100 beers, please?

174
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,305
You know,               
        everything's coming out 
        pretty good.

175
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:14,809
The mayor's on his way,        
 the 5:00 news                  
 is gonna send a camera team,

176
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:15,993
oh, and i see                  
 my singers are here.

177
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,561
Yeah, thanks a lot             
 for them.

178
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,381
Now i have to put up       
     with barbershop all day.   
     I hate barbershop.

179
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,549
Where do you get               
 your hair cut, sam?

180
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,354
Oh.                        
             Here. Tell 'em     
             sam sent you.

181
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,141
Sam, the quartet           
     is very, very important.

182
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,361
I want everything           
    to be just like it was      
    at the turn of the century.

183
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,732
 Wait till                 
    the sun shines, nelly 

184
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,368
 and the clouds   
             go drifting by 

185
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,002
just knock it off,         
     will you?

186
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,671
Sam!

187
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,573
Oh, come on.           
         That kind of stuff's

188
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,642
been getting           
         on people's nerves     
         for 100 years.

189
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,344
It's time somebody         
     did something about it.

190
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,881
No offense.

191
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:58,419
Miss howe?

192
00:08:58,487 --> 00:08:59,320
[Gasps]

193
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:00,871
oh, goody, goody!

194
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,706
It's my special guest.

195
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:05,643
Hi, everybody,                 
 i want you to meet mr. Weaver.

196
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,812
Come in, mr. Weaver.

197
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:11,849
Sam, i'd like you   
            to meet mr. Weaver.

198
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,085
He's over 106 years old.

199
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,104
Really?                        
 Why, you don't look it,        
 i guess.

200
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,839
I mean,                    
     who would know, huh?

201
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,477
The reason mr. Weaver's        
 our guest of honor today

202
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,996
is because he used to live     
 in this neighborhood.

203
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:29,150
Do you get it? He was here     
 when cheers opened.

204
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:32,336
Big deal.          
             I'm always here    
             when cheers opens.

205
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,054
I mean originally.

206
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:38,292
Mr. Weaver confirmed           
 that there was a beer tavern   
 here in 1889.

207
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,444
This man                       
 is a living treasure.

208
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,980
Hey, wait a minute.

209
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,552
Did you just pinch me?

210
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,755
Did i? Bad boy.

211
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,828
Hey!

212
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:01,499
Hey, mac. Pinch me again   
     and you won't live to 107.

213
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,969
 Wait till--               
         you shut up!

214
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:11,759
Lilith, i promise              
 i will never say another word  
 about inducing labor.

215
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,260
Thank you.         
         Boo!

216
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:20,134
Frasier, it's not hiccups.     
 You can't scare it out.

217
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,337
My god, lilith,                
 you still haven't              
 delivered that child yet?

218
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,972
No, i haven't, rebecca.

219
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,174
Lilith's logic is      
         that if she can keep   
         clenching long enough

220
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:29,377
we may bypass      
             the terrible twos.

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,618
Frasier, i'm not clenching.    
 The child is simply            
 not ready to be born.

222
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:41,271
Lilith, the child              
 is 2 weeks overdue.

223
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,373
Boy, 2 weeks overdue?

224
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,943
Why, you'd be out $1.40     
    at the library.

225
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:53,817
[Gasps]

226
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,237
oh, my god, it's him!  
         It's the mayor.

227
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,205
Hey, hey! It really    
         is the mayor. Hi!

228
00:10:58,273 --> 00:10:59,791
And look,                  
     he's got a little plaque.

229
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,926
Well, he's probably 
            too busy to brush   
            between meals.

230
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,994
No.

231
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,031
How do you do, 
                 your honor?

232
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,918
I'm rebecca howe.      
         Welcome to cheers'     
         100th anniversary.

             Meet my staff.

         How do.

carla lebec, the mayor. 
         Pleased to meet you.

237
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,293
So what's with     
             all the potholes   
             on my street?

238
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:22,330
Carla.

239
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,415
It's all right,        
         i voted for him twice.

240
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,852
In the same election.

241
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,956
Um, i'm sure you're joking,    
 but i'll look into             
 those potholes for you.

242
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,575
Mayor, if you'd come this way, 
 then i think we'll have time--

243
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,294
uh, excuse me, mr. Mayor.      
 We haven't had the honor yet.

244
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,365
[Clearing throat]              
 i'm somebody who sort of       
 writes you about once a week.

245
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,167
You might remember the name.   
 Cliff clavin?

246
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,186
Clavin. Clavin.            
     Uh, why does that name     
     ring a bell?

247
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:47,455
Your honor.

248
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,308
Oh, my god.            
         He's the one. Yeah.

249
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,860
See if he's armed.

250
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,363
[Shouting]

251
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,131
there's got to be  
             a mistake here.

252
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,884
I mean, i'm not a fanatic. 
     I-i'm a member of          
     the u.S. Postal service.

253
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,786
Yep, he's the guy              
 all right.

254
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:03,771
What're you talking about?     
 You-you-you're just miffed

255
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,841
because you didn't get         
 an inaugural fruitcake         
 on your election.

256
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:08,442
Well, you can              
     hold your breath, pal,

257
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,062
'cause when                    
 i get out of jail...

258
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,948
excuse me, your honor,     
     we've known cliff clavin   
     for a long time.

259
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,449
He's ok.   
            Yeah.

260
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:18,052
So you don't think             
 he could snap                  
 and become violent?

261
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:22,189
Uh, well, "ok" might be        
 too strong of a word.

262
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:26,527
Your honor, i--i can           
 assure you that that is not    
 typical of our clientele here.

263
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:28,995
Most of the people     
         that come in here are,

264
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,764
well, they're professionals.

265
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,601
You know, i'm beginning 
        to wonder if you're fit 
        to carry my seed.

266
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,802
I'm beginning to wish          
 you'd kept it.

267
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,310
Aren't they fun?

268
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:45,029
Oh, oh, your honor, 
            wait, please.

269
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,331
I would like you    
            to meet mr. Weaver.

270
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:50,734
Mr. Weaver is       
            over 106 years old

271
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,502
and still very active.

272
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,773
Carla.

273
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,877
Would you please show          
 mr. Weaver our relaxing        
 and lovely billiards lounge?

274
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,462
Let's go, pops.

275
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,631
Put your hands in your pockets 
 and walk 5 feet                
 in front of me.

276
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:10,220
Well, now that we have         
 this quiet time alone,

277
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,890
maybe now would be         
     a good time for you        
     to present that plaque.

278
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,558
Absolutely, miss howe.

279
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,560
Ready when you are,            
 mr. Mayor.                     
     Thank you, bob.

280
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,896
On behalf of the people     
    of the city of boston,

281
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,631
it is a great pleasure--       
         hey, hey, hey!

282
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:23,083
The old geezer                 
 just keeled over               
 on the pool table.

283
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,286
Oh, boy.                   
     Somebody get a doctor.     
     I'm a doctor.

284
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:26,620
Oh, really, lilith.

285
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,122
I suppose you'll revive him    
 by having a baby on him.

286
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,327
Would you just step on it?

287
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,362
There are people waiting       
 to use that pool table.

288
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,714
(Frasier)   
                    i know it.

289
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:39,083
Just as well, seeing as        
 i just went into labor.

290
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,284
Yow!                    
                Oh!

291
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,386
Whoa!                      
             Okay.

292
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:45,522
 Wait till                    
 the sun shines, nelly 

293
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,024
(all)               
            shut up!

294
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,633
(Sam)                   
        excuse me, can i have   
        your attention, please?

295
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,219
Oh, thank god.                 
 How are you, mr. Weaver?

296
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,672
He's fine.                 
     He has something he wants  
     to say to everybody.

297
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,341
I'm sorry.     
     Sorry for what?

298
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:07,094
He just faked the heart attack 
 so girls would bend over him.

299
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:12,566
Although, personally,      
     i think that was           
     rather clever.

300
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,622
Darling, sam just told me. 
     Are you feeling            
     any discomfort?

301
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,907
Whoa!

302
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,859
I--i'll take that      
         as a yes.

303
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,529
I'll go pull the car around,   
 we'll be at the hospital       
 in no time.

304
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:28,482
Woody, would you help her  
     with her lamaze?           
             What's lamaze?

305
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,668
Oh, woody, there's no time     
 for that now.                  
 All right, very briefly.

306
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,621
It's a psychoprophylactic   
    relaxation method.

307
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:38,276
It was discovered by the great 
 late dr. Fernand lamaze        
 while on a trip to russia.

308
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:41,979
It was later perfected--       
         holy mother of pearl!

309
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,548
Well, just go "hoo, hoo, hoo,  
 hee, hee, hee!"

310
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,767
I'm gonna, uh,     
             boil some water.

311
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,202
What for?

312
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,338
I'm gonna have some tea.   
     Do you want some?

313
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,676
How's that go, again?

314
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,762
(Both)                 
         hoo, hoo, hoo.         
         Hee, hee, hee.

315
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,398
Hoo, hoo, hoo.         
         Hee, hee, hee.

316
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:02,799
Woody, woody, woody,       
     take it easy.

317
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,651
Don't let lilith           
     hyperventilate, there.

318
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,487
[Both puffing]

319
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,506
[exclaims]

320
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,476
good boy.

321
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,463
Obviously, miss howe,   
        things are quite hectic 
        around here.

322
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,915
I better come back     
         in another 100 years.

323
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,100
No, no, no!                    
 It's not hectic here.          
 It-it's all this

324
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:23,720
faking heart attacks,  
         and giving birth,      
         and illegal gambling.

325
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,389
Illegal gambling?              
                     Nothing.

326
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,391
We better get out of here.     
 Let's go.

327
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,360
[Sighing]

328
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,429
i parked my car in that        
 damn red zone 1,000 times,

329
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,497
they pick today                
 to tow my car away.

330
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,334
Listen, i got my car   
         outside here.

331
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:37,501
I'll give you a lift.

332
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,669
Let me help--          
         let me help you.

333
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:40,120
All right, dear.               
 Just be brave.

334
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:42,155
Think lovely, simple,          
 wonderful thoughts.

335
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:43,223
[Groans]

336
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,691
novocaine.

337
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,993
Codeine.

338
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:48,662
Demerol. Whoa!

339
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,981
Whiskey. Rum. Whoa!

340
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,467
Knock me unconscious       
     with a mallet!

341
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:03,960
How far apart              
     are the contractions now?

342
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,879
Well, let's see.               
 They, uh, they were 3 minutes.

343
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,448
Uh, now they're...

344
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:09,616
about 40 minutes?

345
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:12,336
I think they've stopped,       
 frasier.

346
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,040
Oh, darn, too bad. I mean, 
     you were in such pain      
     there for a while.

347
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,727
It was false labor.            
 We made this trip for nothing.

348
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:22,146
Well, uh, why don't we wait    
 for the doctor to confirm it?

349
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,548
In the meantime, you just try  
 to stay comfortable.

350
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,600
How?                           
 There's no air conditioning,

351
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:30,254
i've got 50 pounds         
     of baby flesh              
     crushing a major artery,

352
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,222
and i want to go home.

353
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,860
Well, you know what they say.  
 That's the first sign          
 you're getting better.

354
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:37,427
Attagirl.

355
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,831
Oh, i'm sorry.                 
 I didn't mean to intrude.

356
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,232
Oh, no problem.

357
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,567
[Gasps]

358
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,035
[woman groans]

359
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,938
40 seconds.

360
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:48,889
Whoa, excuse me,

361
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:50,691
but shouldn't, uh,         
     somebody be here with you?

362
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:53,193
Oh, no,                        
 i'm being taken care of.

363
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,878
The doctor comes in            
 every few minutes

364
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:56,447
and tells me                   
 it's not that bad.

365
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,781
[Grunting]

366
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,851
well, are you          
         all alone here?

367
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,104
My husband's                
    in the merchant marines.

368
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:05,906
My parents                 
     live in michigan.

369
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:09,360
We just moved here.        
     I don't even know          
     anybody in boston.

370
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,462
Well, hell,             
        you do now. Sam malone.

371
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,631
Oh. Gail aldrich.          
     Ooh! Ooh! Oh, god!

372
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,700
I've never felt pain       
     like this.

373
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,169
Oh! Sorry!

374
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:22,356
Oh. There's another one.       
 They're coming closer.

375
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:24,407
Uh, shoot. Uh, frasier?

376
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:27,344
Say, uh, can you come      
     over here and help us      
     with that breathing stuff?

377
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,931
Darling, i'll be right back.   
 In the meantime, you just try  
 to think of good things.

378
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,299
[Gail screams] 
                     like what?

379
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:33,934
Well, like you're not her.

380
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,839
All right, now, uh,            
 the--the important thing       
 is to relax.

381
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,091
Uh, try to find                
 a focal point.                 
 Something to concentrate on.

382
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,176
All right, good.   
             Let's look for     
             something pretty.

383
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:44,394
Well, it could be anything.

384
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:45,445
Beige walls.   
 Something pretty.

385
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,364
Sam has a nice smile.

386
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:50,568
Oh. Oh, good, good, good.      
 Sam, yes.                      
 Uh, focus on sam's smile.

387
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,086
Yeah.                          
             All right.

388
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,037
You know, sam, you--           
 you do have a lovely smile.

389
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,642
Is that-- did you have     
     those bonded?

390
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,695
No, no, but i, uh,      
        i do have 'em polished  
        4 times a year.

391
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:04,081
4? No, i only go twice a year. 
 But maybe i should step it up.

392
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,699
[Gail gasping]

393
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:08,118
good, you're here.             
 Listen, the contractions       
 are one on top of another.

394
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:09,253
Ready to go, huh?

395
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,288
You bet i am.                  
 Oh, you probably mean her.

396
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,107
Ok, it's starting.

397
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:17,210
Let's get you          
         to the delivery room.  
            Oh, ok. Ok.

398
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:20,164
Oh, boy. Oh, it's hard      
    to get out of this bed.

399
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:23,000
Really? I wonder where  
        a guy like me could get 
        one of those, huh?

400
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,470
Smile. Smile.

401
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,672
Here we go.                    
         We're with you, now.   
         We're with you.

402
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,940
I'll be right back, hon.   
     Uh, will you be all right?

403
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,326
Sure.

404
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,229
I'm just counting          
     the tiny holes             
     in the ceiling tiles.

405
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,116
Of course, now that        
     you've interrupted me,

406
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,784
i'm going to have to       
     start all over.

407
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,037
That's my girl.

408
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:49,059
1, 2, 3, 4--

409
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,529
oh, doctor, thank god.         
 I felt so isolated here.

410
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:55,882
I guess i had false labor.     
 I'm just so                    
 terribly embarrassed

411
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,986
because i'm a doctor myself    
 and i was so sure              
 this was the real thing.

412
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:01,822
Not to mention the fact        
 that i was sure                
 i'd become a mother today

413
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:04,124
and now i have             
     to go on waiting.          
     I need someone

414
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:07,794
to talk me through this,    
    and please, please,         
    tell me what to do.

415
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:09,362
False labor. Go home.

416
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:22,843
Telephoned your parents,       
 told 'em you had a boy.        
 They were thrilled to death.

417
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,646
Great.     
 Although your father did       
 ask twice who the hell i was.

418
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,715
Thanks. You were both  
         so sweet.

419
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,951
Yeah, but i'm sweeter, 
         right?                 
             Oh.

420
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:35,172
If you'll excuse me,       
     i can't wait to share      
     this miracle with lilith.

421
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,007
Ooh! Oh, well, i'd better      
 not disturb her now.

422
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,943
She and the baby           
     are resting, so, uh...

423
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,427
whoa!

424
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,164
Who is that?

425
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,332
Your son.

426
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,067
My son?

427
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,253
A boy?

428
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,322
I'm the father. I'm a-- 
        sam, sam, i have a son!

429
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,342
Congratulations.   
             It looks just      
             exactly like me.

430
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,262
Oh, don't worry about that. 
    All babies look like that   
    at first.

431
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,514
May i?

432
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:07,254
Oh, look, sam, my son. 
                     Hello.

433
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:10,357
Oh, frasier,       
             he has your eyes.

434
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:13,593
And look at that,  
             he has--he has     
             lilith's chin.

435
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:15,629
And he's got my nose.  
     Oh, don't be ridiculous.

436
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,397
No, no. I mean,    
             he's got my nose.

437
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,465
Oh.

438
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:23,904
Oh. Whoo!

439
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,889
Look, he's so cute.    
                Mmm.

440
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,057
I could stare at him   
         for hours.

441
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,944
Sam?        
     Oh, i gotta go. Sorry.

442
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:36,433
You all set here?              
 Yeah, just give me 2 minutes   
 to get out of my uniform.

443
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,952
2 minutes, you kiddin'?        
 I can cut that time in half.

444
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,873
I can't believe 
                we have a son.

445
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,325
But, lilith, when did  
         all this happen?

446
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:46,726
After the doctor            
    discharged me,

447
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:49,596
i looked for you,           
    couldn't find you,          
    so i took a cab.

448
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,365
I gave birth               
     in the back seat.

449
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,652
The cabbie was nice enough     
 to let me bite down

450
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,987
on one of his              
     foam-rubber dice.

451
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:04,428
Oh, my precious angel, 
         you were so brave.

452
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,497
The only problem was           
 that every time i pushed,

453
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,832
my feet kept opening           
 the back door into traffic.

454
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:15,222
The greatest moment    
         of my life,            
         and i--i missed it.

455
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,856
You must           
             want to kill me.

456
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,226
Now, frasier, now is not       
 the time for reproaches.

457
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,977
Now is the time to rejoice.

458
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,562
The reproaches             
     can come tomorrow

459
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,964
and for the next 50 years.

460
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,334
Is it any wonder   
             i love you so?

461
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,406
Oh, look,

 much as we would like          
 to believe otherwise,

463
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:38,161
we both know                   
 that newborn infants           
 are incapable

464
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,763
of revealing emotion           
 through facial expression.

465
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:43,283
It's probably just gas.

466
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:45,402
(Both)                     
     oh, his first gas.

468
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,161
hey, norm.

470
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:58,782
frasier and lilith had a boy.  
                    All right!

471
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,534
Yeah, i got some pictures      
 here. You wanna see 'em?       
             Yeah, let's see.

472
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:02,902
Hmm.

473
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:06,273
Let's see here. All right,     
 uh, well, this is the nurse.

474
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,444
Nurse.

475
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:12,212
Nurse.                 
                    Ooh.

476
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,697
Me and the nurse.

477
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,567
All right, now,                
 here's one with the kid.

478
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,068
Where's the kid?

479
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,220
The fuzzy thing                
 that nurse is bending over.

480
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:25,692
Where is everybody?

481
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,594
Oh, well, the party kind of 
    got out of hand

482
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:30,030
after rebecca wrestled 
         the 5:00 news guy      
         to the ground

483
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,065
and ripped all the tape 
        out of his camera.

484
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,585
What about, cliff,             
 how's he doing?

485
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,121
I think they're still       
    interrogating him downtown. 
 Oh.

486
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,290
But carla went after him.  
 Bail him out?

487
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,242
No, to poke things at him  
     through the bars.

488
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,696
But don't worry, sammy.    
     I've watched the bar.

489
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:49,183
I've kept very careful track   
 of how many beers i've had.

490
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,350
Yeah.

491
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,868
I think this is, um,

492
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,754
2.             
 Yeah, right.

493
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:59,592
Sammy, think you can show me   
 how to change a keg?

494
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,466
So you're                      
 all alone here, huh?           
         Well, no, not exactly.
