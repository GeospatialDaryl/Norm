2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,900
    Sam.                        

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,100
  Sorry, they were out of beer  
nuts and pretzels at the store, 

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,900
     but guess what I got?      

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
          Choco Puffs.          

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,300
Hey-hey.                        
                 Hey, all right.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,700
    Haven't had these           
    since I was a kid.          

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,100
                          CLIFF:
              Hey, look at this.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,100
Uh, "90% real sugar,            
ten percent animal fat."        

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,000
God bless America, huh?         

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,800
I always liked eating mine      
straight from the box.          

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,100
They still have prizes          
in these things?                

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
                 Boy, I hope so.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,900
                 I remember when
                    I was a kid,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,600
        I got one of those lick-
         and-stick tattoo books.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,500
         Never wore them though.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,700
    Felt pretty silly, huh?     

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,300
            No, I'm just waiting
         for a special occasion.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,200
             Yep, I got a prize.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
Me, too. Dumb BB game.          

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
    Yeah, I got one of those    
      cheap plastic rings.      

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
              Oh, great, another
                    tattoo book.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
    (coughs)                    

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,200
                  Let's see what
                    Cliffie got.

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,700
    (coughs)                    

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
    Hey, Cliffie got skunked.   

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,400
                      (laughing)

28
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,900
(coughing, whistling)           

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
(coughing, whistling)           

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,500
                  Oh, Mr. Clavin
                got the whistle.

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,300
(coughing, whistling)           

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,200
      (theme song begins)       

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,600

      in the world today       

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,900
 Takes everything you've got  

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,500
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,000
 Sure would help a lot         

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,900
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,400
   Sometimes you want to go    

39
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,900
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,800
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,100
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,700
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,000
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,100
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,400
   People are all the same     

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,000
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

48
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,200
How's your throat               
doing there, Cliffie?           

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,300
 It's still a little sore, Sam. 

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,600
                    Oh, well,   

51
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,500
             here's something we
        used to do in my family.

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
        Ah! Ah!                 

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
 You did that for sore throats? 

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
                        No.     

55
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,200
    Sam...                      

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,400
        What...?                

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
  My hatcheck girl is missing   
         from her post.         

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,500
You haven't perchance seen her? 

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,100
 What's that supposed to mean?  
Every time something goes wrong 

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
    in your restaurant          
         it's my fault?         

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Like I'm the one who's supposed 
         to keep track          

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
     of all your employees?     

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,300
        You know,               
that really ticks me off.       

64
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,400
 Sam, I can't get the sofa bed  
        to fold back up.        

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,100
        Miss Kenderson.         

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,700
For the three weeks             
you've been in my employ        

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
as a hatcheck girl, you've spent
 most of your time downstairs.  

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,900
 Today, as luck would have it,  

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
we actually had a customer      
          with a hat.           

70
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,500
      And where were you?       

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
    Taking a break.             

72
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,400
It wasn't your break time.      

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,100
                    It was mine.

74
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
        Miss Kenderson,         
    you're terminated.          

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
 Get your things and clear out. 

76
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,300
    Fine.                       

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,100
Sam, in the future,             
I'd appreciate you              

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,300
keeping your hands off          
my hatcheck girls.              

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,700
        You know,               
  it's your own stupid fault.   

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,100
    I mean, I wouldn't touch    
      your hatcheck girls       

81
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
 if you'd hire some waitresses. 

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,800
          Hello, all.           

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,600
Happy birthday, Dr. Crane.      

84
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,000
     Why, thank you, Woody.     

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,500
    How did you know?           

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,200
Well, you left your wallet here 
          last night,           

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
  so I was looking through it   
to find out whose it was.       

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
  Are you really gonna donate   
      your internal organs      

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,600
            in case of accident?

90
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,900
        They take them before   
              you die, you know.

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
         Yeah, my uncle was just
             in a fender bender.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,700
            They chased him half
             way down the block.

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,300
        Well, thank you         
    for sharing that with me    

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
    on my, uh, special day.     

95
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
                So, you got some
                big plans, here?

96
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,700
    Oh, nothing much.           

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,100
  I've never been one of those  
who tend to make a big brouhaha.

98
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,200
    As my mother always used    
          to tell me,           

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
      "Don't get excited.       

100
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
     It's just another day      
         of the year."          

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
              You're kidding me,
        you never had parties   
            when you were a kid?

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
                Friends over?   
            Cakes? Ice cream?   

103
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,700
              No.               

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,600
  Well, once I had a... a bran  
muffin with a pat of oleo.      

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
        Hey, you know something,
             hey, I got an idea.

106
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,400
             Let's throw Frasier
              a party here, huh?

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,200
      You know, the bash that he
     never had, what do you say?

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
    Yeah. Great idea.           
         (all agreeing)         

109
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,300
     Afternoon, everybody.      

110
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,800
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

111
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,600
 What's going on, Mr. Peterson? 

112
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,800
         Another layer          
     for the winter, Wood.      

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
             CLIFF:             
    Hey, Norm, did you hear?    

114
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,200
    We're gonna have a big,     
    uh, birthday bash there     

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,900
 for Doc Fras.                  
                    Yeah, great.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,300
         Hey, it'll be exciting,
                Mr. Peterson.   

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
                We're gonna have
             cake and ice cream.

118
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,600
Yeah, we can go crazy and order 
from Pizza-Pizza-Pizza-Pizza.   

119
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,400
                Oh, what do they
                    serve there?

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
Pizza, you dweeb.               

121
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,000
            You don't have to   
            bite my head off.   

122
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,200
                 I've never been
                there before.   

123
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,100
             I don't know, guys.

124
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,800
             I'm just not in the
            mood for a party.   

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,300
            I got some bad news.
What?                           

126
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,900
              Vera lost her job.

127
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
         (all groaning)         
                          CLIFF:
                  Her, too, huh?

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
      Boy, this recession       
     is hitting everybody.      

129
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,700
  Well, they should have gone   
          for the gold          

130
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,700
    and gotten the security     
      of a government job.      

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
      Yeah, I'll tell you,      

132
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,000
I could spit on that mail       
  and chuck it down the sewer,  

133
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,400
and they couldn't fire me.      

134
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,200
                 How do you know
            that, Mr. Clavin?   

135
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,400
        I-I don't.              

136
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,600
 How about those Celtics, huh?  

137
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
It's too bad, man,              
about Vera losing her job.      

138
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
                        NORM:   
                        Yeah.   

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,100
         We have, like, no money
            coming in at all.   

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,500
  If something doesn't happen   
soon, I may have to find a job. 

141
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,200
 You gonna work, Norm?          

142
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,400
                I mean for Vera.

143
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,700
         "You gonna work, Norm?"

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
        Hi, guys.               

145
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
                    Oh, Rebecca,
                  there you are.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
  I've been looking everywhere  
            for you.            

147
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
  What are you talking about?   

148
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
You're just sitting there       
    on your bar stool.          

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
            I know.             
This is where I look from.      

150
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,800
So what do you need, Norm?      

151
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,000
        Well, it's Vera.        

152
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,200
     She was, uh, laid off      
down at the travel agency.      

153
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,200
 Oh, so you want me to see if I 
can use my corporate connections

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
    to get her another job?     

155
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,100
                    No.         

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
  You want me to help her out   
 with some professional resume? 

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
            Well, no.           

158
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,500
    What do you want, Norm?     

159
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
             Well, you see,     

160
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,900
Vera ripped off a bunch of these
    frequent flyer vouchers.    

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,900
 And I was wondering if I could 
 trade them in for free beers.  

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
    (scoffs)                    

163
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,100
                     What? What?

164
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,200
         Okay, somebody's got to
          go get all this stuff.

165
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,500
            I want ice cream,   
        balloons, decorations...

166
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,900
I nominate Frasier.             

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
I second.                       
             All in favor.      

168
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,700
              ALL:              
              Aye!              

169
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,600
You guys are the greatest.      

170
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
      Let the party begin.      

171
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,900
The birthday boy is here,       
and I've got the balloons.      

172
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
             CARLA:             
 Hey, congratulations, Frasier, 

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,100
             on a job well done.

174
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,900
Well, thank you                 
very much.                      

175
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
I'll, uh,                       
be right back, Sam.             

176
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,500
    Ah... I love birthdays.     

177
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
                        PETE:   
                            Hey.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
Isn't that                      
that French guy                 

179
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,500
who's trying to steal           
Woody's girlfriend?             

180
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
        Ah, yeah,               
        what a slimebag.        

181
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,100
Yeah, the man's got             
the morals of a snake.          

182
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,200
              I can believe he'd
          show his face in here.

183
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
        Hello, fellows.         

184
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
 Hey.                           
          Hey, Henri,           
    how're you doing?           

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
HENRI:                          
Ah, Woody.                      

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,300
          Let's hurry           
     and take your picture.     

187
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
    I have plans, huh?          

188
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
            Oh, yeah, I know.   

189
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,200
            You want to steal   
                  my girlfriend.

190
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,200
No. I could never take          
Kelly away from you.            

191
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,000
Why, just this morning,         
Kelly was telling me            

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,900
how much she loves you.         

193
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,500
                    Really?     
  Yes.                          

194
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,300
It got so annoying, I almost had
to kick her out of the shower.  

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
                 Is that a joke?

196
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,800
Ah! But of course.              

197
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
      (laughing)                

198
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,000
    Are you ready?              

199
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,000
          Yeah, I-I just shaved.
             How's my face look?

200
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,300
Mm, as smooth as your girlfriend
        Kelly's bottom.         

201
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,700
                 Is that a joke?

202
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,500
          (laughing):           
      But of course it is.      

203
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,300
 You have to shave much closer. 

204
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,300
        (laughing)              

205
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Where is this, uh, this,        
uh, American sense of humor     

206
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,100
I've heard so much about?       

207
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,900
             Uh, bring me a soda
          and pay for it, Woody.

208
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
             Woody,             

209
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,200
you don't even                  
like this man.                  

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,300
    He's been bothering you     
        ever since              

211
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,400
  he followed your girlfriend   
        back from Paris.        

212
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,900
And now you're paying him       
    to photograph you?          

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,100
        Well, he just borrows   
        money from me anyway.   

214
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,500
  This way I don't have to worry
    about him paying me back.   

215
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,500
      It's good you worked      
        that out, Woody.        

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,900
Yeah, besides, this is the first
 formal picture I've had taken  

217
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,300
 since my high school yearbook. 

218
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,500
    I hated that one.           

219
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,600
                 Darned cowlick.

220
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, yeah, when your hair        
all stands up like that?        

221
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,300
                Uh-uh.          

222
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,600
              Sam?              

223
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,300
A thought occurs.               

224
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
                            Mmm?

225
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
I always have such trouble      
      trying to figure out      

226
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,600
    what to get Frasier         
     for his birthday.          
                         Mm-hmm.

227
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,900
      Do you think perhaps      
 he'd like a photograph of me?  

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
                      Why?      

229
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,300
                    I mean...   

230
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
             Of course he would.

231
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,700
      Why would any man not want
          a picture of his wife?

232
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,700
                        I agree.

233
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,600
        A picture of you        
    is what every man wants.    

234
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,800
May I have the honor            
of taking it?                   

235
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,000
            Well, perhaps.      

236
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,800
            But I must warn you.

237
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
            I've had bad luck   
             with photographers.

238
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,800
            It seems they always
            overexpose the film,

239
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,100
          and I come out looking
            white as a ghost.   

240
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,600
     Oh.                        

241
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,300
I could put roses               
in your cheeks.                 

242
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,600
And then afterward, maybe       
I could photograph you.         

243
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,500
Why don't you                   
come this way?                  

244
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,900
    Uh, what do you think you   
    would like to be wearing?   

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,100
          Uh... an evening gown?

246
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
             A black lace teddy?

247
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
        My strong male hands?   

248
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,800
 I wasn't thinking of anything  
        like that.              

249
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, come on, Lil,               
loosen up.                      

250
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,300
Let him snap you                
in some lingerie.               

251
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,700
Guys love dirty pictures        
of their babes.                 

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,900
Hey, Nick always used           
to take them of me              

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
until one time I smashed        
his camera and broke his nose.  

254
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,600
  Oh, you got in a fight, huh?  

255
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
No, fell off                    
the monkey bars.                

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,100
Thank you, Carla.               

257
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Uh, I was thinking more         
of a photograph of me           

258
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,300
he could put                    
in his office.                  
                Mm-hmm.         

259
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
A nice formal portrait.         

260
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,100
         Ah, with just a hint of
        smoldering sensuality   

261
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,900
    dancing behind your eyes.   

262
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,800
Well, that goes                 
without saying.                 

263
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,500
    Well, uh, let's just take   
        a few test shots, uh?   

264
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Just to, uh, loosen you up      
before we go back to the studio?

265
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,700
Okay.                           

266
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,100
  Hey, I thought you were here  
      to take <i>my</i> picture.       

267
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,300
And I thought I ordered a soda. 

268
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,700
     You got a point there.     

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,700
Okay, okay.                     

270
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Good. Serious.                  

271
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,900
    Happy. Seductive.           

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,100
        Angry. Playful.         

273
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
     Have you ever modeled      
        professionally?         

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
          Goodness no.          

275
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,900
    Oh, I know you're lying.    

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
      Come, let's go back       
         to the studio.         

277
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
                      <i>Tres bien.</i>

278
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,900
      <i>Como?</i>                     

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,100
        You said, "Let's go back
                 to the studio,"

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,700
        and I said, <i>"Tres bien."</i>

281
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,600
No, I'm sorry,                  
I don't understand this.        

282
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,700
                      <i>Tres bien.</i>

283
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,500
Ah, oh, <i>"Tres bien"!</i>            

284
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,700
                 I see I'm going
            to have to teach you

285
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,200
              the French tongue.

286
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,900
 Hey, Henri, I have your soda.  

287
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,000
             Henri?             

288
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,300
Woody, he left.                 

289
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,000
        Well, all right,        
 then I'll just drink his soda. 

290
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
      No, I can't do that.      

291
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,500
      That would be wrong.      

292
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
        Hi, guys.               

293
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,500
            Rebecca!            

294
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
    How did it go with Vera?    

295
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
         It went great.         
        I just love her.        

296
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,300
        And guess what?         

297
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
      I think I landed her      
    a pretty good job.          

298
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
            You're joking.      
No, no,                         
I still have the touch.         

299
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
 I helped her with her resume.  
        Where is she working?   

300
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,100
     Then I got her prepped     
    for the interview.          
            Where's she working?

301
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
    I even loaned her           
        my lucky scarf.         

302
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,600
                 Yeah, but where
                 is she working?

303
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,600
             VERA:              
             Norm!              

304
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
                     Vera!      

305
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,600
                    What are you
                 doing up there?

306
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,300
             VERA:              
    Check your hat, Mister?     

307
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,100
          (screaming)           

308
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,400
 I'll, uh, I'll be right back.  

309
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
    Hey, Norm, we need you.     

310
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
Pete just hit a bull's-eye      
        and doubled off.        

311
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
     You're our last hope.      

312
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,500
             Norm?              

313
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,500
     Norm?                      

314
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
                 She's up there.

315
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,200
        What?                   

316
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,900
                Listen.         

317
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
     (steps thudding above)     
                  You hear that?

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
      Hear what?                

319
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
                    Vera.       

320
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,700
             She's crossing over
          to the coffee machine.

321
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,200
            No, wait, they could
            be moving the piano.

322
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,500
            Nah, it's her.      

323
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,500
         Come on, man.          
            I know that walk.   

324
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,900
    You can't hear her          
     all the way up there.      

325
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
              I wish I couldn't,
                Sam, believe me,

326
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,800
                but that walk is
        burned into my brain.   

327
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,200
                I've heard it   
                  in snow boots.

328
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,300
    I've heard it in flip-flops.

329
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,600
                I've heard it   
                in bare feet.   

330
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,100
    Click-click, click-click,   
                    click-click.

331
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,700
Let the birthday fun begin, Sam!

332
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
    The balloons have           
     entered the building.      

333
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,500
    Say, where are the guys?    

334
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,900
They're in the poolroom.        

335
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,300
     Oh, jeez, I'm missing      
          all the fun           

336
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,300
at my own birthday party.       

337
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
    Hey, wait up guys!          

338
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
                 Hey, be careful
                     back there.

339
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
    The dart tournament started.

340
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,700
    (balloons popping)          

341
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
        I hate this bar.        

342
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
    Norm, Vera's doing          

343
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
  a really good job up there.   

344
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
     She is just terrific!      

345
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,500
And funny!                      
Listen to this.                 

346
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,500
 How many fat guys does it take 
     to change a lightbulb?     

347
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,800
                I don't know.   

348
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,600
    You can't get a fat guy     
     to change a lightbulb.     

349
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
     You can't even get him     
          to come home          

350
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,900
    on Christmas Eve.           

351
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
(laughing hysterically)         

352
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,700
Oh, she was telling             
some real cute stories          

353
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,700
about you, too, Norm.           

354
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,900
Hey, why didn't you ever tell us

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
that your real first name       
          was Hilary?           

356
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
    Oh, who cares about that?   

357
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
        Hey, guys!              

358
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
     Norm's real first name     
        is Hilary!              

359
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,400
                      (laughing)
      Hey, wait a minute.       

360
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,200
Isn't that a girl's name?       

361
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,700
                Hilary was my   
              grandfather's name

362
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,000
    and he once killed a man    
      who laughed at him.       

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,100
        What, he just up        
      and killed somebody       

364
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,200
for laughing at his name?       

365
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
                    Not exactly.
            He was a surgeon.   

366
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
He sort of botched an operation.

367
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,600
Norm, you don't have            
to be defensive.                

368
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,300
I think Hilary's a very         
masculine name.                 

369
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
In fact,                        

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
I think you ought to have it    
monogrammed on your purse.      

371
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
      Let the party begin!      

372
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,800
All right!                      

373
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,100
You got the balloons, huh?      

374
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,900
      Well, actually, no.       

375
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,200
They were out of balloons.      

376
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
    Fortunately, a colleague    
    of mine was kind enough     

377
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,600
        to give me a box        
      of surgical gloves.       

378
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,000
        If you can't have a good
            time with four dozen

379
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,600
     rubber inflated hands,     
    you're just not trying.     

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,400
              Frasier, I've been
                waiting for you.

381
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
     Happy Birthday.            

382
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,200
          Well, darling, for me?

383
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,600
Now, Frasier,                   

384
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,300
you know that in the past       

385
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,000
some of my birthday             
presents to you                 

386
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
have been a little dull.        

387
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
So, this year, I decided        
to try something                

388
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,100
a little more adventurous.      

389
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,400
I thought to myself,            

390
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,900
"What would my husband think    

391
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
of a provocative photograph     
of his demure wife              

392
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,800
stretched out languidly         
on a bearskin rug?"             

393
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
              ALL:              
        Whoo-hoo!               

394
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,700
                  Lilith, surely
                  you're joking.

395
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,100
    I am not.                   

396
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,300
 (bar patrons whistle and howl) 

397
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,900
                Whoo!           

398
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,400
             Well, you're right.

399
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
            That certainly is   
                 a bearskin rug.

400
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
     And that is definitely you.

401
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,500
                 Oh, how erotic.

402
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
              I guess we'll have
          to keep the negatives.

403
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,500
          We'd hate to have them
          falling into the hands

404
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
                of <i>Fully Dressed</i>
             <i>Woman's Monthly.</i>   

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,100
Frasier, you're forgetting      
what a cheeky monkey I can be.  

406
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,800
It's a gag gift.                

407
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
If you wanted us to gag,        

408
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,600
you should have                 
taken a nudie.                  

409
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,200
    Well, you're right, darling.

410
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,300
             And it's hilarious.

411
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,500
        I'll be sure to put this
        right up in my workshop.

412
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,800
You don't have a workshop.      

413
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
                Then I'll put it
                  in the closet.

414
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,500
By the way...                   

415
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
here are the rest               
of the photographs              

416
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,500
from the session.               

417
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,800
    Why, Lilith, these are...   

418
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,400
      You, you're practically...

419
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,400
        You're only wearing a...

420
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,600
              Oh, baby, baby!   

421
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,600
Happy birthday, Frasier.        

422
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,600
Would you like to go home       
     and get a better look      

423
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,200
    at those?                   
                I sure would.   

424
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,700
      Oh, uh, you can come, too.

425
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,300
                Well, that's it.

426
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,700
                I'm out of here.

427
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,900
      "Out of here"?            

428
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Norm, it's 9:30.                
It's not closing time.          

429
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,800
                        NORM:   
                         I know.

430
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,400
    I'm still leaving.          

431
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,100
Oh, well, I'll drive you,       
          then, okay?           

432
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,400
            No-no-no, I don't   
                    need a ride.

433
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,100
                I didn't even   
                 have any beers.

434
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,500
  I hope you're happy, woman.   

435
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
    Look, guys, uh...           

436
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,300
          I can't keep          
      hanging around here.      

437
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,700
      Knowing that <i>she's</i>        
        up there just...        

438
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,000
 spoils the whole thing for me. 

439
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
    I'll have to find           
     another bar, I guess.      

440
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,000
     I don't believe this!      

441
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,000
      You're just gonna up      
     and walk out of here?      

442
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, I'm gonna say something that

443
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
I thought I'd never say, but... 

444
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,200
    dibs on the first stool!    

445
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
         Hey, come on!          

446
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Listen, Cheers wouldn't be      
      Cheers without you.       

447
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,400
            You're the reason   
        why people come here.   

448
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,800
        Oh, what people?        

449
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,000
              Well, the delivery
                man, for one.   

450
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,500
         (Norm screams)         

451
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
        She's up there.         

452
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
    She's everywhere.           

453
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,400
    Is she like multiplying?    

454
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,300
             Vera?              
(Vera crying)                   

455
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,500
         Are you okay?          

456
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Norm...                         

457
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,600
  Rebecca, have I thanked you   

458
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,300
         for sending me         
     the new hatcheck girl?     

459
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100
     No, John, you haven't.     

460
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,300
    Well, here's why.           

461
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
She was worse                   

462
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
    than the last one           
        and I fired her.        

463
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,900
  Hey, do you want to tell me   
      why you fired Vera?       

464
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,000
                    Who are you?
     I'm her husband, Norm.     

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
                Oh, yes.        

466
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,400
              I didn't recognize
            you without a bar   

467
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,700
      growing out of your chest.

468
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
            Well, I fired her   
              because she wasn't

469
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
                paying attention
                    to her work.

470
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,200
  What are you talking about?   

471
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,000
          She's a very          
     conscientious worker.      

472
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,300
  How would you describe a woman
         who spends all her time

473
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,100
  on her hands and knees looking
through a knothole in the floor?

474
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,300
        I knew it!              

475
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,600
            Yep, there it is!   

476
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
There it is!                    

477
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
My good man,                    
you have my sympathy.           

478
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,000
To be married to her            
must be quite an ordeal.        

479
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,700
            Hey, take that back!

480
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,700
    What?                       
                 Take that back!

481
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,300
            You're talking about
            the woman I love!   

482
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
         I want you to take that
          back before I turn you

483
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
                 into a pretzel!

484
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,600
Well, that's a shape            
I'm sure you're familiar with.  

485
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,400
            I am not kidding!   

486
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,800
All right, all right.           

487
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I take it back. I apologize.    

488
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,100
                All right.      

489
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
    Now just go on back upstairs

490
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,700
              before I pound you
        into a... a beer nut!   

491
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,100
Well, thank you.                
I'm tiring of the theme.        

492
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
                Wow! Norm,      
                that was sweet. 

493
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,900
     You stood up for your wife.
Shh, shh, shh.                  

494
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
                     No, no, no,
        don't be embarrassed.   

495
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,100
Everyone didn't see that,       
        did they?               

496
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,700
                      We saw it.

497
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
    I took a picture.           

498
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,300
      Norm, so what if they did?

499
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
         You're right.          

500
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,900
Listen, I joke around           
a lot, but...                   

501
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,600
      she's all I've got.       

502
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,400
    I don't know what I'd do    
          without her.          

503
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,200
          I love her.           

504
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,000
                That's sweet.   

505
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,200
                You know, she's,

506
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,800
        she's still up in the   
            stairwell crying.   

507
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,500
 Oh, I know. She'll, she'll go  
      away after a while.       

508
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,700
Yeah, there she goes.           

509
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,500
    You gotta love her!
