 circle the day in red.

00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:12,861
Today, lilith and i are off    
 on our first outing,           
 sans baby.

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,980
All right.                  
    Congratulations, frasier.

7
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:17,549
And well deserved, too.        
 I feel like a free man.

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,717
You know,                      
 you have no idea

00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,752
how an infant                  
 can dominate your life.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,621
Fortunately, lilith and i      
 have seen to it

11
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,890
that we can get away           
 and enjoy ourselves            
 independently.

12
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:26,591
Where you goin'?

13
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:28,042
First we're off                
 to the crib store              
 to buy a new liner

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,429
and then it's our              
 lamaze reunion.

15
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:31,495
W-w-wait,

16
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:34,081
so who's taking care   
         of the little papoose?

17
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,250
Oh, we've locked into          
 the most fabulous au pair.

18
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,320
You know, one of those         
 foreign exchange students

19
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,755
who in return                  
 for room and board             
 take care of the child.

20
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:43,741

 large, blond and from sweden.

        object to having

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,115
a spicy little         
         swedish meatball       
         around the house?

 being a mommy,

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,401
i don't think                  
 she's even noticed.

00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:56,504
Come on, frasier.

     you're 7 minutes late.

00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:58,550
Oh, boy,                    
    i wish i was more like you.

39
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,419
I just can't seem to find  
     the time to sit around,

40
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:04,789
watching the minutes tick by   
 while i get older,

41
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,292
realizing that         
         i've wasted my life.

42
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,096
I meant roughly 7.

43
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,166
So what's your excuse?

44
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,970
Well, i had a date last night  
 i was 7 minutes late for.

45
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,072
And i just could   
             never catch up.

46
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:26,394
And i suppose                  
 you didn't have time           
 to shave this morning.

47
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,262
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

48
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,831
Sure, you forgot.

49
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,734
It wouldn't happen             
 that you think                 
 that looks sexy, would it?

50
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,303
No, really.    
                 I just forgot.

 a thick crop of jaw hair.

 wasn't, uh, androcles the guy

56
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,555
who pulled the thorn   
         out of the lion's paw?

 when she found the scratches   
 on his back, eh.

I'm telling you, guys,         
 babes and beards.

59
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:04,399
Yeah? If beards are        
     such a babe magnet,

60
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,251
why don't you have one?

 carla,

00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:11,789

 i'm the first clavin           
 to go without a beard.

        to go without a tail.

 the old norelco a face ride,

67
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:22,901

    outshine sammy's.

 your peach fuzz                
 on the starting line?

     better to do than sit

     and watch my hair grow.

         this pathetic display?

90
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,670

 you're secure enough           
 in your masculinity

 these never ending             
 rites of passage.

92
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:20,441
No, no. I mean that this       
 convention of babies bottoms

93
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,060
think they can grow    
         better beards than me.

     small town guy             
     who's a little shy

137
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,432
and sort of backward.

138
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,367
Can you believe            
     they chose me?

139
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,004
Oh, this is really exciting.

140
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,073
The girl who's playing emily   
 is a terrific actress.         
                         Yeah?

141
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,644
I mean, actually               
 she's got kind of an advantage 
 'cause her real name is emily.

142
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,113
Ah.

143
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:42,049
She don't even have         
    to learn to answer          
    to a different name.

144
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:45,303
All right, i guess you'll be   
 doing all the real work,       
 then, eh?

145
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:49,056
Now, all i can say is          
 it's about time.

146
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:52,493
You've lugged coffee around 
    and sold tickets in that    
    theater long enough.

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,728
Just payin' my dues,   
         miss howe.

148
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,330
Boy,                        
    this is a big night for me.

149
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:58,116
Who wants to help me   
         paint the town?

150
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,567
(Norm)                 
         all right, let's go.

151
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,035
(Cliff)             
            where are we going?

152
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:02,920
To the theater.                
 I'm in charge of the scenery

153
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,939
and i've got to        
         paint the town.

154
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,782
[Crickets chirping]

155
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,268
charlie,                       
 you think my beard             
 makes--makes me look older?

156
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,770
Mmm, no.

157
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,605
Really?

158
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,974
Yeah, it's your hairline       
 that makes you look older.

159
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,745
Well, rebecca,              
    the contest is almost over.

160
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,748
You only got        
            about 24 more hours

161
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,951
to keep stealing those 
         subtle little glances  
         at me.

162
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,721
What are you talking about?

163
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,540
Oh, come on,   
                 i've seen you  
                 lookin' at me

164
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,209
over your shoulder 
             like.

165
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:43,878
A little ashamed but not       
 bein' able to stop yourself.

166
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,179
Yeah, right.

167
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,616
You look like you live         
 in the woods and chop trees.

168
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,452
In this fantasy of yours,      
 is my shirt on or off?

169
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,288
Oh, please.

170
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:56,257
With little droplets       
     of sweat running down      
     my well formed body

171
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,458
like rivers.

172
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:59,360
Don't make me laugh.

173
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,396
I saw that.

174
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,585
Sam, sam, get this.

175
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,954
Who do you think i look like   
 with my beard this way?

176
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,689
Oh, well, that's easy.

177
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:14,158
You look like that little guy  
 on the cans of deviled ham.

178
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,280
No, no.        
                 Sigmund freud.

179
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:21,049
The father                 
     of modern psychoanalysis

180
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,200
and one of the greatest    
     minds of the 20th century.

181
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,320
He gave all that up            
 to sell deviled ham?

182
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,741
The man had to live.

183
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,776
You know, lately,

184
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,278
when i'm in my office  
         taking notes

185
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,763
while some patient is  
         pouring his guts out,

186
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,667
i imagine i'm dr. Freud 
        and i'm back in vienna,

187
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:41,903
hobnobbing with the great  
     minds of the era,

188
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,871
exchanging quips with jung,

189
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,340
developing the original     
    theories of psychoanalysis.

190
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:49,310
You know, before i know it, 
    the hour's up.

191
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:53,014
I discover i haven't even  
     listened to a single thing 
     the patient's been saying.

192
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,649
It makes a nice change.

193
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,587
Evening, everybody.

194
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,789
(All)              
             norm.

195
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,091
What can i get you, norm?

196
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,626
Got any flea powder?

197
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:09,030
No. Just kidding.  
             Actually,

198
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,732
give me a beer.     
            I think i'll drown  
            the little suckers.

199
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,737
Your beard's looking good,  
    man.

200
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,988
It's filling in nicely.

201
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,558
Yeah, i gotta hand it      
     to you guys, you are good.

202
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,910
Not in the ball park    
        with nick tortelli,     
        though.

203
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:24,912
Eh?        
 Now that was a hairy man.

204
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,046
Yeah.

205
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:28,249
You know, the first time       
 i saw him naked,

206
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,585
i couldn't even tell           
 he was naked.

207
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,423
But then, who would            
 have expected it               
 at bob's big boy?

208
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,650
Oh, hide everybody. 
            Hide, hide.

209
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,384
It's the wolf man.

210
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,669
Oh, oh.

211
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:57,245
Oh, no, no.

212
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:59,747
Sorry, relax.      
             It's just cliff.

213
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,984
Very funny, norm.              
 Very funny.

214
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,520
Don't give up                  
 your day job, huh?

215
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:08,188
Oh, that's right.              
 You don't have a day job.

216
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:09,690
[All exclaiming]

217
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,241
all right, come on, cliff, 
     admit it.

218
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,761
The beard looks         
        a little pathetic, huh?

219
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,997
Apology accepted, norm.

220
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,483
You know, you guys,    
         tomorrow is woody's    
         opening night.

221
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,819
And he is really excited.      
 So, why don't we chip in--

222
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:24,405
[screaming]             
        wolf man.

223
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,092
I love that gag.

224
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,155
Emily, i'm gonna do my best.

225
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,024
I love you, emily.

226
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,476
I need you.

227
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,512
Well, if you love me--

228
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,114
wait, wait. Stop.

229
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:53,167
Woody, honey,              
     tomorrow is opening night.

230
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:55,752
I'm not getting love   
         from you.

231
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:58,088
Well, i really do              
 respect your work, sir.

232
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,176
Not for me. For emily.

233
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,611
When you say   
                 "i love you",

234
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:06,013
i don't believe you're         
 really talking to this girl.

235
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,115
Again, please.

236
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,285
I love you, emily.

237
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:12,920
No, no, no.

238
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,472
Ron, honey,                
     you wanna help woody       
     run lines for a minute?

239
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,374
Do i have to?

240
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,610
What kind                      
 of a theater is this, ron?

241
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,695
Community theater.

242
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:24,882
Come on, woody.

243
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,451
Emily, honey, we--we got       
 a little problem here.

244
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,055
Is it me? Because              
 i really felt connected        
 in that last run through.

245
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,675
Honey, you're the best 
         actress we have.

246
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,161
No. It's woody.

247
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,564
I--i think i may have       
    to replace him in the part.

248
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,798
Every time             
         he has to touch you,

249
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,566
or play anything           
     resembling a love scene,

250
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,967
he--he just freezes up.

251
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,020
Maybe, i can get him           
 to loosen up.

252
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,772
Oh, give it a try.

253
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,307
Suppose if you could get him   
 past that one little block,

254
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,960
then we could          
         be free to work on     
         all his other blocks.

255
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,314
I'll try, mr. Bradken.

256
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,616
Uh, woody, honey,      
         want to come back      
         center stage?

257
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,153
Emily is gonna work            
 with you a little longer.

258
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,840
Come on, ron. I need a lift    
 to my sister's up at the cape.

259
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,007
Do i have to?

260
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:08,241
Ron.

261
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,977
Community theater.

262
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,799
I don't know               
     what i'm doin' wrong.

263
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm centered.

264
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,735
I'm--i'm breathing     
         from my diaphragm.

265
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,170
I found my focal point.

266
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,022
I'm not chewing gum.

267
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,908
Why don't we try               
 improvising a little?

268
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,576
We'll get on our ladders

269
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,012
and we'll just say             
 whatever we think              
 our characters are thinking.

270
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,115
And remember,                  
 george and emily               
 are 2 innocent kids

271
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,816
playing around with love.

272
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,352
They're consumed by            
 the fire of their passion.

273
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,887
Don't you think?

274
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,908
Ok, i'll start.

275
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:48,966
It's a beautiful moon,     
     isn't it, woody?           
     I mean, george.

276
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,452
It sure is, emily.         
     I mean, emily.

277
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,125
I hate to waste

 to go into psychology.         
 He insisted on it.

You're in a play               
 and you didn't even tell me.

414
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,525
Wait, maybe i was          
     just cheating on you.

415
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,828
4,061.

416
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:28,282
4,062.

417
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,933
Wait,                       
    this is a misunderstanding.

418
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,235
(Emily)                
         yeah, listen to him.

419
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,536
(Kelly)

420
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,555
Huh, woody's babes             
 comin' to blows.

421
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,222
Cat fight.                     
             Cat fight.

422
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,758
(All)                  
         cat fight.

425
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:45,815
You do and i'll hurt           
 yours right back.

426
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,734
Kitten fight.

427
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:47,934
Kitten fight.                  
     Kitten fight.

428
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,205
Look,              
             i'm really sorry.

429
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:55,675
I-- when i get miffed, 
         the adrenaline         
         just goes crazy.

430
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,328
Kelly, i didn't tell you   
     about the play

431
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,664
because i thought          
     you might be uncomfortable

432
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,699
seeing me kiss and hug 
         another woman.

433
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,252
Oh, come on, woody.            
 I've seen plays before.

434
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,439
I can't believe                
 you didn't trust me            
 enough to understand.

435
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:12,192
I didn't want to take   
        the chance of somethin' 
        comin' in between us.

436
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,627
You're my girlfriend.

437
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,311
I love you, kelly.

438
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,564
Why can't you say it       
     to me like that?

439
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,384
Well, i don't love you. 
        I love kelly.

440
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,753
Can't you pretend i'm kelly?

441
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,804
Would that be ok,  
             kelly?

442
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:28,124
Well, all right,            
    but just for the play.

443
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,329
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,399
I--i just can't look you       
 in the eyes when i say that.

445
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,519
[Sighing]                      
 well, why don't you try        
 starting on something else?

446
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,254
Just say it to the air.

447
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,007
I love you, air.

448
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,475
Great.

449
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,861
All right,                     
 now say it to this guy.

450
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:49,879
I love you, tecumseh.

451
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,350
Hey, i'm starting           
    to get the hang of this.

452
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,868
I love you, miss howe.

453
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,703
Thank you, woody.

454
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,106
I love you, mr. Clavin.

455
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,593
Well, woody, it takes          
 quite a man to admit that.

456
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:05,612
I was just actin'.

457
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,046
Oh, yeah. So was i.

458
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,905
I'm starting to get this.

459
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,623
Now say it to me.

460
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,508
I love you, emily.

461
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,944
Oh, woody,

462
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:23,180
mr. Bradken said               
 that if you didn't             
 get over this,

463
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:24,831
he's gonna replace you         
 in the part.

464
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:26,500
I love you, emily.

465
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,389
So that's the secret   
         to acting. Fear.

466
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:35,692
So what other bad things   
     did he say about me?

467
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:37,578
[Chiming]

468
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,112
hear ye, hear ye.

469
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,097
Here are the results           
 you've all been waiting for.

470
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,966
And the winner is...

471
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,036
[snickering]                
    cliff clavin.

472
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,337
Oh, man.

473
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,272
Hey, hey,                  
     all right.

474
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,824
Well,                   
        we know it's not fixed.

475
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,208
But you should be.

476
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,581
Well, don't look at me,        
 you guys,

477
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,132
he passed all the tests.

478
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,251
Yep, i'm gonna go              
 call my barber.

479
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,954
Yeah, yeah,             
        yeah, yeah.

480
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,222
Tell him i won the contest

481
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,075
in spite of that inch          
 he trimmed off my beard.

482
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,476
Well, i suppose it's time      
 we shave.

483
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,110
Yeah.

484
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,846
To tell you the truth          
 i'm going to kind              
 of miss the old beard.

485
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,049
Yeah. I rather         
         enjoyed looking like

486
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:18,184
a macho, grizzly,  
             gnarly kind of guy

487
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,887
that my wife wouldn't  
         come near with         
         a 10 foot pole.

488
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,090
I, uh, i'd like     
            to talk to somebody

489
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:26,727
about one of your              
 industrial adhesive products.

490
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,247
So,                        
     what do you think?

491
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:32,649
Should i keep it           
     or lose it?

492
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,384
I know                     
     how sexy you think it is.

493
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,386
Well, you know, sam,   
         to tell you the truth,

494
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:39,422
i think, the sexiest part  
     about a beard is when      
     a man shaves it.

495
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,974
Oh, yeah?              
                 Mmm-hmm.

496
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,859
You know, i've always   
        had this little fantasy

497
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:44,628
about sitting      
             in a guy's lap,

498
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,264
and lathering him up   
         real good,

499
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:51,451
and taking it off, 
             taking it all off.

500
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,188
Well, what's the point      
    of having a fantasy         
    unless you make it real?

501
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,156
I agree. I'm gonna do it.

502
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:58,542
Oh, yeah?

503
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,611
Norm, can you come     
         in my office, please?

504
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,317
(Cliff) 
                        i see.

505
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,434
I see.

506
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:10,086
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

507
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,688
Uh-huh. Yeah, well,

508
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,123
just for the sake  
             of argument,

509
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,959
suppose it did come         
    in contact with human skin?

510
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,030
Now, can they do that   
        on an outpatient basis?

511
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:28,492
