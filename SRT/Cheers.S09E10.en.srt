00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,300
             CLIFF:             
        Oh-- here's Sam.        

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,700
CARLA: Oh, come on, Sammy.      
                    Hey, Sammy. 

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,600
        Sammy, open up.         
         It's freezing!         

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
              SAM:              
Hey, what are you guys standing 
          around for?           

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,600
    How come somebody           
    didn't let you in?          

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,800
             CARLA:             
      I left my keys home.      

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,600
SAM:                            
Oh, no, I was                   
counting on yours.              

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,900
                        REBECCA:
                     I left mine
                  in the office.

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,000
            Hurry up! It's cold!

11
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,100
         Well, how are          
     we gonna get in here?      

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,700
NORM:                           
'Morning, everybody.            
                  OTHERS: Norm! 

13
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,400
        (keys jangling)         
NORM:                           
Sorry I'm late.                 

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,900
      (theme song begins)       

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,800
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,900
 Takes everything you've got  

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,700
         Takin' a break        
    from all your worries      

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,600
 Sure would help a lot         

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,300
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,300
   Sometimes you want to go    

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,600
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,500
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,500
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,300
          The troubles         
    are all the same           

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,300
  You wanna be where everybody 
    knows your name            

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,900
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
   People are all the same     

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,600
  You wanna go where everybody 
    knows your name.

                    (grunts)    

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,500
      Sorry I took so long      
getting here this morning.      

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,400
          Sam, you know, this is
    the fourth time this week   

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,900
          that you've been late.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
  As a responsible businessman  
and the owner of this bar,      

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,100
     you owe it to yourself     
            to stick            

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
to a more responsible schedule, 
        you know.               

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
Absolutely.                     

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,700
If the post office ran          
its business the way            
you run yours...                

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
        Never mind.             

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,200
I have a good excuse this time. 

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
    I'm being treated           
      by a dermatologist.       

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,700
    Is it anything serious?     

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
         No, no, no...          
        I just told her         

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,800
that I had a patch of dry skin, 

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,600
and we stayed up all night      
        looking for it.         

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,300
Found it, too--                 
four times, by golly.           

47
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,900
         Sammy, uh, can we stick
to the topic at hand, please?   

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah, Sam. I don't mean to make 
    any threats here,           

49
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,700
  but Gary's Old Towne Tavern   
         already opens          

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
a half-hour before you do.      

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,100
 And how do we know that, Norm? 

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,000
                Hey, who's on   
                trial here, huh?

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
        Hey, everybody.         

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
         Hey, Woody...          

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,700
         You won't believe this.

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
        I just found out        
    that on cable TV,           

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,400
     they have this channel     
where they show you stuff       

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,200
  and you can buy it any hour   
of the day, any day of the week.

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,900
    How did we live before?     

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
          Yeah, yeah.           
    Home Shopping Channel--     

61
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,600
          Ma loves it,          
she's always watching it.       

62
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,900
 She's always saying, "If I had 
 a rich son, he'd buy me this,  

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
      If I had a rich son,      
    he'd buy me that."          

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,100
  Who do you think bought her   
the TV in the first place?      

65
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,800
         You, Cliffie?          

66
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
No, but if I find the guy,      

67
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,300
  I'm gonna shove that clicker  
        down his throat.        

68
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Look at this--                  
I already got my first package. 

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
             Yeah?              

70
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,300
         Huh?                   

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,500
It's a toy car...               

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,700
and also rewinds videotapes.    

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,300
    Now, uh, wouldn't a VCR     
         rewind tapes?          

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
    Uh, not the one I bought    
          last night.           

75
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,600
REBECCA:                        
Excuse me,                      

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,300
                          Carla.

77
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,900
Did you read my last memo?      

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,400
              No.               

79
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Well, if you had read it,       
         you would know         

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
that we are no longer accepting 
 time cards made out in pencil. 

81
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,600
                    From now on,

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
all paperwork must be done      
            in ink.             

83
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,600
                        Okay.   

84
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,300
Did you hear me?                

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Are you acknowledging my memo?  

86
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,900
                I heard you!    
                I acknowledge   
                  the damn memo!

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Now would you get out of my face
so I can finish this time card? 

88
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,900
    I mean, this isn't easy,    
        you know.               

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
          My pencil's           
    almost down to the nub.     

90
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,100
 Well, as long as you're aware  
        of the problem.         

91
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,200
Oy... that's something,         
eh, Norm?                       

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,800
Remember the good old days?     

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,100
When you used to be able to take
an argument like that           

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,500
between two gals and turn them  
into the Jets and the Sharks?   

95
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
         Tell you what, Cliffie,

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,500
              for you, I'm gonna
        tee it up one more time.

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
All right.                      
                     Watch this.

98
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,700
                    Rebecca, uh,

99
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,500
                  I noticed your
            little exchange with
            Carla over there,   

100
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,300
and I have to say, I admire     
your management technique.      

101
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,900
                  Thank you very
                     much, Norm.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,800
It takes a lot of courage,      
you know, to humiliate yourself 

103
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,400
just for the well-being         
of one employee.                

104
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,900
If you were a Japanese          
businessman,                    

105
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,700
I mean, to lose face like that, 
you'd probably have to          

106
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700
commit some sort                
of ritual suicide, you know?    

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,000
But here in America...          

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,300
                Carla!          

109
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,700
    Come in my office,          

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
      bring that time card      
        and a <i>pen.</i>              

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
                I'd better be   
                getting a raise.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
         (door closing)         

113
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
CLIFF:                          
Oh,                             

114
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
the master returns              
from his triumphal march        

115
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,200
to the valley of evil.          

116
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,800
         I got a raise.         

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,700
Frasier, darling,               
today is                        

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600
our monthly luncheon            
with the Psychoanalytic         

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
and Social Therapeutic          
Practitioners Society.          

120
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,000
Have you forgotten?             

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
        Well, let me finish this
            double, and I might.

122
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,500
Now, Doctor...                  

123
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
             Yeah, well, Lilith,
            I really can't stand

124
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,700
                    another dry,
                endless luncheon

125
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,600
                  in some stuffy
                 old restaurant.

126
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,000
                  Pretty boring,
                      huh, Fras?

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,100
                Well, let me put
            it this way, Sam.   

128
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,500
                Lilith is the   
                  Dorothy Parker

129
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
              of this particular
                     roundtable.

130
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,500
Come on, Frasier,               
let's go.                       

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
                All right, but I
                 won't enjoy it.

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,500
Hey, Norm, go ahead,            
make them fight.                

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,900
                      Oh, you do
                    it, come on.

134
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,300
        Me?                     
                    Yeah.       

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
                          CLIFF:
                  Hey, Fras, you
        think Carla should be   

136
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
filling out the time card       
with a pen or a pencil?         

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,500
    I can see                   

138
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,800
why you can't tear yourself     
away from this place.           

139
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,700
All right, all right,           
all right.                      

140
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,300
So I'm not you.                 

141
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,500
        Cliffie, come on now.   

142
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,700
                 Buck up, buddy.

143
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,000
             You're, you're just
                warming up here.

144
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,000
    You got to start out with   
         an easy one first, huh?

145
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,500
    Yeah.                       
                Look, there's...
                there's Paul!   

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
There's Paul.                   
                 Hey, Hey, Paul!

147
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,500
    Shut up, fathead!           

148
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300
        Hey, guys.              

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
                      Hey, Wood.

150
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,300
      Look what I just got      
    on the shopping channel.    

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,400
                    Now, there's
                only about 2,000

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,000
                 of these little
              babies left, so...

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
             a word to the wise.

154
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,600
                    Well?       

155
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,500
Well, that's, uh...             

156
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,900
It's beautiful, Woody.          

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,700
It's a beautiful cow.           

158
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,500
                    Yeah.       

159
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,100
        I'll say, and that's not
            the best part of it.

160
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
        It's also a great clock.

161
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,000
            (click)             

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
          MALE VOICE:           
            It's...             

163
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,900
    (imitating cow bellow):     
         <i>...noon.</i>               

164
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
                     What, um...

165
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,400
                 What happens if
              it's 7:00 o'clock?

166
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,400
                    Well,       

167
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,300
     a cow's power of speech are
      kind of limited, you know.

168
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,500
              Everything kind of
                  sounds like...

169
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
                (imitates cow   
                    bellowing): 
                     <i>...noon.</i>   

170
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
            How do you ever know
                what time it is?

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,700
            Well, it helps if   
            you wear a watch.   

172
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I think it's, um...             

173
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,600
I think it's nice, Woody.       

174
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,800
                         Really?

175
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.                           

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
                     It's yours.

177
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh, no, Woody.                  

178
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,900
I-I-I... I real...              
I couldn't.                     

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
                      Miss Howe,

180
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600
                    I've been to
                 your apartment.

181
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
                Take the cow.   

182
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,400
        I know you fellows favor
    a more formal atmosphere,   

183
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,200
                    but allow me
                    to charm you

184
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
                 with the quaint
                  hospitality of

185
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,700
my friendly                     
neighborhood tavern.            

186
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,700
      Excuse me, Frasier.       

187
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
    I have to go check          
          my messages.          

188
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,400
You got one                     
from Madame Tussauds.           

189
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
    "Get back                   
    to the museum."             

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,300
  Champagne for everyone, Sam.  

191
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,700
              Oh!               

192
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm trying to convince          
my esteemed colleagues          

193
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,900
to move their monthly meetings  
to your fine establishment.     

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
                Oh, hey, thanks.
                That's great.   

195
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,200
Uh, my, uh, gold card           

196
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,500
should keep the, uh...          
the bubbly flowing.             

197
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
(laughs)                        

198
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,000
                        NORM:   
             Cliffie, the master
                  has a thought.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
                          CLIFF:
                            Yes?

200
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,100
        One might wonder what   
            would happen if, uh,

201
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
             we called a certain
             credit card company

202
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
            and reported that   
            number as stolen.   

203
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,600
             Then when a certain
                 bartender tried

204
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
        to put it through for   
             a certain customer,

205
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,500
          and it wasn't honored,

206
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
             what do you suppose
                would happen?   

207
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I don't know.                   

208
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
                Major fireworks.

209
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,900
        Oh!                     

210
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,300
You're a genius!                

211
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,200
Why do you put up with me?      

212
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,200
                I don't know.   

213
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,900
Frasier, I have to leave.       

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,700
There's been an emergency.      

215
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,900
        Is it Frederick?        
                         No, no.

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
    Otto, my lab assistant,     

217
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,900
             has gotten into the
    synthetic hormones again.   

218
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,700
                    I have to   
                bail him out.   

219
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,300
            Or her. I won't know
              until I get there.

220
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,600
            Oh, no!             

221
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,300
        Miss Howe,              
look what I found in the trash! 

222
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,100
         It's your cow!         

223
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh, dear, how could that        
have gotten in there?           

224
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,000
                            Sam?

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
                  You told me to
            throw it away....   

226
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,400
                         So, the
                paranoid says...

227
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
        (laughing)              

228
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,900
          "Help! Help!          

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,100
  They're all out to get me!"   

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
                      (laughing)

231
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,700
     I guess you had to be      
        in the session.         

232
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,200
          Dr. Crane, can I speak
            to you for a minute?

233
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,000
             Oh, of course, Sam.
                            SAM:
                    Got a little

234
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,600
        problem here-- I, uh,   
          called to get approval

235
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,300
on your credit card here, and   
     they told me it was stolen.

236
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
Well that's utterly             
ludicrous, Sam.                 

237
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
              Well, yeah, that's
            what I told them,   

238
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,000
          but they-they insisted
              that it is stolen.

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
Yes, I-I knocked myself         
over the head                   

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,900
and stole my own credit card.   

241
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,800
That's brilliant, Sam.          
Who would ever suspect me?      

242
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
SAM:                            
I'm not kidding here.           

243
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,200
          You know, they're very
      serious about their rules.

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,700
             They told me that I
            have to cut this up.

245
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,400
You wouldn't, Sam!              

246
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,700
            I don't want to, no!

247
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,500
              Tell you what. Um,

248
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,200
                why don't I, uh,
                 run a tab, huh?

249
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,700
Well, I don't need a tab.       

250
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,100
It's a perfectly good card!     

251
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
                 Well, why don't
                  I just, uh...?

252
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
                  This is on the
            house, all right?   

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh, fine! Now you're adding     
insult to injury!               

254
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,900
Well, I don't take charity!     

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Just give me back               
my card!                        

256
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,000
        I can't give you back   
              the card, Frasier.

257
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,700
        I've got to cut it up   
             and send the pieces
            back to the company.

258
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
(scoffs)                        
You do not have to do that.     

259
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
                      Yes, I do!

260
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
                    They spent a
                    half an hour

261
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,700
        on just that fact at the
        seminar at the Sheraton.

262
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,000
Sam, I am telling you,          
you do not have to do that!     

263
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
                  You weren't at
                    the seminar.

264
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,900
             If I don't do this,
              they're gonna take

265
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,200
                  my little card
                    thingy away.

266
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,700
Sam, I am not asking you.       

267
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm telling you!                
Give me back my card!           

268
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,500
            Don't take that tone
            of voice with me!   

269
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,400
Frasier, can I help?            
I have a card that works.       

270
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,900
                 Oh shut up, you
              Skinnerian baboon!

271
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,700
Sam, do not touch               
those scissors to that card!    

272
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,900
        I got to do it, Frasier.

273
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,600
You do not!                     
                    Yes, I...   

274
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,400
(choking grunt)                 

275
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,200
                      I'm sorry.
                      I'm sorry.

276
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
              I t-tell you what.

277
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,200
                 Here, take-take
                my credit cards.

278
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
        Oh, fine!               

279
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,500
With your $90 credit limit,     

280
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
I can go hog-wild               
at Monkey Ward's!               

281
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,300
You have made me look the fool. 

282
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,100
            Yeah, I think you've
          taken care of that all
        by yourself, Frasier!   

283
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh. So it's come                
to this, has it?                

284
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
After years of friendship,      

285
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
you proudly pour a tall cup     
of humiliation.                 

286
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
Well, I've had enough,          
thank you.                      

287
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,600
This is good-bye.               

288
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,200
You have seen and heard         
the last of Frasier Crane.      

289
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,500
From this moment forward,       

290
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,000
    I am never stepping foot    
    in this bar again!          

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,900
I close the iron door upon you! 

292
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,400
What do we do now,              
oh master?                      

293
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,100
                Shut up and stop
              calling me master.

294
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,300
Anyone hear from Frasier        
since yesterday?                

295
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,900
                  He'll be back,
        don't worry about it.   

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,100
         I don't know,          
he left here pretty angry.      

297
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,500
            I mean,             
I keep calling the house,       

298
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,700
        and the machine         
    keeps picking up.           

299
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,900
      Oh, Lilith answers?       

300
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,200
         He's blowing off steam.

301
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,500
            He'll be back.      

302
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,900
    Oh, I hope so.              

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
Well... (clears throat)         

304
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,700
I guess we really               
messed up, huh?                 

305
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,100
                  We learned our
                  lesson, Cliff.

306
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
    We've got to stop messing   
            with people's minds.

307
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,800
    Yeah, I agree.              

308
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
                By the way, your
              fly's open, buddy.

309
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,200
Yeah, so's yours.               

310
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,100
        (both laughing)         

311
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,800
    You can't expect a guy to   
    go cold turkey, you know.   

312
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
        (laughing)              

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,700
                    You checked,
              didn't you, Cliff?

314
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Oh, yeah, like                  
you weren't looking             

315
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,700
through the bottom              
of that beer mug.               

316
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
        Miss Howe?              

317
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,300
Last night the shopping channel 

318
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,800
    was a consumer bonanza,     
  and I took advantage of it.   

319
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
    Their loss is your gain.    

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,900
First, I got you a genuine      
    gold-look bracelet          

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
    with 200 real sapphires.    

322
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
    Oh, Woody.                  

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
First of all, you have          
to stop buying me gifts.        

324
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,000
And second of all,              

325
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,700
you have to learn               
that sapphires are blue.        

326
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,600
         Okay, but you can't say
      "no" to a new and improved

327
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,400
      snackmaster <i>and</i> a portable
        solar-powered telephone.

328
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Woody, I cannot accept these.   

329
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
People are going to get         
the wrong idea.                 

330
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
            What, that I have   
                 a crush on you?

331
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,400
No, that I like crap.           

332
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,900
                  You're calling
              this stuff "crap"?

333
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm sorry, Woody.               

334
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,900
        No, no, I was looking   
             for the right word.

335
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, if you don't              
like it either,                 

336
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
why do you keep                 
buying this stuff?              

337
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,700
                    Not "stuff,"
             Miss Howe-- "crap."

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,800
        I buy it because        
      it looks good on TV.      

339
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,800
     The second they flash      
 that 800 number, I'm dialing.  

340
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Woody, this-this                
has got to stop.                

341
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,700
                 Well, it-it has
             stopped, Miss Howe.

342
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,000
        I went over my credit   
        limit with this... crap.

343
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,900
              Unless, of course,
        you'd care to advance me

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,300
      six months on my paycheck.

345
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,100
                Could be another
         necklace in it for you.

346
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,300
            An-And if you decide

347
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
     not to give me the advance,

348
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,900
          just keep the necklace
              as your free gift.

349
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Woody, you are hooked.          

350
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Listen to me,                   
you need help.                  

351
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,600
            I don't need help, I
          just need more credit.

352
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,200
        You're right, Miss Howe,
                 I do need help.

353
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,900
                    I'm scared. 

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,800
                    Help me.    

355
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,500
                Hurry.          

356
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,700
                Act now.        

357
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,100
             Well, I just got in
             touch with Frasier.

358
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,700
             NORM:              
    Oh, yeah, what'd he say?    

359
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,500
Well, he said that he considers 
these phone calls a harassment. 

360
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
If I don't cease and desist,    
he's gonna get a court order    

361
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,500
restraining me from coming      
within 50 feet of him.          

362
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,900
Restraining order--             

363
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,600
the last resort of shrinks      
and housewives in nightgowns.   

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
            Come on, Cliffie.   

365
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,800
        We've gotta stop this   
     before it gets any further.

366
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,600
  We've got to go to Frasier,   
tell him exactly what happened. 

367
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,700
    Accept all blame,           
and the sooner the better.      

368
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
Yeah, you're right.             

369
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,900
Wait a minute,                  
wait a minute.                  
                          What? 

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I just thought                  
of something.                   
                    What's that?

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
If we wait like a couple of     
hours, it'll be dinnertime.     

372
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,600
Might be able to snag           
a free meal.                    

373
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,200
             You are the master,
                       <i>oh salam.</i>

374
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,500
            Now, this is lovely.

375
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
      The baby's with my mother,

376
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,900
          and there's nothing to
      disturb our peaceful Eden.

377
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,000
You're right,                   
darling, nothing.               

378
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Except for the burned-in image 
             of Sam             

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,300
cutting my gold card into pieces
      before my very eyes.      

380
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,400
    You know, Frasier,          

381
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,300
after listening to you complain 
        about that              

382
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,700
    for the umpteenth time,     

383
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,900
it's becoming impossible for me 
         to sympathize.         

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
        (quietly):              
         Of course not.         

385
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,100
  Sympathy is a human emotion.  

386
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
             What?              

387
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,700
    Oh, I'm sorry, darling,     
     I'm just lashing out.      

388
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,100
        (quietly):              
  Got off a good one, though.   

389
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,400
  Frasier, you've got to stop   
this cycle of negativity.       

390
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,800
            Come, let's try some
            positive imagery.   

391
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,200
            You're back in Maui.

392
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,700
            Feel the trade winds
          caressing your cheeks,

393
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,000
             ruffling your hair.

394
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,600
      Smell the plumeria.       

395
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,200
    Taste the mai tai.          

396
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,900
      Feel the gentle swaying...

397
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,700
                  swaying of the
                  ancient palms.

398
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,600
                The rhythm...   
                the rhythm...   

399
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
                the rhythm...   

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,200
                  Are you there?

401
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,900
    Yes, I'm there.             

402
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,500
        I'm in paradise.        

403
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
         And I'm paying         
     for the whole shebang      

404
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,100
    with my gold card.          

405
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Which was gladly accepted,      
and returned in one piece,      

406
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,700
 by a man in a flowered sarong! 

407
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,500
Frasier, get a grip.            

408
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
    Oh, you're right,           
         you're right.          

409
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,800
        You know,               
Sam's done me a favor actually. 

410
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,400
Instead of spending the night   
     there in his sleazy saloon,

411
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,900
              I'm... I'm at home
              here with my love.

412
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,100
      I'm going to serenade you.

413
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,500
Why, Frasier, you haven't       
done that since...              

414
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
     Have you ever done that?   

415
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
    Well, I'm doing it now.     

416
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,300
  Remember this one, darling?   

417
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,100
     (plays gentle melody)      

418
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,800
How could I forget?             

419
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
     Autumn in New York...     
 Moonlight in Vermont...       

420
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,200
You sing it.                    

421
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,600
        All right.              

422
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,100
      Autumn in New York       

423
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,500
       What makes it seem      
         so exciting?          

424
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
      Autumn in New York       

425
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,600
      It spells the thrill     
     of first nighting...      

426
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
         (music stops)          

427
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,700
It was a lovely                 
honeymoon, wasn't it?           

428
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,600
        (voice breaks):         
      I bought this piano       
    with my gold card.          

429
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
        I mean, yes, dear.      

430
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
        (doorbell rings)        

431
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
I'll get it.                    

432
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
          Hi, Lilith.           

433
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
                    Cliff, Norm.

434
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
 Frasier, it's Cliff and Norm.  

435
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,900
            Well, good night,   
                      gentlemen.

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,800
         I've suddenly developed
        a splitting migraine.   

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,200
          Norm. Cliff.          

438
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,400
          What a pleasure to see
              my boon companions

439
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
                here in my home.
            Come in. Come in.   

440
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
    Yeah, well, Fras, look,     
we don't want to interrupt      

441
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,800
                  your dinner or
             anything like that.

442
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,000
 Oh, no, we finished hours ago. 

443
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,300
  Yeah, nice shortcut, Cliff.   

444
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,500
                  I see that you
                left the butcher

445
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
        of all things plastic   
                 back in the bar

446
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,700
                to come visit   
                    old Frasier.

447
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,000
          Yeah, yeah.           

448
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,300
          Fras, uh...           

449
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,800
     just out of curiosity, what
        did you have for dinner?

450
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,200
        Uh, uh, let me guess.   

451
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,100
    Wait. (inhales sharply)     

452
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,400
         Ah, porterhouse steaks,

453
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,300
smothered with mushrooms,       
green beans with sliced almonds,

454
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,300
  some, uh, apple brown Betty,  
          and, uh....           

455
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
    decaf cappuccino.           

456
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,100
                      (laughs)  
Ain't he something?             

457
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,200
                Actually, we had
             Chinese brought in.

458
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,100
  Guess it must be in my coat.  

459
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,100
Here, come... come and sit down.

460
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
You know, I can't tell you      
      how special this is.      

461
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,100
We never seem to get together   
outside of that infernal bar.   

462
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,700
              Never get together
                just as pals.   

463
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
          Yeah, whatever.       

464
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Fras, you don't have any Chinese
         left, do you?          

465
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
                      No, sorry.
Norm, Norm...                   

466
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
we come here                    
to talk about a topic           

467
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,200
a lot more important than food. 

468
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,900
    Found an almond cookie.     

469
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,900
     If you're here to try      
  to patch up my relationship   

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,100
with Mr. Malone, just forget it.

471
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,000
 Give me half, will you, Cliff? 

472
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,900
                     I tell you,
                     I have seen

473
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
    the last of that ex-jock    
        in a pompadour.         

474
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,500
 Frasier, you've got to let us  
  explain what happened here.   

475
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,200
    Fras, uh, you see,          
    sometimes guys...           

476
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,000
do things, you know,            
which they...                   

477
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,600
they think seem like...         

478
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,800
a good idea at the time.        

479
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,500
But they're really              
not such a good idea.           

480
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,100
I guess what                    
I'm trying to say is...         

481
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
That... that Sam wants me       
     to come back to Cheers     

482
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,800
 so that he can get down on his 
knees and apologize to me       

483
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,300
    in public and in person.    

484
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,500
Yeah, that's even better.       

485
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,600
Great, come on,                 
let's go.                       

486
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
             Sammy,             

487
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
 don't drop down on your knees  
     to beg for forgiveness     

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,200
        till he's all the way   
             through the door...

489
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,500
            but look who's here.

490
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,200
 Hey! You brought Frasier back. 

491
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
    See, now, if we can just    
    get them to erase           

492
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
 everything from their memories 
    from the last 36 hours,     

493
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,400
        we're home free.        

494
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm waiting, Sam.               

495
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,300
            Waiting for what?   

496
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
            Sammy, don't torture
                    your friend.

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,700
      Frasier just swallowed his
     pride to come back in here,

498
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
    so get down on your knees   
      and beg him to forgive you

499
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,700
                 and then we can
              start celebrating.

500
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
                      I'm sorry.

501
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Thanks, Sam.                    

502
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
                        NORM:   
                  That's what we
                    like to see.

503
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,200
Yeah, I bet you                 
nobody even remembers           

504
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,100
what started the silly argument 
in the first place.             

505
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,000
             I do--             
Sam cut up his gold card.       

506
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,100
        That was funny.         

507
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,800
                 Woody, come on,
                    we're, uh...

508
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
                     you know, I
            apologized for that.

509
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,600
                    We're beyond
                 that right now.

510
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,300
    Is that it?                 

511
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,800
That is the sum total           
of your contrition?             

512
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,700
I mean, I know you're not       
Walt Whitman, Sam,              

513
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,500
but I mean, really a couple more
"uhs" and "you knows"           

514
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
would at least lend it          
a little creditability.         

515
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
            Well, you didn't let
             me finish, Frasier.

516
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,400
              I was going to say
                  that I'm sorry

517
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,700
            that you were such a
              big jerk yesterday

518
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,200
            and that you're such
            a big baby today.   

519
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,500
Well, that tears it.            

520
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
When I walk out this time,      
believe me when I tell you      

521
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,300
that I will <i>never</i> brighten      
this door again.                

522
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,100
            Wait, wait, wait,   
                     wait, wait.

523
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,600
            Frasier, Frasier,   
                  wait a minute.

524
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,300
    Before this thing           
    gets any further,           

525
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
come on now, sit down, relax.   

526
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,300
    I think it's time           
    that both you guys          

527
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,500
     understand the truth.      

528
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,200
                  Cliffie?      

529
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,100
Well, Fras,                     
see, yesterday, uh,             

530
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,500
Normie and I, we were           
feeling a little frisky         

531
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,300
and as sort of a gag,           
we, uh, made a phone call       

532
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,600
and reported                    
your credit card stolen.        

533
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,800
                  My God, Cliff,
                  that is fraud!

534
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,600
                 You think you  
                know a guy, Sam.

535
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,400
         Damn it, Norm.         
            Come on.            

536
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,200
     All right, all right,      
        all right.              

537
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,400
                 I may have, uh,

538
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,300
            been in the vicinity
         during that phone call.

539
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
        I might have actually   
              dialed the number.

540
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,200
      So it's your fault?       

541
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,500
Sam, I owe you an apology.      

542
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,100
                         No, no.
    I had no idea.              

543
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
                          Boy.  

544
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,700
      You guys are really       
  stirring it up, aren't you?   

545
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
                Okay, fellas,   

546
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,200
             give me your credit
                cards right now.

547
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,300
                     What?      
     Aw...                      

548
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
      Give me your credit cards.

549
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,700
      You-you can't cut them up.

550
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,500
      I'm not gonna cut them up.

551
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,200
NORM:                           
Don't cut them up, Sam.         

552
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,800
Woody, you're back in business. 

553
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,200
    Shop away.                  

554
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
NORM:                           
Oh, no.                         
             All right.         

555
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,700
Get the scissors                
and cut them right now.         

556
