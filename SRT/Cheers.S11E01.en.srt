1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,069
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:06,304
Boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy. Yep.

3
00:00:06,305 --> 00:00:08,239
Woody's wedding was quite
an event, wasn't it, Norm?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,740
Oh, man.
Huh, huh?

5
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,842
Boy, what a night
that was. Yeah.

6
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:13,060
Yeah, the priest dying.
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,963
Carla being caught
in a dumb-waiter.

8
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:16,298
Ha!

9
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,032
How about that German guy
trying to kill Sam?

10
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:19,000
(chuckling)

11
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,134
"Du, dort!"

12
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:22,103
Remember that?

13
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,738
Yeah, oh, golly.

14
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,407
Oh, yeah, but all that
was nothing

15
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:26,824
compared to the
wedding itself. Yeah.

16
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,143
Oh, now, there
was a comedy of errors.

17
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:30,578
(chuckling)

18
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,447
Hey, it's not
quite 2:00.

19
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,749
What do you say we, uh,
stop off at Cheers, huh?

20
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,518
Won't, uh...
won't Vera be angry?

21
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:37,602
She'll never know.

22
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,820
Yeah, well, I guess not.

23
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,322
She... she sure
put away

24
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:41,389
that champagne at the wedding.

25
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,758
Yeah, she's a big girl.

26
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,795
Yeah, she's still
out cold, too.

27
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,396
(sighs)

28
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:51,533
Okay, just don't slam the
door when you get out.

29
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,435
And remember...
crack a window.

30
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,203
You're a good husband,
Norm Peterson.

31
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:58,540

CARLA:
Okay, Sammy, I'm going home.

39
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:44,536
I put away all the glasses.

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,721
The, uh, bottles
are in the storeroom,

41
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:48,189
and all the rest of the garbage

42
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,424
from the wedding's
in the office.

43
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,658
Thank you, honey, I'll lock up.

44
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:51,793
Where's Rebecca?

45
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:54,129
Just told you,
she's in the office.

46
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,548
Hey, Norm, uh, you mind

47
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,650
if we make a stop or two
on the way home?

48
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:01,285
I, uh, forgot
to finish my route.

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,187
Cliff, no.

50
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,390
Eh, all right.
I'll do it tomorrow.

51
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,411
Hey, Rebecca.

52
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,195
Hi, Sam.

53
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,664
You okay?

54
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,366
Yeah, I'm just thinking,
you know.

55
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,434
Weddings always
make me do that.

56
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,437
I have nothing
to show for my life. Oh, come on.

57
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,122
You're being a little harsh
on yourself, aren't you?

58
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,173
I mean, come on,

59
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:23,357
take a look at today, right?

60
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,108
The wedding started
to fall apart.

61
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,328
You pulled the whole
thing together.

62
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,796
Yeah, I sort of did, didn't I?

63
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:30,064
You bet you did.

64
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,782
You know, you know,
I used to think

65
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,785
that if I married a millionaire
or if I had a baby,

66
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,389
I'd be a better person,
but now I realize

67
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,923
that the only thing

68
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:40,959
that's gonna make me
a better person is me.

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,128
Boy, as scary
as that sounds, it's true.

70
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,981
In fact, you see this cigarette?

71
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:48,400
This is the last cigarette
I'm gonna smoke forever.

72
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,701
(chuckles)
This is gonna be my...

73
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,102
my symbol of change,

74
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,570
you know, the old Rebecca
burning away.

75
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,938
And I'll tell you
something else.

76
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,006
Starting tomorrow,

77
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,474
there's gonna
be no more whining

78
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:57,675
and no more complaining.

79
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,411
I am gonna be the best manager

80
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,778
in the whole world.

81
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,913
(chuckling)

82
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,415
Okay, good night.

83
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:08,186
I gotta get my life together.

84
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,670
No more screw ups.

85
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,572
No more mistakes.

86
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,511
Good-bye, old Rebecca.

87
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,982
(door opening, closing)

88
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,617
(crackling)

89
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:28,490
(indistinct radio chatter)

90
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:37,732
Well, I think we've got this one
pretty much under control.

91
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,034
You get hold of the owner?

92
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,868
Yes, sir, should be
here any minute.

93
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,588
Engines 28 and 30
can head back.

94
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,641
Oh...

95
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,860
oh, my God.

96
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,078
Mr. Malone.

97
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,580
Everything's under control.

98
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,449
The fire's out,
no one was hurt.

99
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,752
It was basically confined
to this end of the bar.

100
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,921
Oh...

101
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:02,006
oh, this is terrible.

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,261
How did...

103
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:08,263
This is my bar.

104
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,134
Oh, man.

105
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:17,539
Oh, oh, yes, wait a minute.

106
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,240
(laughing loudly)

107
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,475
Oh, thank God!

108
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,509
Whoo!

109
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,810
(laughing)

110
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,045
This is great.

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,880
This is really good.

112
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,115
I'm sorry?

113
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,300
Gary, you know, from
Gary's Olde Towne Tavern?

114
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:30,301
Oh, we're doing...

115
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:31,886
always doing pranks
like this, you know.

116
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,022
First, he makes the bar
look like it burned down,

117
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,207
and then he gets you guys
to go along with it.

118
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,875
You are very good.

119
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,444
Whoo!

120
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,747
Come on, lighten up, will you?

121
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,516
Come on, Gary!

122
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,733
Come on out.

123
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,501
Hey, you know,
time to push the button,

124
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,603
make everything
go back together again, Gary.

125
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:51,172
Gary!

126
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,613
It's not Gary, is it?

127
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,124
Sammy, this is terrible.

128
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:12,093
You know, it just hurts me

129
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,428
just to look at this place.

130
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:14,779
I know, I know.

131
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,414
But I'll tell you something.

132
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,132
As soon as the
insurance kicks in,

133
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,284
we're gonna get this place

134
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,095
back on its feet
in a couple of weeks.

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,954
I just wish I knew
how it started.

136
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,591
Hold it right there.

137
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,292
What are you saying, Sammy?

138
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,462
That a Tortelli kid
would torch his mother's

139
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,598
place of business
just for spite?

140
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,483
No, I'd never think that.

141
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,685
Why not? It's
plausible.

142
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:40,721
Listen, just...
just start cleaning up.

143
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,540
You know, we're gonna...
all gonna feel better

144
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,641
if we just start cleaning up.

145
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,975
You know, I gotta say, Sammy,

146
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,878
you're taking this whole thing
pretty darn well.

147
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,345
Not like some people.

148
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,980
NORM:
Oh, the humanity.

149
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,950
(Norm crying)

150
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,653
Norm, I wish you'd
stop saying that.

151
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,789
You've got to get a
hold of yourself.

152
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,658
I'm sorry, I...
I just...

153
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:04,929
This place means
so damn much to me.

154
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,781
It's my home.

155
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:10,334
Hell, for the last few years,
it's been my life.

156
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,003
And the thought of living
without it, Sammy...

157
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,489
(Norm weeping)

158
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:16,290
Oh, buddy.

159
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,424
Now, I'm gonna be
over at Gary's

160
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:18,875
for the next few days, okay?

161
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,929
I want you to give me a call

162
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,698
when it looks
decent, all right?

163
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,419
Somebody said
there'd been a fire.

164
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:29,737
Oh, my God,

165
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,972
I had no idea it was this bad.

166
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,474
Sam, what happened?

167
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,909
We don't know yet, sweetheart.

168
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,711
But don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

169
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,263
I've already called
the contractor,

170
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,914
phone company,

171
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:40,781
the electric guy.

172
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,049
I think that's everybody.

173
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,734
Sam...?

174
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,454
Well, almost everybody.

175
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,475
Well, Sam, I see you monkeys
have discovered fire.

176
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:56,730
Would you like to come upstairs

177
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:58,481
and see the damage
at Melville's?

178
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,919
You know, why not?

179
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,387
It might even cheer me up.

180
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,858
Hi, everybody.

181
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,060
What happened here?

182
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,395
Woody, we had a fire.

183
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,965
Oh, no.

184
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,567
This is terrible.

185
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:20,038
This is Cheers, my home
for the past seven years,

186
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,241
the place where I grew
up, and now look at it.

187
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,743
You ought to see the pool table.

188
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:26,444
It actually fused to the floor.

189
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,313
Really? Cool.

190
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,469
Oh, my God.

191
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:38,506
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

192
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,676
Oh, my God.

193
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,882
Cliff, was that
undelivered mail?

194
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,717
Oh, yeah, it was, Doc.

195
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,135
Oh...

196
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,271
my sweet Lord,
what a catastrophe.

197
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,940
I mean, there could be letters
from mothers to sons in there.

198
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,510
Social Security checks,
wedding invitations.

199
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,781
Well, there's only one thing
left for me to do now.

200
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,865
What's that, Cliff?

201
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:05,964
Get up early tomorrow

202
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,985
and stage a Jeep accident.

203
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:13,574
Well, it's a good thing
this fire didn't spread.

204
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,042
It could have been
like that fire

205
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:17,011
my great-grandmother's
cow started.

206
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,298
Darned thing kicked
over a lantern,

207
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,109
burned an entire city
to the ground.

208
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,602
Yep.

209
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,371
The shame was so great,
the family had to move to Ohio

210
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,741
and change their last name
to Wilkins.

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,727
But, Woody, you're
from Indiana,

212
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,895
and your family name is Boyd.

213
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,832
Oh, well, some stuff
happened in Ohio.

214
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,770
Come on, Woody, we've got
to get to the airport.

215
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,141
You know,
when these things happen,

216
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,377
it really makes you
stop and think.

217
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,498
Bye, everybody.

218
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,134
Next time you see us,
we'll be tan.

219
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,469
Bye, Woody.

220
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:03,407
Well, I discovered
the cause of the fire.

221
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,075
Same old story.

222
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,363
Some idiot tosses a cigarette
into a trash can,

223
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,797
and the whole thing goes up.

224
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,598
Are you sure?

225
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,051
Yeah, seen it 100 times.

226
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,086
When are people gonna learn?

227
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,373
(hyperventilating)

228
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,641
Are you all right?

229
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:21,842
Uh-huh, I'm fine.

230
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:24,879
Oh, my God.

231
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,664
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

232
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:27,832
Oh, my God.

233
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,566
Oh, my God.

234
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,401
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

235
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:32,637
You know, I couldn't help

236
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,328
overhearing that conversation.

237
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,425
Wild guess:
Your cigarette?

238
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,396
No.

239
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,649
Rebecca, you burned down
the bar, didn't you?

240
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,833
What, am I wearing a sign?

241
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,385
Are you gonna tell Sam?

242
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,586
Could you?

243
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,589
I don't really think
it's my place.

244
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,641
No, I mean, could you tell him
you did it?

245
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,596
Rebecca, you have a very
difficult choice to make.

246
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:01,099
My advice to you is to
simply tell Sam the truth.

247
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,434
He's gonna find out
about it in any event.

248
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,935
You're right.

249
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,671
He will.

250
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,406
All right, I'll tell him.

251
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,574
And I mean,
he's a friend of mine,

252
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:11,742
and it was an accident.

253
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,270
He'll understand, won't he?

254
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,095
Okay.

255
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,330
Thank you, I feel better.

256
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,498
(footsteps)

257
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,817
REBECCA:
Sam?

258
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,668
Could I talk to you a second?

259
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,404
Yeah.

260
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,175
Sam, we found out how
the fire got started.

261
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:29,760
You're kidding.
No, and-and...

262
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,946
the guy said, you know,
he's seen it happen

263
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,048
100 times, so he's
seen it a lot.

264
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,451
How did it happen?
What...

265
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:38,336
I-I'm getting to that, it's
just sort of hard to say.

266
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,287
Please tell me.

267
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,798
All right, all
right, I-I'll...

268
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,574
The fire was started by...

269
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,412
Faulty wiring.

270
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,017
Faulty wiring?

271
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,452
Faulty wiring.

272
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,738
Been meaning to take care
of that for years.

273
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,256
My God.

274
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,043
I burned down my own bar.

275
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:04,945
Oh, Sam.
Oh!

276
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:05,897
It's gonna be okay.

277
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,231
We all make stupid mistakes.

278
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,000
No.

279
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,201
(both crying)

280
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,778
CARLA:
Okay, guys, I got

281
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,712
the plastic bags.

282
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,213
You can start bagging the soot.

283
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,017
What happened to you?

284
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,302
Uh, a little Jeep accident.

285
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,210
Nice of you to, uh...
join us, Norm. Well...

286
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,746
Thought you were gonna
wait it out at Gary's. Well, I was,

287
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:40,931
but then it... I
came to my senses

288
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,566
and realized my place was here

289
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,001
helping Sammy.

290
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,787
If we all pitch in,
we'll have this place

291
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,187
back together in no time.

292
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:48,840
Gary wouldn't run you
a tab, huh?

293
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,142
No, he was a real
jerk about it, too.

294
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,010
(door squeaks open)

295
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,112
FRASIER:
Rebecca? What?

296
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,397
Have you told Sam
how the fire started?

297
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,567
Oh, yeah, I told him, and, uh,
he kissed me, and he hugged me,

298
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,537
and he-he told me what
a big person I was to tell him.

299
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:04,939
You didn't tell him, did you?

300
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,724
Of course not, you moron!

301
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:08,159
Rebecca, don't

302
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,493
you realize
that unless you tell him,

303
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:10,862
your guilt will get
progressively worse?

304
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,346
You'll start to shake.

305
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,081
You'll get the cold sweats,

306
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,165
insomnia, nervousness.

307
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,800
Suddenly one morning,
you'll wake up,

308
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:19,003
and you'll be paralysed
from fear and guilt.

309
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,188
I can live with that.

310
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,554
It'll just be like
every other Monday.

311
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:29,647
Well, I called
the insurance company.

312
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,849
We're not getting a penny.

313
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,683
What?!

314
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,318
Well, it turns out

315
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,554
that my insurance policy, uh,
had a $25,000 deductible.

316
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,707
Isn't that rather high, Sam?

317
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:40,908
Yes, it is,

318
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,176
Mr. Where The
Hell Were You

319
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,347
When the Agent Was
Talking a Mile a Minute?

320
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,664
God, man, I'm, um,

321
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,467
in a lot more trouble
than I thought I was.

322
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:53,737
Rest easy, my friend.

323
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:56,524
I'm gonna take out my cheque book,

324
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,209
and I'm going to write,

325
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,061
"Pay to the order

326
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,098
of Sam Malone."

327
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,033
Then I'm going
to fill in an amount

328
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,885
that will be more than adequate

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,054
to bring Cheers back
to its former glory.

330
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:14,025
There. I've signed it.

331
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,828
Now all we need is the signature
of Lilith Sternin-Crane.

332
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,967
Oh, she'll put up a fight,
the little badger,

333
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,203
but this is important to you,
so it's important to me.

334
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,856
I'm simply gonna go home
and demand that she sign it.

335
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,157
Yes, demand!

336
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,725
I don't care what she says.

337
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,260
She will sign it!

338
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,148
Thanks, Fras.

339
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,682
Uh, you know, I'll
probably just go

340
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,251
to a bank or
something, you know?

341
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,870
Oh, thank you, Sam, thank you.

342
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,808
There was... no way.

343
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,776
You understand.

344
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,052
Your monthly cash flow is,

345
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:00,321
uh, this figure here?

346
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:01,605
And now you want us

347
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,507
to grant you a loan?

348
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,009
Yes, please, and by
the end of the day, too.

349
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:07,411
Thank you.
Uh-huh.

350
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:11,381
Am I on one of those programs
with the hidden camera?

351
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,235
Oh, no, I-I'm
afraid you're not.

352
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,385
I know I'm not.

353
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,554
I was making a point.

354
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,907
Mr. Malone,

355
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,709
there is no way
we can grant you a loan.

356
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,994
I've been to
every bank in town.

357
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,129
They've all said no.

358
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,363
Listen, oh, come on, you know,

359
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,965
you're supposed to

Sam...

375
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,876
I burned down the bar.

376
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:59,613
And, you know, see,
speaking of bars burning down,

377
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:00,748
guess what I did?

378
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,887
Hi, Sam.
Did you get the loan?

379
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,271
No.

380
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,589
Oh.

381
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,159
It's all right,
though, you know.

382
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,994
It's not the end of the world.

383
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,018
Yeah, I've been
thinking long and hard.

384
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,364
I got a plan here.

385
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:20,284
You know, I figured
that if I, uh... if I cash in

386
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,171
my baseball pension, you know,
max out my credit cards

387
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,440
and maybe move
to a cheaper apartment,

388
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:28,275
and...

389
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,545
well... sell the Vette.

390
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,664
A neighbour of mine, Kirby, uh,

391
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,450
had his eye on it
for a long time,

392
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:39,286
and, uh, he's upstairs right now
taking a look at it.

393
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:40,620
No, no.
Sammy, your Vette?

394
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:43,290
Well, I... You know,
it'll be all right, um...

395
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,424
she'll come back to me.

396
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,926
She'll-She'll find me.

397
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,678
Like...

398
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,980
Lassie?

399
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:57,438
All right, Sam,
you got yourself a deal.

400
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,505
All right, okay.

401
00:15:58,506 --> 00:15:59,840
There's the check.
Yeah, thanks.

402
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:01,174
Thanks, Kirby.
That's great.

403
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,310
The, uh... the
title and the, uh,

404
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,763
registration are in
the glove compartment. Yeah.

405
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,981
Okay. Great.

406
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:09,583
Well, uh, so I guess
all I need now are the keys.

407
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:17,108
Sam, the, uh, keys?

408
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:23,831
Thanks.

409
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,787
Thanks.

410
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,239
No, no! Wait! Wait...!

411
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,540
(groans)

412
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,808
Please.

413
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:35,842
Listen, there-there's
another way.

414
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:37,411
I just thought of another way.

415
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:38,979
See, I can get this money.

416
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,348
All I have to do is,
uh, come up

417
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,617
with a simple product
that America needs.

418
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:45,970
What?

419
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,888
No. Listen to me. You know,
like-like the Pet Rock.

420
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,490
Or the, uh... You know,
the vacuum thing

421
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,225
that-that cuts your hair
at the same time.

422
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:54,028
Or-Or maybe even,
you know, the-the toilet duck.

423
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:56,397
You-You know, just throw
it together from scraps

424
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,599
around here, you know,
and-and sell millions of 'em.

425
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,502
You know, why didn't I, uh,
think of that before?

426
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,904
Sam, you're just making
this harder on yourself.

427
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:06,807
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

428
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:10,377
Yeah.

429
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,812
You know, they, uh,

430
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:14,314
stole that toilet duck
idea from me.

431
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:15,682
Hmm?

432
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,584
Yeah. Yeah,
you see, uh,

433
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,854
in my original sketches,
I had it as a goat.

434
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,890
KIRBY:
Look, uh, Sam,

435
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,624
if you don't mind, uh,

436
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:26,693
I'm ready
to drive my Corvette home now.

437
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,133
(clears throat)

438
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,968
Sorry, Sammy.
Oh.

439
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:38,905
Thanks.

440
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,710
(mumbles)

441
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:48,031
Kirby, take care of her.

442
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,118
(door closes)

443
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,504
This is a day
I never thought I'd see.

444
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,406
SAM:
Yeah, me, too.

445
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,224
You know what makes it worse?

446
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:58,642
This is all my fault.

447
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:01,312
You know, I'm the one
who did this to myself.

448
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,264
If I'd checked the wiring,
you know?

449
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,465
That's a stupid mistake

450
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,533
I'm gonna live with
the rest of my life.

451
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:13,057
(crying)

452
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,375
Oh, come on,
what is it now, Rebecca?

453
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,294
(crying)

454
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:22,032
I have something
I have to tell you.

455
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,753
(crying)

456
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:29,439
(Rebecca sniffles)

457
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:43,170
Sam, the fire
wasn't your fault.

458
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,908
I was smoking a cigarette,
and I burned down your bar.

459
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,245
You did this?

460
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:56,016
You did this to me?

461
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,652
Yes, yes, of course.

462
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,122
Why didn't I figure
this out earlier?

463
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:05,358
My bar burns down,
you're within 50 miles...

464
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,010
it all fits.

465
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,948
Sam, I'm so sorry.

466
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,117
Yeah, what-what...
what were you thinking?

467
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,801
Huh?

468
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,270
You tired of screwing
up your own life?

469
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,456
You start to pick on mine?

470
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,608
You know, of all the stupid,

471
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,810
stupid things you've done

472
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,812
in your useless life,

473
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,781
this is your masterpiece!

474
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,951
I'll tell you
what. Why...?

475
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:34,954
Get out.

476
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:37,724
Get out of my bar.

477
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,712
(sighs)

478
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,167
(door opening)

479
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:48,785
(horn honking, engine revving)

480
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,454
Sam, it was an accident.

481
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,890
She had it coming.

482
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,725
Nobody had that coming.

483
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,561
I don't want anyone
to defend her.

484
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,179
She's gone. Case closed.

485
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,782
Let's just get back
to work here.

486
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,184
I'll give you a hand.

487
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:07,371
Well, I guess we've seen
the dark side of Sam Malone.

488
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,074
Hmm. You want
to see dark sides,

489
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,143
you ought to see Ma

490
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,944
when you leave
the shower curtain

491
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,513
on the outside of the tub.

492
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,803
Wow.

493
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,173
That's something
you don't do twice.

494
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,156
I know you don't want me here,
and I'm going.

495
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,991
I just wanted to drop this off.

496
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,127
I cashed in my checking account
and savings,

497
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,130
and, uh, everything
I could scrape together.

498
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:51,614
I owe you this.

499
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,467
Good-bye, Sam.

500
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:54,467
Rebecca, wait-wait a minute.

501
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:56,136
No.

502
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,723
Sam, look, you and I don't have
anything to say to each other.

503
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:02,476
You said some things today
that you cannot take back,

504
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,728
and you really hurt me.

505
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,314
And I know
that what I did was terrible,

506
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:10,017
but what you did was worse
because you did it on purpose.

507
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,786
I don't want to ever
see you or this bar again.

508
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,072
Good-bye.

509
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,874
Do you want your job back?

510
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,592
(crying):
Yeah, I really do!

511
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,504
I'm sorry.

512
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,806
Listen, uh,

513
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,758
why-why don't I, uh,

514
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,993
get my jacket
and drive you home?

515
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,229
Or maybe, uh...

516
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,681
maybe we'll take a walk.

517
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,649
It's such a nice, nice evening.

518
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:45,936
Sam, uh, just out of curiosity,

519
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,172
why are you taking me back?

520
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,727
Well, I...
I remember that five years ago,

521
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:57,197
after I had sold this place,
I came back to the bar,

522
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,533
and, you know,
my boat had sunk,

523
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,501
I didn't have a dime,
I didn't have a job,

524
00:22:01,502 --> 00:22:04,272
and I needed someone to give me
a break, and you did that.

525
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,042
And I owe you one.

526
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,294
Sam...

527
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,798
Hey, listen, uh, this
is very important.

528
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,600
We're even now.

529
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,668
Oh...

530
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,436
Yeah. All right.

531
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:21,721
You want to go out and
get a pizza or something?

532
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:23,357
Sure.
All right.

533
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:24,624
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,560
Um, I don't have any money.

535
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:28,344
Oh, that's okay.
We'll-We'll just

536
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,363
