00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,557
these are not                   
your assembly line clodhoppers. 

127
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,859
      These are precisely       
    machine-measured.           

128
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,111
            How do I do it then?

129
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,546
    Just trace your tootsies    
      on a cocktail napkin      

130
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,813
 over here, fellas, all right?  

131
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,400
I'll tell you.                  

132
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:20,435
This brings back memories       

133
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,969
  of my dad when I was a kid.   

134
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:22,503
            Did you all always  
            used to order       

135
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,687
            your shoes          
            through the mail?   

136
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,472
  He was always getting taken   

137
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:26,674
    by some huckster.           

138
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:30,011
Sam,                            

139
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,079
      if you were throwing      
            a party,            

140
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,847
  would you order Dom Perignon  
          or Cristal?           

141
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:33,581
            Cristal.            

142
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,516
Dom Perignon it is, then.       

143
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,405
This is getting insulting.      

144
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,924
        You know, I don't think 
        that she respects us.   

145
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,392
    What do you mean "us," Sam? 

146
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:47,061
    You're the one who goofed   
    up that champagne thing.    

147
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:49,063
            Woody, come on, man.

148
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:50,398
                We're a team.   

149
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:53,267
Is that the insulting part?     

150
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:54,802
        This... the point is,   

151
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:55,870
            she doesn't think   
            that we're worthy   

152
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:59,273
    of hanging around           
    with her society friends.   

153
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,559
            She thinks          
            we're nincompoops.  

154
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,661
Nincompoops?                    

155
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:04,662
Let's go, Sam.                  

156
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,013
                We're going     
                to talk to her. 

157
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:06,881
What?                           

158
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:10,034
        Nobody calls Woody Boyd 
        a nincompoop.           

159
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,470
         Except my dad.         

160
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,155
( <i>knocking</i> )                    

161
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,708
Miss Howe,                      

162
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,410
     with all due respect,      

163
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:22,413
     that nincompoop crack      
          really hurt.          

164
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:26,133
    Woody, I didn't call you    
         a nincompoop.          

165
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,353
        All right, then why     
        you won't let us tend   
        bar at your party?      

166
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:30,288
        Is it because you think 
        we're incompetent?      

167
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,040
            You think we're     
            not smooth enough?  

168
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,792
        You think we're uncouth?

169
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,611
      No, I need you here.      

170
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,212
                    Oh, okay.   

171
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,748
                Let's go, Sam.  

172
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:41,749
            Whoa, whoa, whoa.   

173
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,917
            What are you doing? 
            Where are you going?

174
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:44,619
        Sam, now, look.         

175
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:45,736
    Really, why do you care?    

176
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:47,622
    Why on Earth do you want    
      to work this party?       

177
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,440
            All right, you know,
            by not hiring us,   

178
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,176
        what you're doing is    
        you're telling the rest 
        of the world            

179
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,712
that Sam Malone is not fit      
for the society of decent folks,

180
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:57,115
     that he's incompetent,     
    that he's a clod.           

181
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,149
What about me, Sam?             

182
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,617
                You, too, Woody.

183
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,034
I'm going to tell you           

184
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:01,852
                something, lady.

185
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,237
            We may not have come
            out of Harvard.     

186
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:04,639
            We may not belong   
            to a yacht club.    

187
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:07,341
    We may not have tended      
    bar at a polo tournament,   

188
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,977
                but we know how 
                to do our job   

189
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,981
            and we do it with   
            dignity and class.  

190
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,950
         You're right.          

191
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:17,952
  I'm sorry. The job is yours.  

192
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:19,870
                    All right!  
                    Whoa, baby! 

193
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,089
             Whoo!              

194
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:24,459
Whoo! Whoo, baby!               

195
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,089
     Lovely party, Rebecca.     

196
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,707
  Why, thank you, Mr. Collier.  

197
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,530
                Isn't this place
                something, Sam? 

198
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:46,598
Ooh, yeah.                      

199
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,232
        I think it's even nicer 

200
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:51,169
        than Wheeler's Funeral  
        Parlor in Hanover.      

201
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,271
            Of course, that's   
            not the most fun    
            place in town.      

202
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,472
Well, I'll bet not.             

203
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,675
        That would be           
        Bob's Funeral Parlor.   

204
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:00,578
Oh, my God.                     

205
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,998
Woody, is it me                 
or is that woman gorgeous?      

206
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:05,566
            You look nice, Sam, 

207
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:09,003
                but I'm going   
                to have to go   
                with the woman. 

208
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:10,838
Do me a favor here,             
will ya, buddy?                 

209
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:12,806
        Hold down the fort here 

210
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,975
        while I pass that lady  
        a tray of smoked Sammy. 

211
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:21,115
Great party, huh?               

212
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,450
                        Yes.    

213
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:26,220
                    I'll have   
                    a Manhattan.

214
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,488
        What?                   

215
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:29,323
        Oh, this.               

216
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,692
Well, you think                 
I'm a bartender, huh?           

217
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:34,878
What do you think you are?      

218
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:35,997
Well, to tell you               
the truth,                      

219
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,048
I used to be a bartender,       

220
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,266
but now I'm an                  
eccentric millionaire.          

221
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:42,003
        I just dress like this  
        to remind myself        

222
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,205
        of my modest beginnings.

223
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,340
Back behind the bar.            

224
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,144
        I pay her to say that.  
        It keeps me humble.     

225
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,762
          Malone, now!          

226
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,532
                Ooh, that was   
                a good one, huh?

227
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,936
I'm going to have               
to give her a raise, huh?       

228
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,806
         Looking good.          

229
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,407
Woody, what are you doing?!     

230
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,026
        That is not a trash can.

231
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,593
        That is a work of art.  

232
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,568
                    Oh, my God. 

233
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,937
    This is just what I need    
    is for Collier to see this. 

234
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,237
            He is a collector.  

235
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:18,739
Oh, hey, let's                  
calm down now.                  

236
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,374
  Nobody's seen anything yet.   

237
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,110
 Woody, take it in the kitchen  
    and clean it out.           

238
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:24,245
Sure, Sam.                      
Sorry, Miss Howe.               

239
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,246
                    Woody, go.  
                    Just go.    

240
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,215
        I got you. I got you.   

241
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:28,382
                I tell you, Sam.

242
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,517
     This is the last time      

243
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,785
    I'm going to throw          
  one of these fancy parties.   

244
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,754
    The next time one           
    of these hotshots wants...  

245
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,655
    ( <i>glass breaking</i> )          

246
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,494
     Don't worry, Ms. Howe.     

247
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:41,995
 It was only a tray of glasses. 

248
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,833
        Thank God.              
  Let's not tempt fate, Woody.  

249
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,152
     I'll clean it myself.      

250
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,739
They weren't great glasses,     
Sam, and they were dirty.

00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:55,025
    ( <i>glass breaking</i> )          

252
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:02,483
            Just a guess here:  
            uh, the vase?       

253
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,908
         It was there.          
    I was holding it.           

254
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:14,211
It was right in my hands,       
    and now it's gone.          

255
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,780
Maybe we can glue it            
back together                   

256
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,081
and no one will ever know.      

257
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,499
          Forget that.          

258
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,135
              Oh!               

259
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,437
            Just calm down now. 

260
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,038
Calm down.                      
It was an accident.             

261
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,673
I'm sure Mr. Collier            
will understand.                

262
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:26,774
                No, he won't.   

263
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:27,875
                This isn't the  
                first time      

264
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,310
                I've goofed up  
                at the company. 

265
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:30,945
         I started out          
     as a junior executive      

266
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:33,514
  and I'm diligently working    
  my way down to the mailroom   

267
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:38,552
     with a brief stopover      
 at that Siberia called Cheers. 

268
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:42,507
Shh-shh. Stop it.               
Just calm down here.            
Calm down.                      

269
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,142
        I know.                 
        I'll just resign now,   

270
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,744
        move back to San Diego, 

271
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,179
            join the Navy,      
            grow old and die.   

272
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:50,148
Oh...                           

273
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,853
                Boy, Sam,       
                I really feel   
                sorry for her.  

274
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,922
Never thought I'd say it,       
but so do I.                    

275
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,859
Look at this party              
she threw together here,        

276
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,962
and then that happens.          
Poor kid.                       

277
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,298
            You think they'll   
            make me manager?    

278
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,767
Hey, yo, over here.             

279
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,941
You know, Woody,                

280
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:20,578
I'm about to do                 
a decent thing here.            

281
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:21,562
                        Get out.

282
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,263
Yeah.                           

283
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,715
    I'm going to take           
    the fall for this.          

284
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,317
         What the hell?         
     I'm a great bartender.     

285
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,587
I can get a job anywhere I want.

286
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,239
            Sam, that's the     
            second nicest thing 
            you've ever done.   

287
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,307
Well, thank you.                

288
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,459
    What's the nicest?          

289
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,078
            When you let me     
            drive your Corvette.

290
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:38,946
      Right. Right, right.      

291
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,698
That's good. That's good.       

292
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:46,987
        Excuse me, young man.   

293
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,906
What happened to the vase       
    that was sitting there?     

294
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,040
    Somebody move it?           

295
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:56,430
Sir, I have a confession.       

296
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,598
     My name is Woody Boyd,     

297
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,633
        and by accident,        
    I broke your vase.          

298
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,586
             You...             

299
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,387
         you broke it?!         

300
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:04,304
                        You...  

301
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,208
Do you know how many years      
            I waited            

302
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,743
 to add that to my collection?  

303
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:13,480
         Do you realize         
the significance of that piece? 

304
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,132
            No, sir.            

305
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,601
 And I also broke some glasses. 

306
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,324
No, Sam,                        
I can't let you do it.          

307
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:24,675
It wouldn't be right if you...  

308
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:30,097
 Uh, Mr. Collier, there's been  
      a terrible accident.      

309
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,433
 Yes. This person just told me  

310
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:35,569
                how he destroyed
                my vase.        

311
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,171
    But Woody didn't do it.     

312
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,190
What she means                  
is I didn't do it               
on purpose.                     

313
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,707
                    Yes, I know.

314
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:43,327
 The only thing that can match  
    my great disappointment     

315
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,897
    at losing the vase          
    is the admiration           

316
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:49,083
    that I feel for this boy.   

317
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:55,272
            Woody, you showed   
            great courage       
            and integrity       

318
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,541
        in stepping up          
        to face the music here. 

319
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,043
        Rebecca, would you mind 
        standing in for Woody   

320
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,078
            for a little while? 

321
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:02,212
            You wouldn't mind,  
            would you?          

322
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:03,781
            I'd like to get     
            to know him better. 

323
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:10,387
            You want a drink?   

324
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,256
Well, sure.                     

325
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,958
                 Well, just tell
                 the girl.      

326
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:19,679
Miss Howe, I'll have a...       
         gin and tonic.         

327
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:20,998
         Well, come on.         
      She'll bring 'em in.      

328
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,866
                          WOODY:
                          Oh.   

329
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:37,364
    Another Manhattan.          

330
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,283
        Manhattan, huh?         

331
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,119
 I own a lot of that, you know? 

332
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,522
Right, the eccentric millionaire
            routine.            

333
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,239
You know, I got                 
to tell you the truth here.     

334
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,676
I'm getting kind of bored       
serving all these stiffs drinks.

335
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,043
What do you say                 
you and I go out                

336
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:51,311
and spend some                  
of my money?                    

337
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,114
What time does France           
close anyway?                   

338
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,017
                 I think they're
                 remodeling.    

339
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,385
    Oh.                         

340
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,954
                  Have any other
                  suggestions?  

341
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:02,706
Unfortunately, my mansion's     
being painted                   

342
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,325
and my yacht's                  
in dry dock.                    

343
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,409
Well, let me see...             

344
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,610
Oh, I know it.                  
I know it.                      

345
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:07,811
You know, my chauffeur's        

346
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,913
got a little one-bedroom        
apartment downtown.             

347
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:12,749
What do you say you             
and I go slumming?              

348
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:13,617
                Let me guess:   

349
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:16,570
        you're not really       
        rich at all, are you?   

350
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,971
Well, now,                      
define "rich."                  

351
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,072
I have my health.               

352
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:24,911
        I... uh, think I'll just
        stick with the drink.   

353
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,013
Let me get this straight:       

354
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,982
        when you thought        
that I was a millionaire,       

355
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:29,516
    you were ready to go out    
            with me,            

356
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,318
     but now that I'm just      
     a healthy bartender,       

357
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:33,354
    you don't want to have      
    anything to do with me.     

358
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:34,304
I gotta tell you, lady,         

359
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,123
that makes you                  
an incredibly shallow person.   

360
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,891
        Do you actually think   
        this sort of approach   

361
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:38,993
            is going to work?   

362
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:40,294
Absolutely.                     

363
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,663
You see, I'm an incredibly      
     shallow person myself.     

364
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,698
Between the two of us,          

365
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:47,468
        we couldn't make        
        a decent wading pool.   

366
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,102
        What do you say, huh?   

367
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,438
Don't I know you from somewhere?

368
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,573
                    Yeah, well, 
                    you probably

369
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,575
                 caught me out  
                 at Fenway, huh?

370
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:55,509
    Of course.                  

371
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:58,212
I bought a bag                  
of peanuts from you.            

372
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:07,120
Another round of brandies       
    for Butch and Sundance.     

373
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:11,058
They're really, uh,             
hitting it off, huh?            

374
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,359
                I should say so.

375
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:15,229
        They're in there        
        singing school songs.   

376
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:16,847
             If you hate Ivy    
             League fight songs,

377
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,918
         wait till you hear one 
         from bartending school.

378
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,703
     You're not taking this     
      very well, are you?       

379
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,338
            What, that little   
            backstabber?        

380
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,972
Oh, now cut that out.           

381
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:28,308
Woody took a big risk, you know.

382
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,711
You broke the vase and          
he took the blame for it.       

383
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:32,579
It didn't have                  
to turn out that way.           

384
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:34,481
     He just had your best      
    interest at heart.          

385
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,882
                I know.         

386
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,352
    I could just hug him till   
    his tongue turns black.     

387
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:48,062
     You know, I'm not convinced
     you're a millionaire,      

388
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:52,499
          but I am sold         
          on the eccentric part.

389
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,168
Well, that's a start.           

390
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:55,702
                 And since      
                 I'm not getting

391
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:57,371
         any interesting        
         nibbles tonight anyway,

392
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:59,806
            I'm reconsidering   
            your offer.         

393
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:03,127
Nibbles are my specialty.       

394
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,412
                Great.          

395
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,713
            Well, what time will
            you be getting off?

      Oh, listen, I've got      
to show you a trick shot.       

398
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,876
      Now you watch this.

402

                    Oh, uh...   

403

      You seem to have something
      in your eye, Woodhead.    

404
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,703
            I'll get it for you.

405

Oh, Pinky, stop!

414
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:54,244
          I tell you, you have  
          no idea how hard it is

            to find young fellas

            with your stuff     
            in this day and age.

417

    the buttoned-down brats     

418
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,820
        my granddaughter        
    drags home from college.

                She really      
                deserves someone

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,473
more solid, someone real.       

421
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,229
                Someone with    
                a strong back   

422
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,097

            you know?           

423
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:15,882
    Someone like you, Woody.    

424
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,785
  Thank you, sir. I couldn't.   

425
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,870
Yeah, I could.                  

426
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,676
        She's out in Vail right 
        now on a skiing holiday.

427
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:30,047
                 I'm going up   
                 there tomorrow.

     would be too happy...

         Oh, she'll be thrilled.

435
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:44,744
                 So, great, I'll
                 go tell Jamison

00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:46,213
to arrange it                   
right now.

00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:52,185

get these things?!

     Go figure, Miss Howe.      

440
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,525
  I mean, you break the vase,   

441
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,895
    and I end up being          
      the big boss' buddy.      

442
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,797
    Isn't life funny?           

443
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,499
Do you mean funny "ha-ha"       

444
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,068
 or funny "a living nightmare"? 

445
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,322
 Is something wrong, Miss Howe? 

446
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,040
    Yes, something is wrong.    

447
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,793
         I am the one who should
         be playing pool.       

448
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,194
          I'm the one who should
          be smoking cigars     
          and drinking brandy.  

449
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,547
          I'm the one who should
          be going out with     
          his granddaughter.    

450
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,568
        You know what I mean.   

451
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:25,819
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Howe.     

452
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,721
I was only trying to help.      

453
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:28,955
  Okay, Woody, we're all set.   

454
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:31,891
I'll stop by the bar tomorrow   
afternoon and pick you up.      

455
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,945
Pinky, I have a confession.     

456
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:39,216
I didn't break your vase.       
Miss Howe did.                  

457
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:43,403

         off my chest.          

458
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,191
    You broke my vase?          

459
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:50,811
            Well, actually, yes.

460
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:53,413
 That's the most cowardly thing 
    I have ever heard.          

461
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:57,217
 You'd let this fine young man  
         take the blame         

462
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,769
      for your clumsiness?      

463
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,837
I don't know,                   
Miss Howe.                      

464
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,405
I'm going to have               
to seriously reconsider         

465
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,209
your future with                
our organization.               

466
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:06,776
 Uh, Pinky, wait a minute here.

00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,179
         Uh, Miss Howe          
      is a very nice lady.

    she has a heart of gold.    

470
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:16,186
Well... well, all right.        

471
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,322
Woody, if you'll vouch          
for her, I'll give her          

472
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,825
another chance,                 
I guess.                        

473

the Old Smoothies,

didn't you?                     

483

Frasier.

those to Frasier?

who had the, uh, Playboy?
