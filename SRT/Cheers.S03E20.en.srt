1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,918
lF EVER l WOULD LEAVE YOU

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,837
Diane, are you ready?
lt's time for ''The Sorrow And The Pity''.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,310
Are you two going straight home to bed?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,436
You know it's a movie.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,958
Not just a movie. lt's the final feature
in the Human Brutality Film Festival.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,669
Sammy, when's the Coach
back from visiting his sister?

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,039
- He'll be in Minnesota another week.
- ls his sister anything like the Coach?

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,637
Let me put it this way. He asked her
to pick him up at the airport.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,557
She thought he meant the Boston airport
so she drove here to pick him up.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,875
Fortunately, that's what he meant.
They had lunch at the airport.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,713
Then they drove on to St. Paul.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,037
l thought she lived in Duluth.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,432
She does, but they don't like the food
at the airport in Duluth.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,037
Actually, Coach will probably be back
before l could explain this to you.

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,308
Let's get out of here.
All the goofs have gone home.

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,553
Nobody to laugh at or buy us beer.
l think our work here is done.

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,915
Amen.

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,350
ls that Carla's positively-disgusting
ex-husband Nick?

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,751
All right. Things are picking up, Cliffie.
Have a seat.

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,471
Hello, blondie. l bet you thought
you'd never see me again, right?

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,351
Change ''thought'' to ''begged God''
and you've got it exactly.

22
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,273
- Hey, Nick.
- Hello, Sam.

23
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,036
And the rest of you.

24
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,716
lt's so good to see some friendly faces.
My, can l use that now.

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,309
- ls something wrong?
- Yeah, but let's not dwell on it.

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,268
lt would tear your heart out.
ls Carla around?

27
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,319
- No, she went home for the night.
- Frasier, your tea is ready.

28
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,237
Nick Tortelli, this is someone with whom
you have absolutely nothing in common,

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,516
my paramour, Doctor Frasier Crane.

30
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,070
Doctor of what? Can you get any pills?

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,237
l'm a psychiatrist. Have we met?

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,076
Are you the bogus missing link exhibited
at the Amsterdam World's Fair?

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,358
No, but you're not the first person
who asked me.

34
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,832
l wish l had done that. Maybe my life
would be worth something.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,073
What's going on here?
What's the matter, Nick?

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,471
- You remember my wife, Loretta?
- Sure do. Tall. Blonde.

37
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,757
She ran out on me.
She always wanted to be a singer.

38
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,708
She got an offer from this big
musical group that's touring the country.

39
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,836
The Grinning Americans.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,956
The grinning what?

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,350
They're wholesome young people,

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,637
who wear pullover sweaters,
sing patriotic songs.

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,678
They've had me and Ma marching
around the living room

44
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,434
on more than one Sunday afternoon.

45
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,229
You live with your mother, Cliff?

46
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,517
l have my own room.
l have my own hot plate.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,956
You want to read
something sicko into that?

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,269
- You're not the first to lose a woman.
- You haven't heard the worst.

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,069
Loretta wouldn't marry me unless
l signed a pre-nuptial agreement

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,196
and put everything in her name.

51
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,669
l was up to my eyeballs
in <i>amore</i> that night.

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,957
She got the house
and the Tortelli Television Hospital.

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,237
- Let me get you a drink.
- l don't have anything.

54
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,630
- l couldn't pay.
- lt's on the house.

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,557
Nick Tortelli don't take charity or pity,
or soda. So make it neat, Sam.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,874
l forgot my purse. Nick.

57
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,353
- What the hell are you doing here?
- l came to see if l have any friends left.

58
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,479
Sorry, our new snail pellets
took care of them.

59
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,158
You look pretty, Carla.

60
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,751
The twinkie left you, didn't she?
She took you for everything, didn't she?

61
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,036
Tell me she took you for everything.

62
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,352
l was born into this world naked
and so shall l leave it.

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,910
Please stay fully-clothed
the rest of the time.

64
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,036
You got a guy, Carla?

65
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,873
No, l swallowed a beach ball.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,474
For your information,
l am not seeing anybody,

67
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,758
but the guy that knocked me up and ran
this time is ten times classier than you.

68
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,433
Get out.

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,673
l have no reason to expect any kindness
from you. l treated you like dirt.

70
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,229
But l've come back to start over again.

71
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,190
l would like to make it up to you and
my children, if you give me a chance.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,516
l don't know what to say, Nick.
Part of me wants to laugh in your face.

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,433
The rest of me wants to throw up.

74
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,789
Go with your heart.

75
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,473
Just how dumb do you think l am?

76
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,074
She kicks you out
and you expect me to believe

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,913
that you're a sweet guy
that wants to do right by me?

78
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,594
What would it take to convince you?

79
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,149
- Forget it.
- Wait.

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,437
l'm going to hold my hand over this
flame until you believe my sincerity.

81
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,673
Go ahead. l happen to be fond
of the smell of roast pig.

82
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,990
Yuck, he's going to do it.

83
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,555
Say you believe me and end my torment.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,912
Say, Nick, shouldn't you be putting it
a little closer down to the flame?

85
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,914
What, are there rules to this?

86
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,229
lt's plenty warm up here where it is.

87
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,996
Nick, you're roach droppings.
l never want to see you again in my life.

88
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,634
You're her friends.
You believe me, don't you?

89
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,756
You'll talk to her, won't you?

90
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,311
Diane, we've missed the Sorrow,
but maybe we can still catch the Pity.

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,270
Mr Tortelli, l hate to see any human
suffer without doing something to help.

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,513
l'd like you to call this number
any time, day or night.

93
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,549
- ls this your office?
- No, l'm far out of your price range.

94
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,917
This is the number of a promising
graduate student.

95
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,071
You could put him on the map.

96
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,398
- Good night, Sammy. Nick.
- See you later, Nick.

97
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,996
You fellas going home
to your warm beds?

98
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,394
Yup. That's where we're going.

99
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,074
You got a place to sleep tonight,
don't you?

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,917
- Yeah, in the gutter out front.
- Good. As long as you got a place.

101
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,557
They say people don't get involved, Cliff.

102
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,557
Nick, l'm afraid l'm going to have
to close up here.

103
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,190
l know. Just one more thing, Sam, OK?

104
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,875
Could l do a few odd jobs for you
for a few bucks?

105
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,396
Boy, l really don't need anything, Nick.

106
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,677
Sam, you don't understand.
l'll do anything.

107
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,149
A man without a job isn't a man, Sam.

108
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,029
l'll sweep, l'll clean, l'll get on my knees
and scrub the place.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,953
The place will be spotless, Sam. Please

110
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,914
Sam, thank you.

111
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,470
Thank you. God bless you, Sam.

112
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,950
- The broom's in the closet.
- Tonight?

113
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,839
That's a little short notice.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,956
l'll do it.

115
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,389
Hello, Miss Carla.
You're looking mighty pretty today.

116
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,315
- But that railing looks terrible.
- Terrible? l can see my face in it.

117
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,994
That's what l mean. So can l.

118
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,397
l told you, if he's bothering you,
l'll get rid of him.

119
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,917
l don't care what he does.
l enjoy seeing him grovel around.

120
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,753
Carla, God knows
l was as sceptical as you are,

121
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,391
but the man has been working here
for three weeks.

122
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,315
He's rented a room with a sink.
He's joined a Christian support group.

123
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,313
He's teaching himself
to play the harmonica.

124
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,397
lsn't it possible that he's changed?

125
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,588
He's also clipped his fingernails and he's
talked about subscribing to a magazine.

126
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,118
But you look beyond the glitter and flash,
that's the same old Nick.

127
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,397
He's doing this to impress me,
so l'll take him back.

128
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,358
ls that such a bad idea? l'm just asking.

129
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,911
He may be starting to pull the wool over
your eyes, but he's not doing it to me.

130
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,356
lf l take him back, l'll end up getting hurt.

131
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,478
l won't be the one to argue his case,

132
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,236
but in the interest of human charity,
perhaps you should keep an open mind.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,391
ln the interest of human charity,

134
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,757
l wouldn't walk across the room
to spit on his shoes.

135
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,876
Pardon me, common scrub person,
is there a Nick Tortelli here?

136
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,953
- Loretta.
- Nick, is that you?

137
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,556
No, it's the Archbishop of Canterbury.

138
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,554
- So you couldn't stay away from me?
- The very idea is ludicrous.

139
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,271
We've simply outgrown each other.
l'm living in the fast lane now.

140
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,989
l hobnob with people
you wouldn't even feel comfortable with.

141
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,833
Last night l met a head waiter.

142
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,478
So you came to rub my nose in it, right?

143
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,596
Hi, gang at Cheers.

144
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,390
Just because l've given Nick the boot
doesn't mean that we can't be friends.

145
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,678
Especially you, Carla. After all,
we did have Nick Tortelli in common.

146
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,913
Yeah, you, me and 1 ,000 head lice.

147
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,591
- What are you doing here?
- These are the divorce papers.

148
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,992
Read them and sign them.
And please, let's not make this sticky.

149
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,233
lf you think l'm going to give you any
argument about this, you're nuts.

150
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,513
l'm over you, Loretta.
Carla won't give me the time of day yet,

151
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,753
but l'd rather be scrubbing the floor
that she walks on,

152
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,434
than scrubbing the floor that you walk on.

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,034
That wasn't too good,
but you get the picture.

154
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,153
l'm glad to hear
that you're over me, Nick,

155
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,757
because as far as l'm concerned,
you're yesterday's newspapers.

156
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,389
Well, goodbye, gang at Cheers.

157
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,916
l'm sorry you had to witness
this ugly scene.

158
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,230
Beat it!

159
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,915
And that, Carla, if you'll excuse me
for ending a sentence in a preposition,

160
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,234
is a man whose shoes you wouldn't
cross the room to spit upon.

161
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,517
What can l say, Diane? l was wrong.

162
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,471
lt's a start.

163
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,594
- May l take your coat, Miss Carla?
- Knock it off, Nick.

164
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,671
Please, for me.

165
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,994
Shame on me. This coat rack needs
to be sanded down and varnished.

166
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,591
- So you and Nick took the kids out?
- Yeah. lt was Nick's idea.

167
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,514
We took them to the petting zoo,
so they could slap the animals.

168
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,237
Listen, tonight after work, me and you,
what do you say, like the old times?

169
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,234
We'll go to the White Castle,
get burgers and catch some wrestling?

170
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,630
There's a couple of grudge matches.

171
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,033
Forget it. l'd enjoy that with a classy guy,
but you and l aren't happening.

172
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,679
Carla, what do l have to do?
Don't you believe that people change?

173
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,198
You hit rock bottom, then you've got to
change or there's no living with yourself.

174
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,433
Sam understands that.
He was a stinking drunk.

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,637
l had a problem, Nick.

176
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,717
Miss Diane understands.
She's hustling hooch now.

177
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,908
lt wasn't too long ago she was strapped
to a bed in the drooling academy.

178
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,637
lt was only once that l was restrained
to my bed for my own safety

179
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,598
when psychotropic drugs
affected my balance.

180
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,309
That was only for a week and a half,
l was told.

181
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,756
Anyway,
what are we talking about me for?

182
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,673
Carla, why will you not relent?

183
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,150
Because l don't believe you have it
in you to be true to me.

184
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,198
lf Loretta came back,
you would go to her.

185
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,717
You're going to believe me one day
and l'm going to hang in until you do.

186
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,513
lf you'll excuse me, l have to finish oiling
the coasters on Sam's office chair.

187
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,069
Fixing the big wheel's little wheels.

188
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,879
l appreciate it, Nick.

189
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,718
Carla, Cliff and l took alley-oop there
to the drive-in over the weekend.

190
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,316
All he could talk about was you.
Miss Carla this. Miss Carla that.

191
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,918
l am tired of hearing all of you
defending that walking hairball.

192
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,196
You want to see
why l don't fall for his act?

193
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,874
OK, watch.

194
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,315
What's the extension in your office?

195
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,994
Two...two, one.

196
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,434
Nick? This is Loretta.

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,390
l've been getting some of those old
feelings again, daddy.

198
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,472
l think we should get together and talk.

199
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,949
l'm at the Baldwin Hotel.

200
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,468
- How soon could you come over...?
- l've got to get some cigarettes.

201
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,713
- You don't smoke.
- l'm going to start. l heard good things.

202
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,956
No. l'm not going to go.

203
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,634
You know where l was going?

204
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,874
Loretta called me and she wanted to talk
to me. And l was about to go.

205
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,190
Then you know what happened?

206
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,148
l thought of you
and l came to my senses.

207
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,753
That wasn't Loretta, Nick.
That was Carla on the phone.

208
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,238
- That was you?
- Yes, daddy.

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,788
That was a test
and l passed with flying colours.

210
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,474
Now do you believe me?

211
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,794
Carla, how can you stand there

212
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,397
and deny the man burgers and wrestling
with the woman he loves?

213
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,434
- He knew it was me on the phone.
- Carla, what more can l do?

214
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,955
That wasn't a good enough test.

215
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,076
Hi, Carla. Hi, Nick.
Hi, gang at Cheers.

216
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,193
- The real Loretta.
- Surprise.

217
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,750
- What do you want?
- l want you back.

218
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,033
What?

219
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,274
Well, this isn't easy to say
and l don't know what song it's from,

220
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,595
but there's a line in some song that
goes, ''l've got you under my skin.''

221
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,955
l've Got You Under My Skin, Loretta.

222
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,591
What?
No, this is going to complicate things.

223
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,236
No, l was just telling you
the name of the song.

224
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,233
Pardon me.

225
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,914
Nick, what l'm trying to say is,

226
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,153
do you think there's ever a chance
that we'll get back together again?

227
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,436
ln my heart l knew this day would come.

228
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,594
The other day when l was here with the
papers, something stirred inside of me.

229
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,877
Back at the hotel room,
all l could think about is the way

230
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,795
you used to make me pour Amaretto
in your chin dimple so l could sip it out.

231
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,957
l've got so much to learn from this man.

232
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,757
Loretta, l don't feel anything for you
any more. You hear me? Nothing.

233
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,309
But you said you'd always love me.

234
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,074
l'm a complex guy.

235
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,228
You can say no to my words,
but can you say no to this?

236
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,949
l've got another one
where this came from.

237
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,231
You're making a fool out of yourself.
Beat it.

238
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,393
This is one American who's going to
have trouble grinning on stage tonight.

239
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,832
Bravo.

240
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,708
Well, l have some oiling to complete.

241
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,358
ln God's name, what more do you want?

242
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,311
lt is the most startling metamorphoses
one man has ever undergone.

243
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,993
You're all experts on Nick Tortelli?

244
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,037
You all think l should go back with him?

245
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,079
Not me. l don't think
you're good enough for him.

246
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,554
OK.

247
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,953
l'm going to take him back.
You all watch what's going happen.

248
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,479
- Nick, can l speak to you?
- Yes, Miss Carla.

249
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,593
Nick, l want you back.

250
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,311
l want to give you another chance
to take care of me and the kids.

251
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,517
Carla, you've made me
the happiest man on Earth.

252
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,797
Let's go to White Castle and celebrate!

253
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,273
l knew l'd get you back if l kept mopping
and cleaning the ashtrays and believing.

254
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,115
But l've got to tell you,
that last test was the hardest.

255
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,236
Test, Nick?

256
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,949
The way you actually got Loretta
to come here and do what she did.

257
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,429
l don't know how you did it.

258
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,950
lt wasn't a test, Nick.

259
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,198
- lt wasn't?
- No.

260
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,672
- She really wants me back?
- That's right.

261
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,518
Well, good. l'm glad to see
that you're above that sort of thing.

262
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,993
lt's you and me...forever.

263
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,239
Really, Nick? l can't believe it.

264
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,154
What's the matter?

265
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,711
l don't know. Something weird, Carla.

266
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,189
l can't control my body.

267
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,998
l don't know what's going on.

268
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,153
l'm going to find a cure for this,
if it kills me.

269
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,392
Goodbye, Carla. l love you.

270
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,710
Loretta!

271
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,868
On the way over to the bar this morning,
l saw this amazing cloud formation.

272
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,157
lt looked like a flock of sheep.
lt was really...

273
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,713
Satisfied? You're all ignorant.

274
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,871
Carla, l'm sorry.
l don't know what to say.

275
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,558
We made a terrible mistake.

276
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,678
But our regret is tempered
by our pride in you.

277
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,798
You didn't fall for him. You didn't give in.

278
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,952
You stayed strong
and you came out on top.

279
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,510
This is your day, Carla. Rejoice.

280
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,638
Yeah, this is my day,
except for one thing.

281
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,554
l love the monkey more now
than l ever did.

282
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,551
That monkey?

283
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,594
lt's crazy, isn't it?

284
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,873
l don't think it is. Listen to me.

285
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,194
What you're feeling right now for Nick,
every woman has felt it sometime.

286
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,797
We all fall for some guy
that we know isn't good for us.

287
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,080
We need excitement.
We need a walk on the wild side.

288
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,309
l know whereof l speak.

289
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,474
Believe it or not, there are times l'm
irresistibly drawn to that damn Sam...

290
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,399
...urai...Samurai Frasier Crane.

291
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,394
Warrior of Love.

292
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,596
That's what l call him.

293
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,389
Samurai Frasier Crane.

294
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,715
