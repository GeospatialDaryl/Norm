00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,100
        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,300
      Well, Rebecca, how are you
        on this magnificent day?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,100
None of your business.          

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,900
         (imitating John Wayne):
          Well, who stuck a burr
    under your saddle, missy?   

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,800
 Sorry, Frasier, I've just been 
     in a bad mood lately.      

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,100
         Would you like         
    to talk about it?           

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,700
         It might help          
 to alleviate your depression.  

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,300
No, I really wouldn't feel      
  comfortable talking to you.   

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,500
          Why is that?          

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,400
  Because you know me too well  
 to think of me as a therapist? 

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,200
     No, because I saw you      
     dance around this bar      

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,400
    in your underwear, with     
  swizzle sticks in your ears,  

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,500
     when they brought back     
         Classic Coke.          

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
         Well, granted,         
  that wasn't my finest hour,   

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,700
    but you <i>can</i> taste           
        the difference.         

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,200
                Now, Rebecca,   

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,800
counseling people is what I do. 

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,400
    Please let me help you.     

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,300
(sighing):                      
All right, Frasier.             

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,900
It's just that I can't seem     
to make anything work.          

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,900
  Robin is in prison.           

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
I manage this crummy bar.       

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,000
My career is                    
at a standstill.                

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm miserable.                  
I'm lonely.                     

25
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,100
            And now,            
  I have to sell my Mercedes.   

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,800
                 I see.         

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,200
         Well, I'll, uh...      
      I'll give you $5,000 cash 

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
             and take over      
             your payments.     

29
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,800
     Six thousand firm.         
                        Deal.   

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,900
      Thank you.                

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,300
                 Damn!          
        It's good to heal.      

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,100
      (theme song begins)       

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,600
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
 Takes everything you've got  

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,100
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
 Sure would help a lot         

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away           

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,700
   Sometimes you want to go    

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,200
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,800
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,600
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,900
  You wanna be where everybody 
    knows your name            

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,300
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,900
   People are all the same     

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,900
  You wanna go where everybody 
    knows your name.

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,500
                  You know, Sam,
                this is a treat.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,400
              I've got this side
        of the bar to myself.   

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,300
             I can drink my beer
          and enjoy my newspaper

51
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,800
    without being pummeled on   
    every side by inane chatter.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
     Yep.                       

53
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,000
          Say, look...          
      well, look at this.       

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
  There is barometric pressure  
        on Venus.               

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,600
          Now, how did          
    they measure that?          

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
        Beats me.               

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,700
  A man was reunited with his   
  twin brother after 30 years.  

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,400
    They worked in the same     
 auto plant in Columbus, Ohio!  

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
          That's nice.          

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,600
 Say, would anybody like me to  
read their, uh, their horoscope?

61
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
  I'll, uh, start with Aries.   

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
     Somebody want to play      
     with Frasier, please?      

63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
        Hi, Sammy.              

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
        Sorry I'm late.         

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,000
There's a prison work crew      
 in the park across the street. 

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,900
Man, you should have heard      
some of those raunchy,          
sleazy, come-ons.               

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
                Pretty bad, huh?
  Oh, yeah.                     

68
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,100
I really outdid myself.         

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,500
I should write a book.          

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,300
Hey, Becks, you know, you might 
     be interested to know      

71
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,000
that one of those cons          
      out there                 

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,800
 is your pasty-faced,           
billionaire boyfriend.          

73
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,700
                     Robin?     
Yeah.                           

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
He was out there                
picking up trash.               

75
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,600
    I wonder if he was using    
 the same line he used on you.  

76
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
            My poor, sweet baby.

77
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,800
      I better go see him.      

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,800
        Oh, wait--              
    no, I better not.           

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,800
 If the other guys get jealous, 
they might give him a hard time.

80
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,200
But then,                       
if I don't go see him,          

81
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,500
then he'll probably think       
    that I'm ashamed of him.    

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,200
 But if I see him, it might be  
    all too painful for him.    

83
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
    What should I do?           
         I don't know.          

84
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,100
    What do you think           
          I should do?          

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,900
Twins in the same               
auto plant?                     

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
    Come on, you guys.          

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
      You just don't care.      

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,400
Honey, I'm trying               
like hell to care.              

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,100
Look, if it means               
that much to you,               

90
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
why don't you run outside       
there and blow him a kiss.      

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,400
          Yeah, right.          

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
  Get him in trouble so he has  
 to spend the night in the box. 

93
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,400
        (sarcastically):        
        Blow him a kiss.        

94
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,100
     You heartless bastard.     

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,400
  Boy, it must be pretty rough  
on ol' Robin Colcord, huh?      

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,100
      One day he's living       
        in a penthouse,         

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,400
  the next day he's picking up  
      trash with a stick.       

98
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,200
             You're loving this,
              aren't you, Sammy?

99
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
         Every minute.          

100
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,600
        Sam, you missed         
         a great lunch.         

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,900
  Mr. Clavin and Mr. Peterson   
treated me at the Hungry Heifer.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,900
                            SAM:
                     How was it?

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
  Wednesday Ribscapade, Sammy.  

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,300
         End of story.          

105
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
                Well, where's   
                the third member

106
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,700
             of your gastronomic
                  suicide squad?

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,300
Mr. Peterson's                  
still at the Heifer.            

108
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,900
         Uh, you know,          
     we got some bad news.      

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
         They're gonna          
      tear the place down.      

110
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,600
        Oh, dear!               

111
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,600
 Well, I can see why Norm would 
want to spend some final moments

112
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,100
 of contemplation in the place  
that meant so much to him.      

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,900
      No, no, he was just       
     sopping up some gravy      

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,400
with a Parker House roll.       

115
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,400
     Well, each man mourns      
        in his own way.         

116
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,100
        I hope it doesn't       
        hit him too hard.       

117
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
            What's the big deal?

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,300
             So they're leveling
             another beef joint.

119
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,200
Another beef joint?             

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
You obviously                   
have never been there           

121
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
for "You Keep                   
the Hoof" night.                

122
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, you know, this is         
not atypical behavior.          

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
      I mean, many people       
    can form emotional bonds    

124
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,400
     to significant places      
        in their lives.         

125
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,300
     I think we should all      
    be very sensitive           

126
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,800
          to what Norm          
    is going through.           

127
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
             Yeah, you know,    
    that's a good idea, Fras.   

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
Maybe we shouldn't say anything 
         to remind him          

129
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,700
      of the Hungry Heifer      
    when he comes back here.    

130
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,700
You know, maybe not say         
any words like, uh,             
"beef" or "meat."               

131
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
          Sam, what about "meet"
              as in, "Let's meet
            for dinner tonight?"

132
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,300
         Yeah.                  
That'd be fine, Woody.          

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
                 Great.         
      W-Where do you want to go?

134
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,100
          You feel like Chinese?

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,300
You know, on second thought,    
maybe that's not a good idea.   

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,100
             That's why I asked.

137
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,200
     Afternoon, everybody.      

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
                          GROUP:
                        Norm!   

139
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,900
 Hey, how's life treatin' you,  
          there, Norm?          

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,300
          Beats me...           

141
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,900
            then it kicks me and
             leaves me for dead.

142
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,200
Well, here's a... here's a      
 cold one for you there, buddy. 

143
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,400
Hey, uh, Norm,                  

144
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,200
how about some of these         
extra-salty pretzels            

145
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,900
you so heartily                 
enjoy, huh?                     

146
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
  You're welcome to share some  
 of my beer nuts, if you like.  

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,400
     Meat!                      

148
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,400
        (all clamoring)         

149
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,700
Aw, everybody was               
thinking it!                    

150
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,600
I was the only one who          
had the guts to say it!         

151
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
    We're sorry, man.           

152
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
    We-We-We feel bad           
    'cause we know how much     

153
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
the Hungry Heifer means to you. 

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
         You don't know         
     the half of it, Sammy.     

155
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,400
    I love the Heifer.          

156
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,800
SAM:                            
Aww...                          

157
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,000
  Don't know what I'm gonna do  
      without that place.       

158
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,300
      It was like my home       
    away from Cheers.           

159
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,700
If you'll excuse me, guys, I... 

160
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,300
     just want to be alone.     

161
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,800
                  Hey, whoa! Ho.

162
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,300
                 Not that alone.

163
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,600
     Well, they're carting      
         the cons away.         

164
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,400
        Robin's leaving?        

165
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
     Yeah, just loaded him      

166
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,800
  and his sunburned pals        
      into the van.             

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Mm, he was red as a lobster.    

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,700
  Bet he blisters.              

169
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
                Carla, honey,   
        I don't think Rebecca   

170
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
             wants to talk about
                 this right now.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
              I mean, after all,
              her guy's in jail.

172
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,200
        I mean, she's lonely,   
                  she's hurting.

173
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,600
          She's a woman in need.

174
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,300
             She misses her man.

175
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,100
        (sighing):              
        I do, Sam. I do.        

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,300
Say, hon...                     

177
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
I just want to say that...      

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,200
I know what you're going through
        right now,              

179
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,200
and if there's anything         
  I can do for you,             

180
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,500
    or <i>to</i> you...                

181
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
I'm here for you.               

182
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Or there for you or on          
the floor for you, it's...      

183
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
                Gee, Sam.       

184
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,600
      When you put it like that,
          you make me sick.     

185
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Well, you think about it,       
            though--            

186
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,900
 I mean, 'cause you're thinking 
      about it right now.       

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,900
    I bet if I took an X-ray    
         of your brain,         

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,700
      I'd be lying, right       
    stretched out all naked.    

189
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,100
             Don't leave out the
                tag on your toe.

190
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
         Would that tag         
         happen to say:         

191
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,800
    "For a good time,           
    follow this leg?"           

192
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,300
          (laughing):           
             Whee!              

193
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,900
        I sure know how         
  to make my own fun, don't I?  

194
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
        Guys, look, uh, sorry   
     I was getting all emotional

195
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
                about the Hungry
            Heifer, I mean...   

196
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,600
Aw...                           

197
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,800
                  It's just that
            I'm losing someplace

198
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,200
                 that's so close
                    to my heart.

199
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,900
         Don't you mean         
      clogging your heart?      

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Well, Norm, there <i>are</i>          
 other restaurants.             

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,300
                        NORM:   
                It's not just   
                 the restaurant,

202
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
     it's the owner, okay?      

203
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,200
          Sid Nelson.           

204
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
He's a funny kind of guy,       
        you know?               

205
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,700
 He's all tough on the outside, 

206
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,800
but really soft and mushy       
         on the inside.         

207
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,600
Hmm. Not unlike his entire menu.

208
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
     Anyway, Sid was always     
         there for me.          

209
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,300
  Not unlike his entire menu.   

210
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,500
                  I remember one
            time, in college,   

211
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,200
      I had to stay up all night
         to finish a term paper.

212
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,400
        Sid stayed up with me   
            till we finished it.

213
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
        We also finished        
    a two-pound onion loaf.     

214
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,200
 Well, Norm, I don't blame you  
      for being depressed.      

215
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
                No... depressed?

216
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
                Come on.        

217
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,800
        You know, life's only   
        temporary anyway, right?

218
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,600
            When you're born,   
        blah-blah-blah, you die.

219
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,900
Geez, Norm, I-I look at you and 
  I see a man at a crossroads.  

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
  This may be your very first   
     brush with mortality,      

221
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,000
            with the temporal   
            nature of things.   

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
                    You may feel
                     futile now,

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
              but there are ways
                 to combat that.

224
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,100
Yeah? How?                      

225
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
        Well, by guaranteeing   
        your own immortality.   

226
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,900
            By leaving your mark
                on the world.   

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
            He always leaves two
             dents on the stool.

228
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,800
                Carla, please.  

229
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,500
                  Well, he does!
                  Big ones, too!

230
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
                    When he goes
                  home at night,

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
                this stool looks
        like it has a Mohawk!   

232
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,500
              Look, I was hoping
                for something   

233
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
         a little more          
life-affirming, thank you!      

234
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Now, Norm, there are... there   
     are many roads open to you.

235
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
              Geez, you... well,
          you could do something

236
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,700
                to help save the
                  Hungry Heifer.

237
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
    Or, well, better yet, you   
         could help do something
            to save yourself!   

238
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,400
        Turn over a new leaf.   

239
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,800
    You could diet, exercise,   
    work for a charitable cause.

240
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,800
                 Or, if you want
                the ultimate way

241
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
                 of guaranteeing
            your immortality,   

242
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,200
    go home to Vera and start   
     a family right this minute.

243
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Frasier... you are right.       

244
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
    When you're right,          
      you are right!            

245
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
    I am gonna do it!           

246
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,200
    (friends shouting           
         encouragement)         

247
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,300
I'm gonna save                  
the Hungry Heifer!              

248
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
     Well, what about, uh,      
    dieting, exercise,          

249
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,600
    making a baby with Vera?    

250
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,900
             Pfft!              
        You do it.              

251
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
      Hey, Sammy.               
                 Hey.           

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,700
          Here you go.          

253
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,700
                            SAM:
                 Enjoy yourself?

254
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Ho-ho, yeah!                    

255
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
 I tell you, you haven't lived  
until you've washed a car       

256
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,700
          in front of           
a bunch of drooling cons.       

257
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,100
            (laughs)            
Ooh!                            

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,500
  Just like in <i>Cool Hand Luke!</i>  
              Whoo!             

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Here you go, Fras.              

260
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,500
        Thank you.              

261
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,800
What do we got here now?        

262
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
             Uh, Joe... Marty...

263
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,400
                     Who had the
              powder-blue Caddy?

264
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,600
                 Carla, how's it
                going out there?

265
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,400
      How does Robin look?      
Okay.                           

266
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,800
He was being pushed around by   
this big old hunk of a guard.   

267
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,500
    His name is Vince           
  and he has got some muscles,  

268
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
        I'm telling you.        

269
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,900
He could snap Robin's neck      
like a number-two pencil.       

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
              But he didn't hurt
                Robin, did he?  

271
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,800
        I mean, Robin's okay,   
                 isn't he?      

272
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, sure, whatever.           

273
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
 Anyway, then this, uh, Vince,  

274
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,400
      he gets a load of me      
     and my bucket of suds      

275
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,700
     and he starts flexing.     

276
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,000
          But Robin-- Robin-- he
         gets dehydrated easily.

277
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
      Robin, Robin, Robin.      

278
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
 So your boyfriend's in prison! 
            Boo-hoo!            

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,600
    Can't you be happy          
for someone else for a change?! 

280
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
    Hey, don't listen to her.   

281
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
             She's trying to get
                under your skin.

282
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,300
         I can see how much this
            must be hurting you.

283
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,100
            Watching the man you
        love out there in the   
                sun all day long

284
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,900
              picking up garbage

285
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,000
        while a whole city looks
      at him, and laughs at him.

286
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,200
        Thanks for              
      understanding, Sam.       
                     Yeah.      

287
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,600
            You really do relish
        this, don't you, Sam?   

288
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,500
Every single minute.            

289
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,700
         Come on, stop          
         moping around.         

290
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,700
  Look, why don't you do what   
any woman would do for her man--

291
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,600
         strip to your skivvies,
         grab a chamois and wash
            a couple of cars.   

292
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
             Get your front wet.

293
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,200
I don't think Robin             
would respond                   

294
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,000
to something cheap              
like that.                      

295
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
            Oh, yeah? You should
              have seen how fast

296
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
                 he stabbed that
            trash when I did it.

297
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,300
FRASIER:                        
Hey, uh, Norm,                  

298
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
how's it going with the petition
    to save the Heifer, huh?    

299
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,300
    Great. Got a hundred more   
          signatures back there.
Hey, all right.                 

300
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
  Although I am getting a little
          bit of writer's cramp.

301
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,900
    Well, I wish you            
    luck, Mr. P.                
                        Yeah?   

302
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,900
  I know how hard it is to get  
people to sign a petition.      

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,100
                Yeah, I remember
              back in Hanover...

304
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,100
    I tried to gather signatures
  to rebuild the town band shell

305
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,300
                after the Fourth
              of July explosion.

306
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
         I had a heck of a time.

307
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
             I couldn't even get
        my Uncle Elwood to sign.

308
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,800
Oh. Couldn't even               
convince your uncle, huh?       

309
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,600
        Oh, he was convinced.   

310
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,000
                He just couldn't
                grip the pen.   

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
                    See, he was,
                he was in charge

312
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,800
of lighting                     
the fireworks.                  

313
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
            They had extra small
    fuses that year. No-no...   

314
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,500
            Time to pound       
            the pavement.       

315
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,200
         If I get like          
a hundred more signatures,      

316
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,300
I can bring this petition       
    over to City Hall.          

317
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,600
         Good for you.          

318
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,900
    Frasier, you were           
    absolutely right.           

319
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
    This feels right.           
    This feels great.           

320
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
  It's been a long time since   

321
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
I pounded the bricks            

322
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
          for a cause.          

323
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,200
    Oh I can't stand thinking   
              of Robin out there

324
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,200
in the blazing sun.             

325
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
        Aw, honey, well,        
      I'll tell you what,       

326
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
let me, uh, let me put on       
      a song here for you,      

327
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,900
 take your mind off of things.  

328
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
No, Sam, that's                 
not gonna work.                 

329
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,900
            All right, go ahead.
                It doesn't...   

330
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,400
      ...situation thought     
     I could take them...      

331
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,200
Dang it, Sam, turn it off.      

332
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,100
     For a while, baby...      

333
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,500
  Is that your idea of a song   
that's gonna cheer me up?       

334
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,100
Well, hey, it's got             
a great beat.                   

335
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
It's easy to pick               
up trash to.                    

336
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
    You just can go on          
with your stupid little idiotic 

337
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,000
           nasty jokes          
     because you know what?     

338
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,900
I love Robin and I'm going      
    to remain loyal to him,     

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
like it says right there,       

340
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,700
      B-14, "Stand By Your Man."

341
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,900
 I'm just sitting here in...  

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,200
   For a while, baby, I never  
thought I could wait...        

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,200
     I'm just sitting here     
            in...              

344
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,300
   For a while, baby, I never  
thought I could wait...        

345
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
     Cliff, you want to go      
    shoot some stick?           

346
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
                Let's shoot some
                  stick, Doctor.

347
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,500
     Oh, hey, before you go     
     back there, Dr. Crane,     

348
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
     I should tell you that     
    Carla's keeping a guard     

349
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,500
    on the pool table.          

350
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,700
Why is she doing that?          

351
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
     I guess she likes him.     

352
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
     Afternoon, everybody.      

353
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

354
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
     Hey, how would a beer      
      feel, Mr. Peterson?       

355
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,900
            Pretty nervous if   
              I was in the room.

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,600
             In fact, let me buy
     a beer for everybody, okay?

357
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
        All right!              
        Thank you, Norm!        

358
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,800
              Guys, I have saved
              the Hungry Heifer.

359
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,200
         (all cheering)         

360
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,600
That's great.                   
How'd you do it?                

361
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,600
            Well, I went over to
        City Hall to drop off   
             the petition right?

362
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,600
                Stopped in to do
              a little research.

363
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
            It turns out that   
            the Hungry Heifer   

364
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,400
     is the only building on the
         entire Eastern Seaboard

365
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
    that has a giant red-eyed   
steam-snorting bull on the roof.

366
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,300
  What about Hub's Steak Hut?   

367
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
                      It's gone.

368
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,300
      Well, Lucky Chucky's      
          Chuck House?          

369
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
            Struck by lightning.

370
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,900
Bill's Place for Steak?         

371
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,100
                         Stolen.

372
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,500
      Wow. That really is       
    the end of an era.          

373
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
Yeah.                           
Wonder who's next.              

374
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Are they gonna take down        
those big buckets of chicken?   

375
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
There's a message in            
this for the Big Boy:           

376
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,200
get rid of those overalls       
and get a real job.             

377
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Yeah. You know who doesn't      
         have to worry?         

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,300
             Denny.             

379
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
          Nobody knows          
      what he looks like.       

380
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,800
 Oh, sorry, was that out loud?  

381
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,500
                        NORM:   
                Anyway, the city
                    planner's   

382
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
                office issued   
          a temporary injunction

383
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,900
          against any demolition

384
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
      until it can be determined
    whether the Hungry Heifer   

385
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,800
                 can be declared
            a roadside landmark.

386
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,600
Oh, congratulations, Norm.      

387
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,300
                Gentlemen, start
                your enzymes.   

388
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,100
          (chanting):           
    Norm. Norm. Norm.           

389
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,700
         Norm. Norm...          
            Yeah, yeah, yeah.   

390
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm gonna invite you guys all   
to the Hungry Heifer tonight.   

391
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,800
 Well, what was supposed to be  
  a sad little farewell dinner  

392
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,700
is gonna turn into the happiest 
 meal of Mr. Sid Nelson's life. 

393
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,500
Everyone's gonna be there, guys.

394
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,900
  Even the Big Eaters Circle.   

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,900
             You in that, Mr. P?

396
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,300
Oh, no, no, Woody, please.      

397
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,700
    This is a closed table.     

398
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,300
I mean, someone has to die      
before you can get a seat there.

399
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,300
                Wow, too bad.   

400
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,100
Oh, no. These guys              
drop dead                       

401
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
    like once a week.           

402
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,000
      I've got a real shot      
        at it, I think.         

403
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,800
              Say, honey, I hate
        to bother you, you know,

404
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
         with Robin on your mind
                 and everything,

405
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
            but I just bought   
            some new clothes.   

406
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
              I'd like a woman's
                  point of view.

407
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
     Fine. Let's see them.      

408
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,600
         Hit it, Fras.          

409
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,100
 Our model, Sam, is sporting    

410
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,500
the latest in "big house" chic. 

411
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,400
                This ensemble   

412
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,100
                      is equally
                     appropriate

413
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,500
for playing the harmonica       
    or just crushing rocks.     

414
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,300
 It comes complete with anklet  

415
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
and matching                    
trash ka-bob,                   

416
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,300
                 made popular by
        billionaire swindler,   

417
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,200
    Robin Colcord.              

418
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,600
  You think you're hilarious,   
        don't you, Sam?         

419
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,700
    Well, I bring the party     
    with me, don't I, babe?     

420
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,100
Optional with this outfit       
is a matching set of,           

421
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,300
uh, tattoos reading:            
"Born to Raise Hell"            

422
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,500
and, uh, "It's                  
Society's Fault."               

423
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,200
 You guys, don't encourage him. 

424
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
            Guys, guys, guys,   
                look at this.   

425
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,900
                Quick impression
            of Robin Colcord.   

426
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,400
    (British accent):           
            Blimey.             

427
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,800
     There's a lot of trash     
  on the ground, isn't there?   

428
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,200
  Well, I'll just have to impale
it and flush it down the loo.   

429
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,700
                            Cor.

430
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,900
 Look, it's all over the place. 

431
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,900
  Look at that. Look at that.   
         Look at that.          

432
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,900
            All right, that's   
                it. Let's go.   

433
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,500
             You're spending the
            night in the box.   

434
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,500
    (laughing)                  

435
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,800
                     What're you
             talking about, man?

436
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Hey, what're you doing?         

437
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm not one of                  
your prisoners.                 

438
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,100
                 I know, but you
                stabbed my foot.

439
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,600
                And I got a gun.

440
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,900
              So you're spending
        the night in the box.   

441
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
    It was an accident.         

442
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,600
I didn't mean... Guys, do       
 something, will you, Rebecca?  

443
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,900
                      Okay, Sam.

444
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,000
   I'm just sitting here...   

445
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
        Oh, great.              

446
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,300
      She's got a problem.      

447
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,000
                Okay, all right.

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,300
            Attention please.   
                    (banging)   

449
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,300
    Attention please.           

450
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,900
      Okay, before we get       
        to the ceremony,        

451
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
        I'd like to make        
     a little announcement.     

452
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,300
      Because of tonight's      
     very special occasion,     

453
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,700
  the fudge volcano will keep   
  erupting for one more hour.   

454
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,200
    (cheering and applause)     

455
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,800
 All right, there we go, yeah.  

456
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,000
             Okay.              

457
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,400
     The Big Eaters Circle.     
        All right.              

458
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,500
Now, I'd like to introduce      
         to you folks,          

459
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,500
     the owner and operator     
     of the Hungry Heifer,      

460
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,600
our very special guest,         
Mr. Sid Nelson.                 

461
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,700
        (cheering)              

462
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
          (chanting):           
      Sid. Sid. Sid. Sid.       

463
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,500
         Sid. Sid. Sid.         

464
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
          Sid. Sid...           

465
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Let me get right                
to the point, Sid.              

466
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,300
I knew you were expecting       
a tearful farewell              
dinner here tonight,            

467
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,900
but, uh, that is                
not going to happen.            

468
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
  What are you talking about?   

469
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,300
Well, the Hungry Heifer is      
not going to be torn down.      

470
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,100
  What are you talking about?   

471
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
                        NORM:   
                    Perhaps this
                  piece of paper

472
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
will help explain               
things, Sid.                    

473
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,700
This is an injunction,          

474
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,800
making the Hungry Heifer        
immune to any wrecking ball.    

475
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,500
It will be here for our children
and our children's children.    

476
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,600
Sid obviously wasn't prepared   
            for this happy news.

477
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
    Uh, tell you what, uh...    

478
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
    have the band strike up     
      another tune, okay?       

479
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,100
    Oh, the band felt           
    bloated and left.           

480
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,000
  You've got to pace yourself.  

481
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,900
        Sid.                    

482
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Sid, what are you doing?.       

483
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,100
You could start                 
a grease fire in here.          

484
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean, I know you              
have them every day,            

485
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,800
but this one could              
get out of hand.                

486
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,900
                You jerk. You   
              ruined everything.

487
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
But I thought                   
you'd be happy.                 

488
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,300
            Happy? Why should   
                     I be happy?

489
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,700
    The developers were going   
          to give me three times
    what this joint is worth.   

490
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,800
I didn't know you wanted        
out of this place, Sid.         

491
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,300
        Why?                    

492
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,000
        How would you like to   
         spend seven days a week

493
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,000
            up to your elbows   
                in cow flesh?   

494
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,200
Sid, I never knew               
you felt this way.              

495
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
          Well, I didn't always.

496
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,700
              But, I don't know,
         this is the '90s, Norm.

497
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,400
             We've learned a lot
    about the kind of poisons   

498
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,200
              we've been putting
                into our bodies.

499
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,500
     Now, you look at that.     

500
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
      You see some T-bones      
    and a rump roast.           

501
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,800
      I see a loaded gun.       

502
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,200
    I've been carrying it around
  with me for a long time, Norm,

503
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,400
the guilt for what I've been    
doing to bodies like yours.     

504
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,500
I thought I had a way out.      

505
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
I could sell the place to the,  
to the lube syndicate.          

506
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,600
But... I guess the only         
way out for me now              

507
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,500
is just to torch the place.     

508
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
    Hey, no, no, you can't...   

509
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,500
    Sid, you cannot burn down   
              the Hungry Heifer.

510
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah. I guess                   
you're right.                   

511
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,500
                 Yeah.          

512
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,100
I'd be the first one            
they'd suspect.                 

513
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
But who am I gonna get          
to do it for me, Norm?          

514
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,800
I've got no family.             

515
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,500
Who's gonna light               
the match for me.               

516
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
I've got no son.                

517
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,400
You're the one who came         
closest to that for me.         

518
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,100
            Thank you, Sid.     

519
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Light the match.                

520
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
          No, no. There's no way

521
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,300
            I'm gonna let you go
          through with this. No.

522
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm an old man, Norm.           

523
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,100
I've got nothing                
to look forward to.             

524
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,800
Light the match.                

525
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,100
            Look, there's no way
            I'm gonna let you go
              through with this.

526
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,000
          Hey, you mean too much
            to me, all right?   

527
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,900
            I mean... look, I   
              never said this...

528
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,600
            to my own father,   

529
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,200
    but I... I love you, Sid.   

530
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:34,100
Hey, I didn't know              
you felt like that, Norm.       
                Yeah.           

531
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Gee, I love you, too.           

532
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
              Thank you, Sid.   

533
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,600
Light the match.                

534
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,200
             Would you stop with
            the matches, Sid?   

535
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
              Just stop with it.

536
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,300
        So, Sid finally         
    came around, huh?           

537
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
  Yeah. You bet he did. Yeah.   
WOODY:                          
How'd you convince him?         

538
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Well, I told him he could serve 
    a healthier menu,           

539
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,900
        uh, smaller portions,   

540
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
      leaner cuts of beef.      

541
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,700
  He's actually gonna put some  
    greens in the salad bar.    

542
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,400
                  Oh.           
            You know we could   
                 change the name

543
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,700
     to the Healthy Heifer.     

544
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,100
                        Yeah.   

545
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,700
        I think I really turned 
         his life around today. 

546
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,100
    What the hell...?           

547
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,300
                Sid... Sid!     

548
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,800
            What's going on?    

549
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,300
    This is Gus, the busboy.    

550
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,300
 Now <i>he's</i> the son I never had.  

551
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
                Fire!           

552
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
    Fire!                       

553
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:25,525
