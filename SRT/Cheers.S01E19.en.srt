1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,436
You're in a pretty good mood tonight.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,118
Why not?

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,516
l was up till two in the morning
finishing off Kierkegaard.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,710
l hope he thanked you for it.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,271
l see Coach and George
are still at it.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,756
Yeah. lt's kind of fun.
They enjoy each other's company.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,950
lt's nice to have someone
your own age to spend time with.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,314
You've been through the same fads.
You don't have to explain things.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,592
- There's a real comfort in that.
- Too bad we're not closer in age.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,590
lsn't it?

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,359
However, six or seven years
really isn't that much.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,040
l would have thought eight or nine.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,631
- l find older men stimulating.
- l hope you're not talking about me.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,469
Certainly not. You're not
in the least bit stimulating.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,959
Listen. Seriously,
l would not worry about your age.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,551
You're obviously young enough to
bring that Kierkegaard fellow home.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,478
Do you two think that
you could put your glands on hold

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,751
long enough
to get some work done here?

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,236
You win again, George.

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,319
l just had all the cards today,
Coach. You'll get me tomorrow.

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,715
You bet l will. Take it easy, pal.

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,515
Always do. See you, pal.
See you, folks.

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,675
- Take care.
- Bye.

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,156
Sam, can l borrow
20 bucks till payday?

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,396
You bet.

26
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,035
- Boy, was that George hot!
- l didn't know you played for money.

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
Every day for months.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,309
- How many games have you won?
- lf l had to guess, let me see...

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,639
None.

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,910
None?

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,350
Sam,
l've been right in there every game.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,758
- Coach, that guy's a hustler.
- George and me, we're like pals.

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,155
That's how they operate. Trust me.

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,909
- We're only playing for fun.
- How much fun have you lost?

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,112
- About eight grand.
- Eight grand?

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,634
That's spread over
since last February.

37
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,198
Don't you see what he's doing? He's
taking you for everything you got.

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,878
l can't believe it.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,276
Sam, you are at least six or seven
years older than l am. Admit it.

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,719
Wait a second.

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,879
We just discovered George has been
hustling Coach for a lot of money.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,913
George? That sweet,
white-haired gentleman?

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,191
- Piffle.
- No, Diane, it's true.

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,914
Sam, isn't there anything
we can do about it?

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,989
l got it. We beat him up, strip him,
take his money and put him on a bus.

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,236
- Subtle, Carla.
- That's how l got to Boston.

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,750
l just had the worst idea
l've ever had.

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,795
- Worse than hiring her?
- The second worst idea.

49
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,876
Remember Harry?

50
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,869
Maybe he could help us out here.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,879
You mean that hustler
you're always throwing out?

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,753
That's like calling Spinoza
to settle an argument

53
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,474
between Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.

54
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,876
She's got a point there, Sam.

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,478
Look, l think
it's a mistake to trust Harry.

56
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,116
George is a con men. Harry's
a con man. What's the old saying?

57
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,708
- ''Send a thief...''
- ''To camp for the summer.''

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,990
l don't even know where to find him.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,477
l know exactly where he is.
ln jail, like he always is.

60
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,556
You sure?

61
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,550
ln Boston, for the city jail.
Sure you don't mind me doing this?

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,514
No, go ahead. l use lnformation
to get numbers all the time.

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,798
Coach.

64
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,075
- Hi, Harry.
- Harry...

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,275
..Here's the 1 0 bucks l'm gonna owe
you in about five minutes.

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,395
Thanks. Coach, where's Sam?

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,239
- He'll be out in a minute.
- Wanna play for a drink?

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,112
Not a chance, Harry. No way.

69
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,716
Don't show fear.

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,236
He smells fear.

71
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,640
Cliff. You feel lucky?

72
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,598
- Sure. Why?
- Tell you what.

73
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,793
l'll bet you a dime l can drink
that drink without touching the hat.

74
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,670
A dime?

75
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,189
- OK. You're on.
- You'll love this.

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,796
lt's gone.

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,994
What's so good about that?
Anybody can do that. l can do that.

78
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,714
- No.
- A dime?

79
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,796
Coach, another shot, please.

80
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,351
A dime says l can drink the old shot
without touching the old <i>chapeau.</i>

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,435
Are you ready? l'll be right back.

82
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,876
OK, that baby's gone.

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,273
That's great, Cliff.
That's worth a dime.

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,880
You can laugh,
but at least l got my money back.

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,309
Five bucks for the booze, Cliffo.

86
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,957
- Thanks, Cliff.
- Any time, Harry.

87
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,672
What's the matter?

88
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,837
lf you gave as much to the
space programme as you have to him,

89
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,315
we'd have condos on Venus.

90
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,708
Thank you for coming.
Can l get you a drink?

91
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,877
- For free is too easy.
- Let's go sit down over there.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,719
Coach, you wanna join us?
Carla, you got the bar?

93
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,076
She always gets to watch the bar.

94
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,953
- Diane, you may have the bar.
- Goody.

95
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,350
Diane has the bar.

96
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,754
- Yes?
- l need a Bloody Mary.

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,235
A Bloody Mary coming up.

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,276
Where do we keep the Mary?

99
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,676
''The Bartender's Guide.''

100
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,548
''The Bloody Mary.''

101
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,309
''There's nothing like a fresh
Bloody Mary to start any day.''

102
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,238
''A traditional favourite
served with lunch, brunch,

103
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,033
and often as the
'hair of the dog that bit you'.''

104
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,789
- ''lts name derives from...''
- Make the drink!

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,835
That's Eddie the Mole from Phoenix.
They call him Mole Man, or Moley.

106
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,190
- ln Philly they call him Sid.
- Sid?

107
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,754
Philly's a dull town.

108
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,513
So, what you're saying
is he's pretty well-known?

109
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,313
Any bird-dogger knows him.
He runs paper and cubes,

110
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,954
mainly in the crib,
sometimes up against the wall.

111
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,275
Puts on a straight-up-guy front,

112
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,073
and then grinds away slow
with coolers and hop toads,

113
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,031
real rip and tear kind of stuff.

114
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,391
Yeah. That sounds like him.

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,990
lt seems to me he got in trouble
with the boys in Vegas last year.

116
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,953
He's been keeping a low profile.
Could be him.

117
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,516
A lot of those guys lay low
by making small money off dumb saps.

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,596
So where do l come in?

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,552
Sam, excuse me. Where do you keep
the measuring spoons?

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,913
- We don't have any.
- What?

121
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,919
''Precise measurements are one of
the keys to a good drink.'' Page 1 2.

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,635
Serving it the same day it's ordered
is right up there, too.

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,670
Carla,...

124
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,950
Girls, please.

125
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,033
C'mon, Harry.
You got anything? You got any ideas?

126
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,314
l think you need a poker game.
The Mole is not known for poker.

127
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,989
Call him and tell him you have
a little game going here at closing.

128
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,510
That makes you the roper.
You bring him into the game.

129
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,519
How do we know that he brings
enough money to cover Coach's losses?

130
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,076
The guys always carry a big roll.
They gotta be ready for action.

131
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,272
You have to promote this
as a friendly neighbourhood game.

132
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,391
- You're the inside man.
- With you so far.

133
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,830
- l'm gonna need a bankroll.
- You just lost me.

134
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,157
Sam, if you don't stake me,
it doesn't go down.

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,955
- l need about five grand.
- Five grand? Are you kidding me?

136
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,878
This whole thing's
getting out of hand.

137
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,990
Sam, please.

138
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,474
Alright. l'll be the... What d'you
call the guy who brings the money?

139
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,194
You call him the guy
who brings the money.

140
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,670
One other thing, Sam.

141
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,234
- l appreciate this.
- l appreciate getting bailed out.

142
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,913
Besides, l don't like the idea of
somebody else plucking my pigeons.

143
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,031
See ya.

144
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,116
Thanks, Sam.

145
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,796
''A dash of pepper.''

146
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,310
A lot of ingredients
in a Bloody Mary.

147
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,150
That's why we usually mix up five
gallons and put it in the fridge.

148
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,350
Carla, why'd you let her do it?

149
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,438
l wanted to see her
try and make vodka.

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,676
- Closing time.
- Sammy, let me get this straight.

151
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,916
Whatever we lose,
we're gonna get back.

152
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,235
- That's right.
- Great.

153
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,510
l love to gamble without risk.

154
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,551
Sam, would you mind
if l stay and watch?

155
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,956
l promise l won't ask
a bunch of dumb questions.

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,913
- You won't even know l'm here.
- OK.

157
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,396
So, why poker?

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,952
Why not crazy eights or chess? Why
don't l shut up like l said l would?

159
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,314
l always get this way when
l'm nervous. What can l do to stop?

160
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,194
l know what to do with hiccups,
but with runaway chattering...

161
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,876
Hello, everyone.

162
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,314
Hi, George.

163
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,796
l understand you fellas have
a little poker game going tonight?

164
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,036
We get together
every once in a while.

165
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,390
Coach thought
you might like to sit in.

166
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,038
l haven't played poker in years.
l just hope l don't embarrass myself.

167
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,072
Embarrass yourself?
You're playing poker with guys

168
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,953
who can't bet and chew gum
at the same time.

169
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,070
We got an extra chair in here, Harry,
if you wanna sit in.

170
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,838
Me?

171
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,272
Well, l've heard that poker
can be a pleasant diversion,

172
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,280
if it doesn't get too intense.

173
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,313
- Aren't you playing, Coach?
- Not me, George. Gin's my game.

174
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,279
OK. Minimum buy-in's $500.
Let's see some money, gentlemen.

175
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,516
You're pretty good.

176
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,792
- Lucky tonight.
- Yeah, real lucky, huh, Harry?

177
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,871
Your bet, Cliff.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,552
l'll see that 50
and l'll raise you...

179
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,275
Let's see. l'll raise you
1 00 Paul Revere commemoratives.

180
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,551
You can't bet stamps.

181
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,550
l'll fold, then.

182
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,639
- Up to you, Norm.
- The Lord hates a coward.

183
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,278
l'll see the 50 and raise $300.

184
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,233
- You're bluffing.
- You're right. l'm out.

185
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,117
l'll raise 500.

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,352
Too rich for my blood.

187
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,438
l'm calling you, George.

188
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,875
Looks like it's my night, boys.

189
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,154
Harry, maybe we ought to
get out of the game.

190
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,032
- What for?
- No reason.

191
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,230
You lost most of the money l put in,

192
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,557
George has got all the cards,
and you're playing lousy.

193
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,875
Everything's fine.
l'm toying with him.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,276
l'm giving him
a false sense of security.

195
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,960
You're giving him
a genuine sense of security.

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,196
Fellas, let's play cards.

197
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,435
Straight to the jack.

198
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,832
Damn.

199
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,670
- What the hell happened?
- l lost.

200
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,030
No kidding.
You lost everything l put in.

201
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,549
Why didn't you cheat?
That was the whole point.

202
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,595
l ran every gaff l know
and he beat me.

203
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,474
l don't know what to say to you
except l'm sorry.

204
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,670
l'm going to wash up.

205
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,315
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's been a pleasure.

206
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,797
Sam, could l ask you a question?
Does four of a kind beat a straight?

207
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,989
Of course.

208
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,556
Then why did Harry throw in
these four threes?

209
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,514
- Look what time it's getting to be.
- George, hang on a second.

210
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,108
- What's going on here?
- l'm just going home.

211
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,196
Maybe not.

212
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,230
You and Harry concocted this
whole deal this afternoon, right?

213
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,749
Are you gonna go outside
and split the winnings?

214
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,915
Of course not.

215
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,271
Then you wouldn't mind
if we just take our money back.

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,675
Try anything and l'll tell the police
about this poker game.

217
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,758
You could lose your liquor licence.

218
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,836
You've done this before.

219
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,678
You made a fool out of me,
and you can keep my money.

220
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,872
l just want my friends to get
their money back, every penny.

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,638
You understand?

222
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,752
l'm not giving you
any of my money back, Coach.

223
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,319
- What if we cut up Harry's share?
- That's not such a bad idea.

224
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,399
You could play him again, beat him,
and give us our money back.

225
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,476
l never did like the guy.

226
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,438
- l'll challenge him to another game.
- You think you can beat him?

227
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,516
Of course l can.

228
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,031
l can have three queens
in my hand at any time.

229
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,115
All l need to know is
when he can't beat that.

230
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,310
You mean like a sign?

231
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,274
Please let me give the sign.
All this trouble's on account of me.

232
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,039
Please let me give the sign.

233
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,310
l don't know. lt's tricky, isn't it?

234
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,558
He is the last person Harry would
figure being in on anything clever.

235
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,828
Just don't screw it up.
Come here, Coach.

236
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,390
Give your sign the first time
Harry can't beat three queens.

237
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,193
- What's the sign?
- Let me see.

238
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,153
l'll rub my nose like this.
lt's the old bunt sign.

239
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,554
Got it.

240
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,437
OK, good night, everybody.

241
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,836
- George, you need a ride downtown?
- They're onto us, Harry.

242
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,635
- Onto what?
- They figured out our little prank.

243
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,672
Come on, Sam. Times are hard.
A guy's gotta do what he can.

244
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,713
Harry, l was never
much of a team player,

245
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,354
especially with Boston small-timers.

246
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,233
Why don't you and me play a little
one-on-one for the whole jackpot.

247
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,315
You know, Mole, l was never
too impressed by Arizona hustlers,

248
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,557
except they got good sinuses.

249
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,192
You're on.

250
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,153
- Mind if l deal?
- No.

251
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,909
- What's the game?
- Five-card draw, no limit.

252
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,395
- Here's your half.
- Fine.

253
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,909
- Ante's a yard.
- What?

254
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,190
$1 00. Pay attention.

255
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,715
l'll bet two.

256
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,429
lt's covered. What do you need?

257
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,959
One.

258
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,556
Dealer takes one.

259
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,360
George, did you see that?

260
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,074
Yes, l did, Coach.

261
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,033
l scratched my nose
because it was itchy.

262
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,635
- Right. l saw you do that.
- lt was really itchy, George.

263
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,638
- That's why you scratched it.
- Exactly.

264
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,594
Stimulating conversation.
We playing cards or what?

265
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,599
- lt's George's bet.
- Harry, let's stop fooling around.

266
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,075
l'm going into my private stash.

267
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,436
Ten grand.

268
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,916
l like those socks.

269
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,270
Covered.

270
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,356
Three little ladies.

271
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,029
- Four threes?
- That can't be.

272
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,390
Seeing is believing, Mole.

273
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,910
- Why did you make the bet?
- Because you scratched your nose.

274
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,838
But l told you
why l scratched my nose.

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,073
That does it. l never wanna see you
come through that door again.

276
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,191
Don't worry, Malone, you won't.

277
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,832
You caused me to lose a fortune,
you old fool.

278
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,988
You're a stupid, blundering moron
who deserves to lose his money.

279
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,630
What a night.

280
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,228
l don't believe
the whole thing happened.

281
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,316
l feel so used.

282
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,676
What are you doing?

283
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,236
Sammy, l think he's snapped.

284
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,952
He's laughing.

285
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,389
- What are you laughing at?
- That.

286
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,080
One born every minute.

287
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,714
We did it, Harry.

288
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,071
There's your money.
Who wants to play double or nothing?

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,912
You had George conned that
you two were working together

290
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,996
while it was you and Coach?

291
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,395
- You're not even close.
- Yeah, he is.

292
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,954
That's it exactly.

293
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,873
Come on, everybody, coffee's on me.

294
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,069
So only you and Coach
knew about this?

295
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,430
Why didn't you let us in on it?

296
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,030
l didn't think you were
bright enough to pull it off.

297
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,549
l still don't like you.

298
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,957
You feeling lucky tonight?

299
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,872
What you got in mind?

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,958
A game of chance,
simple cut of the cards.

301
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,474
What are the stakes?

302
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,152
lf l win,
l get to go to bed with you.

303
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,190
- What if l win?
- You get to go to bed with me.

304
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,112
Forget it.

305
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,357
l understand. You'd rather earn it.

306
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,635
