1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,473
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,072
Okay, guys, time's almost up.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,518
How do they expect you to form words
with all the letters mixed up like that?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,992
- That's the point of the game, Woody.
- Hey, Sam, where's Diane?

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,674
She's been burning the midnight oil,
studying for exams.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,831
I'm letting her catch a few winks
in the office.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,999
She couldn't catch winks if she walked
naked through a troop train.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,918
Say, I wonder if she's dreaming
about me.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,877
Fat chance.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,590
That's it, time's up.
What do you got? You first.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,758
I've got "reap," "pear" and "ear."

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,638
Well, I'm sorry, Woody. I got those
too, so it cancels yours out.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,554
But I've also got "flork," "ferd"
and "snot."

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,036
Come on, man, there's no such
word as "flork."

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,078
What are you talking about? You know
those little flags on the mailboxes?

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,196
What do you think holds them on?

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,229
Gee, Mr Clavin, you're so smart
I don't even know why

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,231
I bother playing with you.
You always win.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,590
You know what I say, Woody?
You just gotta be tenacious,

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,830
just like the great horned "muren."

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,719
Hey, well, besides, you almost
beat me in the last game.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,072
Yeah, just missed by a cat's "pleck."

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,191
Yep.

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,278
Boy, that's some storm
out there tonight, huh, Mr Clavin?

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,113
Well, to the layman perhaps, Woody.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,396
But in my profession we have
a saying:

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,558
"Neither rain nor sleet nor gloom
of night shall stay this courier from

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,792
the swift completion
of his appointed rounds."

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,871
Cliff, my car is stalled outside. How
about getting me your jumper cables?

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,190
What, and catch my death?

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,670
Hit the bricks.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,432
Appreciate it.

33
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,393
Sam, table six wants a bottle
of the house red.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,556
Woody, would you mind going
down to the wine cellar

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,950
- and getting some more, please?
- Of course not.

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,556
You know, I used to be afraid
of the dark, but I got myself over it.

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,988
Oh, yeah? How'd you do that?

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,670
Oh, well, I just shut my eyes
and pretended it wasn't there.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,517
Wine cellar?

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,877
Since when have we had a wine
cellar? Vodka rocks, please.

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,390
On your day off, I had a couple
of workers checking the plumbing,

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,028
and they discovered that there
was a staircase

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,713
behind the wall in the closet there.

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,553
That's amazing. You mean
it's just been there all this time?

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,599
Yeah. A long time ago, when this
was just a private house here,

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,309
the owners used to keep their crazy
old grandmother down there.

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,189
They say that if you're real quiet,
you can hear her chains rattle.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,916
Supposedly, she swore to seek
vengeance on blond waitresses.

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,196
Very funny.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,479
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,710
- Norman.
- Still pouring, Norm?

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,472
That's funny. I was about to ask you
the same thing.

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,432
Hey, some storm, huh?

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,996
Yeah. If I don't get home to Vera soon,
that road's gonna be closed.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,232
Say about another half hour or so
ought to do it.

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,357
Hey, Sam, where's the paper? I wanna
see what they say about the storm.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,630
Woody had it a minute ago.
Where is he anyway?

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,195
Better go check on him.

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,671
It's been a whole week since
I taught him how to climb stairs.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,868
- Oh, here it is. Wait a minute.
- I'll take that, Sammy.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,429
I told Vera I'd check
for double coupons.

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,552
Oh, Norman, that's very sweet.

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,070
Yeah, you know, Diane,
marriage is a full-time job.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,829
Oh, hey, Diane. Remember that
lunatic that tried to

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,713
strangle you while you were doing
that scene from Othello up there?

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,155
Oh, yeah, what was his name?
Andy Schroeder?

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,594
- There he is.
- What about him?

68
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,593
It says here that he escaped
from the state--

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,631
- Whoa, she does remember him.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,353
Anyway, it says here he could
be dangerous. I don't know.

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,715
Hey, hey, come on, Normie,
what's it say about the storm?

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,354
Sam, didn't you hear that?

73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,556
Andy-Andy, the man who tried
to kill me, is loose.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,558
Hey, calm down. No lunatic's
gonna go out on a night like this.

75
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,796
He'd have to be nuts.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,954
Boy, I hope my new wine cellar stays
dry. Where are those guys anyway?

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,151
- I'll go investigate for you, Sammy.
- Thank you.

78
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,954
Yeah, I've been anxious to check out
your salon de vin anyway.

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,792
Hey, look, if I'm any more
than five minutes,

80
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,474
send down some cheese
and crackers, huh?

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,512
Kind of a spooky night, huh?

82
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,751
Sam, how can you be so calm
knowing this man is free?

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,512
You've never taken him seriously.

84
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,114
Just because he smiles at you
with that pink-cheeked,

85
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,397
round kewpie doll face and says,
"Hi there," you think he's harmless.

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,269
Well, he's not. He's a cold-blooded
homicidal maniac.

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,594
Hey, no guy is gonna walk in here
into this brightly lit bar and attack you.

88
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,914
- Probably not in a dark one either.
- Oh, Sam!

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,753
What? Now, come on, everybody,
just relax here. I got candles now.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,911
That's right, everybody,
just keep calm, all right?

91
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,674
I mean, no reason to panic here.

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,389
Sammy, those taps operate
when the power is out, don't they?

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,519
Why haven't the others come up
from the wine cellar?

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,676
They sure have a knack
for picking the wrong time

95
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,718
- to goof off, don't they?
- All right, I'll go roust those guys out.

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,352
Or else I'll just have to bury
their bodies.

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,632
All right, that's it.
I'm calling the power company.

98
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,633
God, Sam, the phone is dead.

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,595
Oh, you're kidding. Wow, no phone,
no power. Cut off from the outside

100
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,070
world on a stormy night with
a homicidal maniac on the loose.

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,593
Isn't that always just the way?

102
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,313
God, that was Norman!

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,119
- What's happening?
- Oh, come on, whoa!

104
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,430
You are such a sucker.
Don't you see what's happening?

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,352
They know you found out
about Andy,

106
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,272
and they're just trying
to scare you to death.

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,398
Why don't you go down there
and just get it over with?

108
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,394
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

109
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,912
Oh, of course that's it.

110
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,636
Oh, I am such a goose.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,913
What should I expect
from this devilish crew?

112
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,992
Here I come. I'm opening the door.

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,230
Oh, I hope nobody's down here.

114
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,794
Because it sure would scare me if
people yelled out a bloodcurdling boo.

115
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,193
Well, looks like the candle is in
on your little joke too.

116
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,800
Why won't this light?

117
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,833
Hi there.

118
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,748
What? What?

119
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,154
Oh, God.

120
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,991
I just had the worst nightmare
of my entire life.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,356
By the way, Sam,
you were beastly to me.

122
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,758
Oh, really? Well, how was l?

123
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,196
You weren't in it.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,398
Of course.

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,831
Beastly? Can you be specific?

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,916
- All right.
- Sam, l--

127
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,550
I don't think Diane's dreams are
anything you should be meddling in.

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,190
Maybe you're right. Starring in them
is enough, I guess.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,151
You were having another one
of those dreams, weren't you?

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,074
Yes. But it wasn't as bad this time.

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,272
Diane, you've got to stop this
nonsense about Andy-Andy.

132
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,192
You've been dreaming
about him for months now,

133
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,954
since you found out he was released
from the state mental hospital.

134
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,033
Can you blame me?
The man tried to kill me, Frasier.

135
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,954
Look, Diane. Listen, I've--
I've talked with him.

136
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,589
You what?

137
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,631
Yes, as soon as you started
having those dreams,

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,030
I found out where Andy was living,
and I went to see him.

139
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,231
I wanted to learn if your fears
were unfounded, and,

140
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,628
believe me, they are, Diane.

141
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,432
I've counselled him
for several weeks now,

142
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,591
and his progress has been remarkable.

143
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,035
Frasier, I don't believe this.

144
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,636
I want you to confront this fear.

145
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,234
I mean, just talk to the man.

146
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,790
Never. Never, never, never!

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,077
Diane, I sense resistance.

148
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,237
Diane, I heard screams.

149
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,278
Oh, well, I dreamt
I was being murdered.

150
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,074
Was I the one
who was murdering you?

151
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,038
- No.
- Was I helping in any way?

152
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,715
Sam, I'm still a bit shaken up.
May I have the rest

153
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,438
- of the evening off, please?
- You bet.

154
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,669
Thank you.

155
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,393
She came in, she fell asleep,
and now she's going home.

156
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,954
Diane, what you need now is a little
TLC. Tender, loving Crane.

157
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,598
Well, thanks anyway.
I'm sure I'll be fine.

158
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,758
After that nightmare, maybe now
I can sleep through the night

159
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,549
without being haunted
by that homicidal cherub.

160
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,678
Listen, at least let me drive you home.
When you're this close to hysteria,

161
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,799
you need the calming influence
of a strong and mature man.

162
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,670
Hi there.

163
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,714
- Diane?
- Yes.

164
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,956
The reason I came here is to tell you

165
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,680
how deeply sorry I am that I hurt you.

166
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,917
And I also want you to know that
I'm leaving the country.

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,675
And it would mean so much to me
if I had your forgiveness.

168
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,594
Fine, you're forgiven. Now get out.

169
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,074
You can wish the man bon voyage
at least, for God's sake.

170
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,878
You're right.

171
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,074
Andy, I hope everything works out
for the best.

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,589
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes.

173
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,597
Well, then maybe you can help me.

174
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,392
I've fallen in love with a wonderful girl,
and we're going to get married.

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,997
And I'd like you to meet her.

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,031
- There's just one hitch.
- You killed her.

177
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,555
Hey, hey.

178
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,950
She-- She doesn't know about
my prison background.

179
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,550
So I've-- I've told her a few tiny fibs.

180
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,790
Like I have friends and a life.

181
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,039
And I've adopted you people to be it.

182
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,034
She's coming here to meet you all,
and I hope you'll back me up.

183
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,552
- l-- I don't know about this, Andrew.
- I disapprove.

184
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,757
Well, wait a second now. If I could just
throw in my two cents worth here,

185
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,593
I really couldn't give a damn
one way or the other.

186
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,713
Please, l-- All I'm asking is for what
society promised me.

187
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,309
A chance to start over.

188
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,911
Wait a second here. Frasier, Diane,

189
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,634
Iet me talk to you over here
for a minute, will you?

190
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,712
We'll be right back.
Hold on a sec. Come here.

191
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,798
Come on, let's sit down
over here. Listen.

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,911
Is Andy cured, or isn't he?

193
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,511
Well, Sam, a trained psychiatrist
never uses the term "cured."

194
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,432
Unless we're talking about ham.

195
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,872
That's pretty good.

196
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,590
No, to wax serious,

197
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,517
Andy's progress has been remarkable,
and, well, I'll-- I'll vouch for his stability.

198
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,999
Well, then I say let's help him.

199
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,476
I mean, we'll be giving both of them
a new chance on life there.

200
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,758
By George, Sam, sometimes
out of the mouths of babes.

201
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,390
No, let's not talk women now.
What do you say, huh?

202
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,992
I'm not so sure about this.

203
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,473
Well, Diane, instead of dwelling on
the bad person that Andy used to be,

204
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,752
we reinforce the good person
he wants to be.

205
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,230
Oh, come on, loosen up, will you?

206
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,075
It might even be fun if you'd unclench
your keister long enough.

207
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,598
That was pretty good.

208
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,634
Hey, come on. Andy?
Andy, we're with you.

209
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,114
I really appreciate it.

210
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,195
Listen, before she gets here, let me
coach you on the little lies I told her.

211
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,992
My God, she's early.

212
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,549
What am I gonna do?

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,190
Please, everybody,
whatever I say, just go along.

214
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,918
- Trust me.
- All right.

215
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,470
- Andy.
- Cynthia.

216
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,350
- Everybody, this is Cynthia.
- Hello, Cynthia.

217
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,595
- Hi.
- Hi, Cynthia.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,073
I've heard so much about you all.

219
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,189
Andy, I really love your bar.

220
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,915
Andy's bar?

221
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,554
Oh, you must be Sam.

222
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,513
Yes, that's right, I'm Sam.

223
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,078
I'm really glad to see you putting
your life back together again.

224
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,959
Well, I'm-- I'm trying.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,593
Well, I really admire Andy's philosophy
on giving ex-cons a second chance.

226
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,034
Even a flasher.

227
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,153
Well, you know what they say,
if you've got it, why not--?

228
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,799
Sam.

229
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,588
You must be Diane.

230
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,116
- lndeed I am.
- Poor, poor Diane.

231
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,118
Yes. Well...

232
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,596
No, really, it's all right. It's all right,
he's told me everything.

233
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,478
What did he tell you?

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,992
How you so wanted to have his child.

235
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,269
And this, of course, is Frasier Crane.

236
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,917
Oh, the poor wretch
you've been counselling.

237
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,240
Yes, he's helped me quite a bit.

238
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,879
I hope so. Are you still having trouble
with that little habit?

239
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,874
Habit?

240
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,629
- What little habit is that, Fras?
- Yeah, Frasier.

241
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,031
Do tell, do tell.

242
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,708
It's an illness. He's not ashamed of it.

243
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,757
- Are you, Frasier?
- Oh, certainly not.

244
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,879
Not exactly. Well, not entirely.

245
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,793
- It all depends on the--
- He's a kleptomaniac.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,389
And not making
much progress, I'm afraid.

247
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,118
He shoplifted his entire wardrobe.

248
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,195
Well, not all of it, but these pants
are pretty hot.

249
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,033
Sam, are we having a good night?

250
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,760
- How much have I got in the register?
- Oh, I don't know.

251
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,275
It's been pretty slow. Probably no more
than about 50 bucks.

252
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,432
Are you kidding?
We must have 1,000 in here.

253
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,512
- Thank you, Woody.
- I just thought the owner should know.

254
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,199
I'll need the cash for my trip.

255
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,910
- Oh, Andy, I don't know about that.
- Oh, Sam, loosen up.

256
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,992
Unclench your cash register.

257
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,995
Listen, Andy, how about tearing up
all my unpaid bar chits

258
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,594
- as kind of a little going-away present?
- Norm, you're a good

259
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,716
and valued customer,
but I can't do that.

260
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,594
- Nice try there, Norm.
- Do it yourself, big guy.

261
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,951
- All right. Hey.
- Hey, that's great, Andy.

262
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,396
- Hey, how about me, pal?
- Not a chance.

263
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,552
Well, it looks like you did a little better
than I thought you did there, Andy.

264
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,070
Let's see here. One hundred, 200--

265
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,198
Oh, don't bother counting it, Sam.
I'll just take it all.

266
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,949
Say, look at the time.
We have to fly.

267
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,279
Diane, baby, for old time's sake.

268
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,591
The man just gives and gives
and gives.

269
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,392
Sam, take care of my bar
and take care of this little gal of mine.

270
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,032
It was nice meeting you all.

271
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,637
Oh, us too. And by the way,
I love your choker.

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,558
I'm not wearing a choker.

273
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,917
- You will be.
- Come along there. Bye.

274
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,072
Sam.

275
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,949
You have to stop Andy.
He's taking all your money.

276
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,712
He'll be back. Just give him a chance.

277
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,431
Are you crazy? He's never
coming back. I'm calling the police.

278
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,791
Oh, come on, l--
He's coming back, Diane.

279
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,713
You know, I've made jokes about
your dearth of living brain cells,

280
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,112
but it's not funny anymore.
Don't you get tired of being wrong?

281
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,078
- Thank you, everybody.
- Hold it a second, Andy,

282
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,832
Diane's making a fool of herself here.

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,436
Sam, you guys made me look like
a big shot in Cynthia's eyes.

284
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,278
You guys were wonderful.

285
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,829
- I'll never forget you.
- Well...

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,072
I'm most touched that you
trusted me, Diane. You,

287
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,997
who had reason to fear
and to hate me the most.

288
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,433
- Sam.
- Oh, yeah.

289
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,272
Goodbye.

290
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,395
Sam, I'm sorry, l-- Sam, wait.

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,070
How could I have been so wrong?

292
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,800
A lifetime of practice.

293
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,791
Sam?

294
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,999
Sam, I'm sorry. I feel awful.

295
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,391
You were right.
Please accept my apology.

296
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,233
Oh, forget it, Diane. I forgive you.

297
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,072
The quality of mercy is not strained.

298
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,958
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven

299
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,634
upon the place beneath.
It is twice blest.

300
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,395
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

301
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,956
Thank you, Sam. What did you say?

302
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,476
I think you heard me.

303
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,189
Yes, but you said it.

304
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,633
Well, perhaps in his pithy way,
Blake said it best.

305
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,392
Oh, yes.

306
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,391
And throughout eternity
I forgive you, and you forgive me.

307
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,599
- I can't believe my ears.
- Oh, come on, Diane.

308
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,718
You really didn't believe that buffoonish
façade that I've been perpetrating

309
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,190
for the benefit
of my blue-collar clientele, did you?

310
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,993
Oh, my God.

311
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,480
My heart is racing, Sam.

312
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,390
Oh, dear. Well, I know just the thing.

313
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,311
Perhaps a spot of chamomile tea
would calm you down.

314
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,789
There you go. Please.

315
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,837
- Careful.
- Sam, I never found you so attractive.

316
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,114
Oh, well, how nice.
Listen, before we take this any further,

317
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,756
would you mind sitting down?
I'd love to play you a little something

318
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,388
from an opera that I've been writing.

319
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,597
It's-- It's based on the Old Testament.

320
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,274
It combines the brooding
intensity of Mahler

321
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,195
with the pesky insouciance of Poulenc,
and it goes something like this.

322
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,791
Sam?

323
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,234
Sam?

324
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,632
Take me. Now. I want you.

325
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,956
Put the keyboard away,

326
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,432
and let me be the instrument
you play on.

327
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,870
- Diane?
- Yes.

328
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,993
Do you realize you just ended
that proposition with a preposition?

329
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,996
Just have me.

330
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,991
Have me.

331
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,071
Oh, Diane.

332
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,673
Diane.

333
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,435
Diane, Diane? Hey.

334
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,596
Sam.

335
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,633
This may be a silly question,

336
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,679
but you don't have a velvet
smoking jacket, do you?

337
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,435
Hey, come on, I'm smoking
in any jacket.

338
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,271
- What is this? What's going on?
- But of course.

339
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,389
I just had the weirdest dream.

340
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,512
I thought I was waking up from
a dream, but I was in another dream.

341
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,592
Andy-Andy came back.
Oh, it was terrible.

342
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,351
And there was a wine cellar here.
And we all went into it.

343
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,472
And Frasier was a kleptomaniac,
and you were smart.

344
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,830
When did it get weird?

345
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,788
Hey, Sam? You wanna come
continue this word game?

346
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,916
Woody's on the brink
of forming a syllable.

347
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,277
Oh, yeah. Whoa, wait a second.

348
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,238
You never told me how that
dream ended. Did you and l...?

349
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,158
Certainly not.

350
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,990
Oh, well, that really was
a bad dream, wasn't it?
