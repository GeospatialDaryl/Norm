 to calm my nerves, all right?

any stupid remarks              

76

      or kissing ashtrays,

the phrase "coffin nails,"      

78

you better be a mortician.

      has calmed her down.

            builder did, too.   

125
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:54,141
     Let me, huh, put these     
    beers on ice here.          

126
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,376
        Yeah, good idea.        

127
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,578
    It's not too cold           
        in here, buddy.         

128
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:59,213
        Oh, yeah, yeah,         
    I noticed that, Normie.     

129
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:01,582
    I think it's the,           
     uh, amalgamator valve.     

130
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,067

            to strip it down,

132
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,837

                put, uh,        

133
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,472
             some more Freon in 
             the regulator, too.

        you want to take

        the pool on your way in?

      summer rolls around,      

141
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,155
      and all those girls       
         are out there

         a pair of binoculars?

      coming by, you guys,

149
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:39,553
                I got to ask you
                 to skedaddle.

Yeah, maybe we                  
could stick around              

167
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:19,477
and meet your

    that's a very good idea.

 Well, why don't you bring her  
    by the bar or something?

00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:27,785
                Well, you know, 
                I've been trying

172
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,286
            to get the woman    
              to go out, Normie,

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,888

              wants to stay, uh,

              I guess I'm her...

I definitely don't care to see.

down at the bar,

     at a no-smoking clinic

        people coughing.        

230

    And the worst one           
  was a cigarette snuffed out

 from wanting a cigarette, eh?

No, Carla, you mustn't!         

241

Carla, now, granted,

00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:43,980
she's been in rather            
a foul mood lately,             

243

a serious life decision,        

244
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,252
and what she needs now          
more than anything else         

245
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:49,953
is encouragement                
and support,                    

246
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,788

am not going to fail her.

    Woody,                      

360
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,164
where exactly                   
was this farm?                  

361
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:50,104
              A couple of beers,
              there, Wood man.  

362
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:52,473
You got something               
on her, don't you?              

363
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:56,643
      You found something       
incriminating in her mail.      

364
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:59,112
    For God's sake, Cliff,      
    just ask her for money.     

365
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,582
    Don't be vicious.           

366
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:04,050
    Look, look, look,           
 is it so hard for you people,  

367
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,819
  and whatever you are, Carla,  

368
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,488
                to believe that,
                uh, this, uh,   

369
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,858
  beautiful woman would go out  
with me on her own accord?      

370
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:11,959
No, of course not,              
Cliff.                          

371
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:13,594
I can think                     
of any number of reasons        

372
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,295
why a woman                     
might behave that way.          

373
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:16,563
                    You can?    

374
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:18,215
Well, of course,                
but remember...

00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:19,749
I'm a psychiatrist.

So, hey, w-where's Sammy?       

377
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:26,257
I wanna show him                
one gorgeous Bostonian          

378

through his net.

about that over there...        

400
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,150
            No, I'm sorry. I    
            want to apologize

to worry about that, Sammy.

475
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:03,473
        Ah, wrong room.         

476
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,414
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

477
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:13,416
I knew it! I knew it!           
I knew it!                      

478
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,418
I'm not going to say I knew it, 
but I knew it.                  

479
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:16,919
I knew it.                      

480
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,422
 Now, this was your idea, too.  
 I did not come up with this.   

481
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:20,707
This is your idea.              

482
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,909
     What a great idea! Oh!     

483
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:25,261
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

484
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,097
     Well, what do you say?     

485
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:29,599
  Uh, shall we, uh, strip down  
    to our smiles here          

486
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:33,436
      and show the, uh...       
show the couch here a good time?

487
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,906
                        No.     

488
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,590
     We'll go to my place.      

489
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,926
    Excuse me?                  

490
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:43,263
Ooh! You're really going to go  
through with this, aren't you?  

491
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,749
        Yes, I am, but I want to
        get one thing straight. 

492
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:46,483
        Ooh, yeah, yeah.        

493
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,102
                  My smoking has
                  nothing to do 

494
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:50,604
        with sexual frustration 
        over you or anyone else.

495
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,606
                It's just a     
                stupid habit.   

496
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,608
              But I made a pact,

497
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,710
         so now I'm going to    
         suffer the consequences

498
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,612
              no matter how vile

499
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:01,381
                or disgusting   
                they may be.    

500
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,817
                    Let's go.   

501
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:05,452
            Well...             

502
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:09,339
     You don't really want      
      to do this, do you?       

503
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:11,741
      No, it's all right.       

504
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:14,944
    I'll just close my eyes     
 and imagine someone appealing. 

505
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:19,666
Besides, I have a feeling       
      it won't take long.       

506
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:24,021
 You know, gee whiz, you know,  

507
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:26,256
     if-if you're not going     
 to get in the spirit of this,  

508
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,025
    then I-I just don't want    
        to do it.               

509
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,626
     No, come on, come on,      
        a deal's a deal.        

510
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:31,811
              No.               

511
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:33,146
      Look, I made a pact.      
I just want to get it over with.

512
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:34,647
No, I don't want to do it.      

513
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:38,118
  You know, I have some pride.  
      I have some dignity.      

514
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:38,902
             I'll tell you what.

515
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:41,254
          You find someone else 
          to do your dirty work.

516
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,158
      Thinks she can mess       
        with Sam Malone.        

517
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:45,425
                  What happened?

518
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,595
She asked me to go to bed       
with her, and I said no.        

519
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,996
    Oh!                         

520
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,951
Oh, Cliff,                      
I have never driven             

521
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:57,120
so fast in my whole life.       

522
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:59,122
I had the best time.            

523
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:00,790
            Eh, great, great.   

524
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,559
                    So did I.   

525
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,494
Cliff, is something             
the matter?                     

526
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,546
 No, uh, nothing's the matter.  

527
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,747
What could be the matter?       

528
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,566
I'll tell you what's the matter,
Little Miss Porsche.            

529
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,902
Try to do a girl a favor,       

530
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,904
        help her become         
 a little bit more attractive,  

531
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,072
    and next thing you know,    
    she's out there...          

532
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:17,607
    attracting people.          

533
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:20,576
                  Is that what's
                  bothering you?

534
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,078
                    This makeup?

535
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,147
                Is that what all
                this is about?  

536
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:27,083
 Well, yeah, you got to admit,  
     before you put it on,      

537
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:29,920
         you were a...          

538
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:32,255
                a sweet thing   
                who, uh...      

539
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,090
              was content to sit

540
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,360
              by a dear friend's
              side on an evening

541
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:37,577
            and watch a rousing,

542
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:39,913
                  wholesome game
                  of <i>Jeopardy.</i>  

543
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:41,181
    So...                       

544
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:44,417
    all I have to do to make    
 things right between us is...  

545
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:46,586
 take off all this silly makeup 

546
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,455
      and go back to being      
         the way I was?         

547
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:53,026
            Wow, you... you'd   
            do that for me?     

548
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,627
            No way.             

549
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:59,066
I like the way I look in makeup.

550
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,236
Wait till they get a load of me 
at the Yarn Barn.               

551
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:06,807
            It makes you look   

552
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:10,143
        like a... cover girl.   

553
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:11,144
        ( <i>laughs</i> )              

554
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,513
    I'm sorry, Cliff.           

555
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:17,083
 That's what you're stuck with. 

556
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:21,605
You're just going to have       
to learn to live with it.       

557
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,408
      Well, I guess I'm...      

558
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,078
     big enough of a person     
not to let your appearance      

559
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,913
         get in the way         
      of our relationship.      

560
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,565
    I'm glad.                   

561
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,402
Besides, appearances            
don't matter at all.            

562
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,737
        Of course they don't.   

563
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,739
Like, it doesn't                
bother me                       

564
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:42,742
that you wear                   
those funny white socks.        

565
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,145
        Of course it doesn't.   

566
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,914
Or that it looks                
as if you trim                  

567
00:23:46,948 --> 00:23:48,916
your mustache                   
with a butter knife.            

568
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,583
                Eh, another     
                fine example.   

569
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:53,420
Cliff, have you ever considered 
joining a gym?                  

570
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:56,790
         Oh, you ever considered
         wearing flats?         

571
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:58,758
                  I can help you

572
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:00,961
              with that smoking 
              problem, you know.
