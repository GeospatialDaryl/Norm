1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,671
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,036
I'm sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,909
Oh, hey, I bet you can't guess
who I met at Janet's house last night.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,911
- Sam, please.
- What?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,712
This is really getting out of hand.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,792
In the month that you've been dating
the lovely Councillor Eldridge

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,076
you've done nothing
but drop names.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,271
You'd think you'd never seen
a celebrity before.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,273
So spare me your stargazing.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,193
Hey, hey, Gary Hart.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,669
- Gary Hart, there he is.
- Oh, hey, senator.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,115
Hi, Sam, you left your coat
in my car last night.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,833
That's sweet of you to bring it by.
Thank you.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,076
Least I could do
for a Trivial Pursuit partner.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,515
By the way, thanks for your help
with those sports questions.

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,551
Well, that's my strong point.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,517
Thank you for helping me
with everything else.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,314
- That's my strong point.
- Yeah.

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,751
Gary.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,793
What say you park her down here,
and I'll buy you a brewski, eh?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,513
Thanks. I think I'll take a rain check.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,870
Oh, well, in that case
you can buy me one.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,880
Just kidding, you know. Sort of.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,119
- Sam, I better run. Thanks.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,272
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you. Thanks for dropping by.

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,631
Oh, my God, it's Gary Hart.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,638
Did you see Gary Hart?
I saw Gary Hart. Senator Gary Hart.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,792
Could have been President Gary Hart.
Could still be President Gary Hart.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,639
Gary Hart, that's Gary...

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,757
I was just showing you
how silly it looks.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,554
Please, don't do it again.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,350
Frasier, it was awfully nice of you
to invite me out for a drink.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,834
Oh, well, it's my pleasure, Jim.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,991
I just couldn't bear
to see you so down in the dumps

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,594
after you lost the election.
I thought this might cheer you up.

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,076
I'm sure it will.

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,358
Woody...

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,951
...Iet me get a Scotch on the rocks.

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,430
- Oh, well, make that two.
- Coming right up.

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,793
Say, aren't you that guy that
Janet Eldridge whipped in the election?

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,317
- Woody.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,391
I guess you just look like him.

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,679
Did that Fleener guy
take a shellacking or what?

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,232
All right.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,351
Jim, you have to look on
the bright side of this.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,839
Yeah.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,028
Well, for example, what were the
positive things about your campaign?

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,751
Well... Well, of course,
there was Diane.

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,876
Diane?

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,396
She was wonderful.
She was absolutely wonderful.

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,189
You know, a man could go far
with a woman like that at his side.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,514
In fact, now that the campaign is over,
I thought I might ask her out.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,191
Well, I think that's wonderfully
open-minded of you,

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,351
considering her operation.

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,359
What operation was that?

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,959
Well, she had a sex-change operation.
Surely you knew.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,911
Sex change?

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,597
No, l, l-- Diane?

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,631
Hi, Frasier.

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,475
- Jim, what are you doing here?
- Diane, Diane,

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,636
what a courageous person you are.

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,912
- What are you talking about?
- What a wonderful job they did.

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,399
I, l-- Of course, now that I know,
I can tell the difference.

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,952
Well, I think I'm gonna be going now.

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,749
Bye, Diane.

66
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,793
It's great to see old Jimbo again,
isn't it?

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,555
Frasier, have you been telling people
I had a sex-change operation again?

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,158
No. He guessed.

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,113
Why, thank you, gentlemen.

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,550
Well, you look nice too,
Miss Eldridge.

71
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,992
Sam, we didn't expect to see you
here today.

72
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,270
Well, Janet wanted me
to change my tie.

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
Why don't you sit here.
I think the black one's under the bar.

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,435
I just wore this
as a kind of gag anyway.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,073
Good one.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,710
Do you...?
Do you want a white wine?

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,831
- I'd love it.
- Fine. Woody, would you do that?

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,719
- And a club soda for myself.
- Sure, Sam.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,070
- Hello, Sam.
- Oh, hi.

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,800
- My, going formal again.
- Yeah.

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,270
You've logged a lot of hours
in the tuxedo lately.

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,471
Kind of getting used to
the old monkey suit.

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,632
You know, I never realized until now
just how appropriate that nickname is.

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,316
That's very funny.

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,068
My, aren't we a grumpy primate?

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,878
She's jealous you're going to a party
at the mayor's house, and she's not.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,550
As a matter of fact,
I have a wonderful evening planned.

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,314
My date Gregory and l
are going to the theatre

89
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,631
and then to a late-night supper
and dancing.

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,075
Boy, does that bring back memories.

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Oh, are you recalling
a similar evening, Woody?

92
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,474
No, I just remembered your date called
and cancelled.

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,796
He said that he had to go on duty
at the hospital,

94
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,439
and that he was really very sorry.

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,431
Oh, I'm sorry too, sweetheart.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,712
Well, it's okay. Really.

97
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,395
It's not like I went out and spent $31 2
on a new dress.

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,319
Then you'd really feel dumb.

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,748
- Evening, everybody.
- Hey, Norm!

100
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,158
What's going down, Mr Peterson?

101
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,555
My cheeks on this barstool.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,871
What's the problem there,
Norm?

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,315
Trouble, Cliffie, with a capital D.

104
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,717
Vera's younger sister, Donna,
is coming to visit.

105
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,230
She insists on prancing around
the house wearing next to nothing.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,511
She's always exercising in front of me
in skimpy little leotards and stuff.

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,518
She'll shower with the door half open,
right in front of me.

108
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,233
I see your problem here.

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,871
Sounds like you got a case
of the frustrated female over there.

110
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,950
I know just what to do.
We'll try a little Acu-Clavin on her.

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,474
- Let me go get the car.
- Thank you for changing, Sam.

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,438
I mean, it did say on the invitation,
black tie.

113
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,392
Leash optional.

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,754
Well, Diane.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,558
The election is long over and
you must be tremendously relieved.

116
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,075
- About what?
- Remember, you were so concerned

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,789
I was going to abandon Sam
after he'd served my political purposes.

118
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,349
Obviously you were wrong
about Sam and l.

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,510
- Wrong about Sam and me.
- That too.

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,597
Excuse me. Sam's waiting.

121
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,636
I'd love to belt you.

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,520
Welcome to the losers' club, baby.

123
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,870
Now that you've paid your dues,
here's your membership card.

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,234
Yeah, we're a pair, aren't we?

125
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,755
A couple of chumps that life
just kicked in the teeth,

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,798
and why am l
talking like Broderick Crawford?

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,629
Frasier, I know you think I'm jealous
of Janet and Sam's relationship,

128
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,233
but I'm not.

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,956
I just don't want to see him get hurt.
That's really all there is to it.

130
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,755
I think you're kidding yourself, Diane.

131
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,990
We both know the reason
you've been down in the dumps.

132
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,991
But believe me,
there's no need to be.

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,913
Sam is not really happy
with that woman.

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,517
Imagine the mental strain it must be
trying to use the right fork all the time.

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,113
Don't give up hope. I haven't.

136
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,549
You're a lovely man.

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,994
I'm sorry I hurt you.

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,271
I wish there was some way
I could make you forgive me.

139
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,355
Well, marry me. Bear my children.
Let me die in your arms.

140
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,276
I was thinking more along the lines
of making fudge.

141
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,311
Well, I like your fudge.

142
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,638
- Hey, Diane, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

143
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,910
I'm gonna shut off the light
and lock you in.

144
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,793
- Okay.
- Don't forget to cover the pool table.

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,758
- Okay.
- Make sure you pull your arms off

146
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,230
- and stuff them down your throat.
- Okay.

147
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,396
What did...?

148
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,511
I'm sorry, honey. Let me just check
and make sure Woody remembered.

149
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,989
Go ahead.
I know it's had you preoccupied.

150
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,555
You hardly slept a wink
during the mayor's entire speech.

151
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,109
Oh, darn it, Woody.
I knew he'd forget.

152
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,159
He forgot to leave the check
for the beer man.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,117
Or did I forget to tell him?

154
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,590
No, no, no,
he forgot to remind me to tell him.

155
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,758
- That's what it was.
- Did you have a good time tonight?

156
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,714
I had a great time.

157
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,472
- That was nice.
- Yeah, nice in a great sort of way.

158
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,433
By the way, wasn't it funny
running into one of your old girlfriends

159
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,750
- working for the caterer tonight?
- Was that weird?

160
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,593
- What are the odds on that?
- Pretty good, I'd say.

161
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,069
We run into your girlfriends
all over town.

162
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,268
I'd like to point out that we didn't
see one in the limo on the way home.

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,795
What's the longest relationship
you've ever had, Sam?

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,036
Oh, let's see. I went out with
one person there for a whole year.

165
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,159
- Mind if I ask who she was?
- No, not at all. Any time.

166
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,394
Oh, right, you're asking now.
Well, all right.

167
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,871
You're not gonna believe this.

168
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,794
Nobody did.
I mean, I even have trouble believing it.

169
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,838
It was Diane.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,399
Unbelievable, huh?

171
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,472
No, actually it explains
quite a few things.

172
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,993
Well, that's... That's Diane for you.
Unbelievable and explaining things.

173
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,917
But anyway, that's all over now.

174
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,717
Since things are over
between you and Diane,

175
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,919
- I wonder why she still works here.
- Why, she's gotta work someplace.

176
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,270
Does she owe you money
she's trying to work off?

177
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,589
No.

178
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,312
Would you lose customers
if she leaves?

179
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,559
No. As a matter of fact, I'd probably
get a few back if I did let her go.

180
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,310
Sam, nobody said anything
about letting her go,

181
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,358
but, as a matter of fact,
you might be doing her a favour.

182
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,318
Unless, of course, there are still
feelings left between you two

183
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,038
that I should know about.

184
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,397
Don't be silly. Of course not.

185
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,155
I'm glad to hear that.

186
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,669
You know how much I care for you.

187
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,230
What are we doing here?
Let's go home.

188
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,231
Listen, don't worry about that.

189
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,311
Diane is probably staying here

190
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,948
because she thinks
that I can't do without her.

191
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,874
- Sam?
- Yeah?

192
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,072
Do you really think
that talented, bright, lovely woman

193
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,515
belongs in a bar serving drinks?

194
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,118
I guess not.
I mean, no, of course not.

195
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,232
Maybe she just needs a friendly shove
out of the nest.

196
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,795
I hadn't thought about that before,
in that way.

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
The sooner you do it, the sooner
she'll be out of this dead-end job

198
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,916
and on to something
a lot more meaningful in her life.

199
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,756
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Oh, Sam, what am I doing?

200
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,195
I'm not being honest.

201
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,071
The truth is...

202
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,029
...I'm just not comfortable
with Diane working here.

203
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,478
I mean, you've had a past with her.
And I'm as insecure as anybody.

204
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,318
Are you saying that you think
I should fire her?

205
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,476
Sam, it's not my business.

206
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,315
And I'm not trying to interfere.
But if I were you,

207
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,233
I'd do it right away.

208
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,119
Tomorrow.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,912
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. Why not?

210
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,835
Yeah, why not? I mean, tomorrow
is as good as any time, I guess.

211
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,716
Hey, Carla?
Carla, is Diane here yet?

212
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,718
No, Diane is not here yet.

213
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,235
That is the third time
you've asked me that.

214
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,278
Why would you, or anyone
for that matter, want to see her?

215
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,789
Well... Just curious. No reason.

216
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,679
Well, when she gets here,
I'll make an announcement, okay?

217
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,030
What's your problem?

218
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,599
Carla...

219
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,234
...has it ever occurred to you
that Diane doesn't really belong here?

220
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,749
You mean this bar or this planet?

221
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,752
Either way, it's yes.

222
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,395
Sometimes I think this place
just isn't good enough

223
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,152
for somebody like her, you know?

224
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,393
I mean, she's a cocktail waitress.
That's a dead-end job.

225
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,636
There's no future, no reward.

226
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,435
She, she's-- She's a junior
cocktail waitress.

227
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,070
You are a senior cocktail waitress.
There's a big difference.

228
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,510
Listen, Sam,
I know what this is all about.

229
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,398
You're not really that serious
about this Eldridge babe, are you?

230
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,359
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how serious I am.

231
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,717
But I do know that I'm having
the best time of my life.

232
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,158
And as you know,
my life has been wall-to-wall fun.

233
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,349
She's smart, but at the same time
she doesn't make me feel not smart.

234
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,596
I feel important when I'm around her.
I like that.

235
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,591
- Oh, puke.
- What?

236
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,874
Will you cut it out? I mean, that is
the sappiest junk I've ever heard.

237
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,555
Look, you've proven your point. You
can go out with classy dames like her.

238
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,756
You can go out with anybody.

239
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,353
Now, you've had your fun.

240
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,557
I want you to just quit fooling around,
march right out there,

241
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,837
and find yourself
an airhead with big casabas.

242
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,271
What the heck
has gotten into you, Carla?

243
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,836
Sammy, it's just not right.
You are not a one-woman guy.

244
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,953
I mean, it's like the time
of your great sickness.

245
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,353
- When I went out with Diane.
- That's right.

246
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,399
You're starting to get me worried.

247
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,949
No, no, no, you're nuts.
You're nuts, Carla.

248
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,830
When Diane gets here,
say something.

249
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,471
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,195
Hey, Mr Peterson.
Can I pour you a beer?

251
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,392
Well, okay, Woody,
but be sure to stop me at one.

252
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,875
Make that 1 :30.

253
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,636
So, Normie,
did Vera's sister, Donna, show?

254
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,759
Yeah, she showed all right, Cliff.
She showed plenty.

255
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,352
Well, don't tell me she's still
prancing around in her Skivvies, eh.

256
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,592
All right, listen to this.

257
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,837
I have to go to the room
to get something, right? So I knock.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,434
Once, twice, no answer.

259
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,874
So in I go, right?

260
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,320
There she is, sitting on the bed,
doing her nails, buck-naked.

261
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,911
Buck?

262
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,032
Totally buck.

263
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,395
She tried to cover herself up,
but believe me,

264
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,676
an emery board doesn't hide much.

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,398
My nerves are just frazzled.
I don't know what I should do, Cliffie.

266
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,438
Well, I've got you covered here,
Normie. You need to relax.

267
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,875
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Relax.

268
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,758
- Right.
- Yeah, see, why don't you and l

269
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,593
go over to your house
and watch some tube, eh?

270
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,670
Cheers. Oh, just a minute.

271
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,350
It's for you, Mr Peterson.

272
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,752
Oh, hey, Miss Chambers.

273
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,031
Hello, Woody.

274
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,670
- Where's Sam?
- He's in his office.

275
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,149
- He's dying to see you.
- Do you have an envelope

276
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,958
behind the bar, Woody?

277
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,758
Oh, Normie, you're as white
as a sheet. What's cooking?

278
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,751
Oh, that was Vera.
Her aunt's taken sick.

279
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,195
She has to go to Springfield
for a few days.

280
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,039
That leaves me at home alone
with Donna.

281
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,397
Just you and the siren.

282
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,718
Hey, Mr Peterson,
maybe you can use that siren thing

283
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,677
to scare off your sister-in-law.

284
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,430
- Hi, Diane.
- Hello, Frasier.

285
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,989
Oh, say, what--?
What's the matter with you?

286
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,796
Sam thinks he's going to fire me.

287
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,996
But I have a little surprise for him.

288
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,310
- I'm resigning.
- You're leaving Cheers?

289
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,953
- That's right.
- Well, great.

290
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,957
You can work for me.
I need a new receptionist.

291
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,198
Frasier, you have
a wonderful receptionist.

292
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,432
Mrs McGrady has worked for you
and your family for 20 years.

293
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,996
Well, yes, but I caught her in a typo
the other day, so she's history.

294
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,549
- Thank you, Frasier. I don't think so.
- Okay, but one word from you

295
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,711
and that blue-haired head rolls.

296
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,839
Is she here yet? Oh, good, good.

297
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,718
You're just the person I wanna see.

298
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,759
Sweetheart, you are far too bright,
talented and lovely to waste your--

299
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,957
Before you go any further, read this.

300
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,551
All right.

301
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,275
Well, does this--?
Does this mean you're quitting?

302
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,075
Isn't that what it clearly states
on page five?

303
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,799
But why?
I mean, I don't understand why.

304
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,959
My reasons are enumerated here
above the graph.

305
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,548
Oh. Oh, well, this--
This is great.

306
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,352
I mean, it's not great. It's awful.

307
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,478
But I mean it's, well, it's great for you.
Don't you think?

308
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,915
I mean, it's probably
best for everybody in the long run.

309
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,991
Personally, I feel awful about this.

310
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,393
I know what you were going to do.

311
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,516
You were going to fire me.

312
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,913
What makes you say that?

313
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,118
Let's just say a woman knows.

314
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,437
You were going to fire me.

315
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,473
And what have I done?
I've made it easier for you.

316
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,798
People have always made
things easier for you.

317
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,997
Well, I'm not going to let you
off the hook.

318
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,149
I withdraw my resignation.

319
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,313
Fire me, if you can.

320
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,038
But I don't think you have the guts.

321
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,834
After all we've gone through,
the good times and the bad,

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,515
I say you don't have the courage
to fire me to my face.

323
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,032
- You're fired.
- Too late. I resign.

324
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,872
No, you can't do that.

325
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,640
No, you took back your resignation
and you dared me to fire you.

326
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,190
No, you can't do that.
You're fired. I did it.

327
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,676
The last time we had
an official parting of the ways

328
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,434
there was some question
as to who left whom.

329
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,434
That is why this time I've gone to
the trouble of tendering my resignation

330
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,479
in the written form. Legal precedent
states that the written document

331
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,916
always supersedes
the spoken word,

332
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,678
especially when it's spoken
by a goof.

333
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,032
Oh, fine. Fine. Who cares?
See you in the funny papers.

334
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,352
Oh, that's perfect. The funny papers.

335
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,879
Don't say another word.

336
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,474
Let that be the last utterance
I remember.

337
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,359
And now I'm off to begin a new life.

338
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,910
- I shall forget you in a trice.
- Oh, a trice?

339
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,834
Please, let that be the last word
I hear from you.

340
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,638
You troglodyte.

341
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,394
That's even better!

342
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,071
Attention, everyone.
May I have your attention, please?

343
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,072
I have resigned.

344
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,152
I know this comes as a shock,
but I've decided

345
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,710
that I no longer fit into
the scheme of things around here.

346
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,994
I go willingly with a gladful heart, for it
has been my pleasure to serve you,

347
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,473
and my privilege to know you,
lo, these many years.

348
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,914
I shall miss you all.

349
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,389
But weep no tears
for Diane Chambers.

350
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,912
She's tougher than you think.

351
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,119
She's going to be okay.
You bet she is.

352
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,158
So this is goodbye.

353
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,632
For there's one thing I know:
You will never, ever see me again.

354
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,277
Farewell.

355
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,192
Hey, look, everyone. It's Diane.
