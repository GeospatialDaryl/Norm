         No, you idiot.

Oh, great.

                    No, no, it's

                 It's not, uh...
                 not that bad.  

250
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,300
                I paid big bucks
                to have Vera's

251
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000

I better take off.

Yeah. Yeah, I actually do,      
        you know?               

271
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
    I think painting is just    

272

      so vastly different       
        from accounting.

        I finish a job,

    I think that this color     
    is the exact same color     

281
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,300
 as Mary Lou Sebold's car coat.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,300
        This girl               
    I had an insane crush on    

284

      in the third grade.       

285
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,400
     Except she had no idea     
    that I was alive.           

286
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,900
I used to leave                 

287
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,000
     little notes for her.      

288
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
         "I love you."          

289
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,000
          And one day,          
I finally got up the nerve      

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
    to sign one, N.P.

    Nicky Petropolis.           

293
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,200
         What'd you do?         

294
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,100
         The only thing         
      I could do, really.       

295
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,400
     I went over to Nicky,      

296
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
     and I calmly explained     
         the situation.         

297
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
    Then I sat on him.

      I've really laughed

but, uh...                      

319
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
        Why? Who, uh...         
     who says you're cold?

    to tell you that,           

325

as though I could approach you.

                Thank you, Norm.

 for letting me paint an office

 You're kind of nice yourself.

  I guess we like each other.   

345
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
        Guess so.

            How so?             

352
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
              Well, it just     
              doesn't seem right

353
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,600
              when the stakes   
              for a game of pool

354
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
                 is a round of  
                 wine spritzers.

355
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,500
Not even the pool room is safe  

356
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,400
from the encroaching            
hordes of yuppiedom.            

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,200

until we're all suffocated

of alligator shirts,

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,600
German cars, and racquetball    
club memberships?               

360
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
Oh, oh, by the way, Sam,        

361
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,700
uh, may I have another          
Perrier with lime?              

362
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
            Have a cup of coffee
            or something, Sam?  

363
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
        Make it a beer.         
         On the house.

for pods from outer space.

     that's all about, huh?     

367
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,300
             Look, did it ever  
             occur to any of you

368
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
      that she just might       
        be a nice woman?        

369
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,800
                Oh, yeah, right.
