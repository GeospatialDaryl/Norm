          Yes, Carla?

13

    Yes, but you have           
      a warm personality.

 When you added up my paycheck, 

15
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:37,219

 a couple of fingers and toes.  

16

Oh, I'm afraid I had to dock you

            a total of two and  
            three quarters hours

18
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,456
                  for being late
                  last week.    

19
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,591
I had good excuses.

22
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:51,733
          Carla, Carla, here's a
          little time management
          trick that I use.     

23
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,134
            I set my watch ahead

24
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,369
                 a half an hour.

25
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,872
      That way, when I think I'm
      getting someplace on time,

26
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:58,106
                  I'm actually  
                  fooling myself

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,341
    into getting there early.   

28
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,310
Hey, you know, that makes       
good business sense, boss.      

29
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,579
I guess if I set my watch       
         an hour ahead,         

30
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:06,314
  it'd be twice as good, huh?   

31
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,281
                    Right.      

32
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,349
     Hey, what do you know?     

33
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:09,550
        It's lunch time.        

34
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:14,823

I've covered for you.

    start talking to myself?
