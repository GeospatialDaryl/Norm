1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,455
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,874
Sammy, got three questions.

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,377
One, who's going to fix the ball return

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,244
on the pool table?

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,463
Okay, I'll check that today.

6
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:15,665
Check. Two, how much vermouth
do you want next month?

7
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:17,467
Uh, an extra case.

8
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,219
Check. Three, why, why, why?!

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,470
Oh, come on, don't start with me

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,971
about the wedding, will you?

11
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,473
Oh, Sammy-- Sam,
it actually looks

12
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,842
like you're going to go through
with this horrible thing.

13
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:28,812
Why do you want to marry this woman?

14
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:33,483
I don't know, Carla. It...

15
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,238
It's not easy to explain.

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,023
I mean, why did you marry Nick?

17
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:42,409
Why?! 'Cause I was stupid, that's why.

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,328
Well...

19
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:47,280
actually, there was a little more.

20
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,283
What?

21
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,285
You tell anybody this,
and I'll kill you.

22
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,787
(muttering): No, I won't.

23
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,288
(sighing)

24
00:00:55,288 --> 00:01:00,794
Nick made me feel... all...

25
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,680
(sighing): all squooshy inside.

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,516
"Squooshy"?

27
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:08,384
Squooshy.

28
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,805
Uh, well...

29
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,807
that's how Diane
makes me feel--

30
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,808
all squooshy.

31
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,309
(yelling): Oh, yuck!

32
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,193
Double yuck!

33
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:18,695
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!

34
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,063
This is so disgusting!

35
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,364
You said it. What do y...?

36
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,366
I married Nick 'cause he knocked me up.

37
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:24,617
This is sickening!

38
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,401
Ugh!

39
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,403
I only said it 'cause you said it.

40
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,905
What are you do...? I need some air.

41
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,406
Hey, guys, listen to this!

42
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,407
No, don't, please don't...!

43
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,409
Sam says Diane makes
him feel all squooshy!

44
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,911
(crowd taunting)

45
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,162
MAN: Ooh, Sammy!

46
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,965
"Squooshy."

47
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,967
Oh!

48
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,972

Excuse me, young man.

56
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,514
I'm Dr. Sumner Sloane.

57
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,016
I'm looking for Diane Chambers.

58
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,518
Gee, I hope she's not sick.

59
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,520
No, I'm not a medical doctor.

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,523
I'm in the Literature
Department at Boston University

61
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,024
where I occupy a chair.

62
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,026
Huh. Hey, don't worry about it.

63
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,028
That's all I did in school, too.

64
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,232
Hey, that's Sumner Sloane there.

65
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,234
The famous
Sumner Sloane--

66
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,119
the man who jilted Diane?

67
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,905
Yup. He made a bigger doofus out of her

68
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,906
than she made out of you.

69
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,907
No easy trick.

70
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,408
Oh, boy, yeah, that was one

71
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,410
of your major league dumps, too.

72
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,411
Poor little Diane,

73
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,914
left there on our doorstep, you know,

74
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,416
turning to us for, uh,
shelter from life's storm.

75
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,919
Boy, oh, boy, it seems
like a long time ago,

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,420
doesn't it, Normie? Yep.

77
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,923
A lot's changed since
that fateful night, eh?

78
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,924
Yeah. As I recall,

79
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,926
you were sitting over
there, drinking a beer,

80
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,928
and I was sitting right
here having a beer,

81
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,429
kind of wishing you'd shut up.

82
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,932
Good memory. Yeah.

83
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,435
(Diane laughing)

84
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,437
Hello, Diane.

85
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,439
Hello, Sumner.

86
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,942
Hello, Sam, old man. Sumner.

87
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,277
I understand
congratulations are in order.

88
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,780
You've heard about our engagement?

89
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,281
Yes. Wonderful news travels fast.

90
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,749
Sam, old man,

91
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,002
I'd like to steal away
your lovely bride-to-be

92
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:40,286
for a private chat.

93
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,088
With your permission, of course.

94
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:42,872
You're not going to try

95
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,874
to take her away from
me, are you, Sumner?

96
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:46,876
It's obvious you've
cast a spell over Diane

97
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,878
that someone with even
my considerable charms

98
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,380
would find difficult to break.

99
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,883
Well, maybe with your charms
and a jug of cheap wine.

100
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,387
Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

101
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,389
Perhaps you've heard of me.

102
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:00,890
Not till this moment.

103
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,891
Well, it just so happens

104
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,394
that I was once engaged to Diane, too.

105
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:08,898
Ah. Is there anyone in this
bar you haven't been engaged to?

106
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,400
Well,

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,901
I believe the floor is now open

108
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:14,404
to nominations for "pompous
ass of the year" award.

109
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,410
Hey, uh, remember us, uh, Dr. Sloane?

110
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,828
How could I forget?

111
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,329
Barney, Wally, Ed.

112
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,719
When I heard of your
impending marriage to Sam,

113
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,088
I thought perhaps I
had overestimated you.

114
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:35,008
So, I pored through
everything that you'd written--

115
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,810
letters, poems, short stories.

116
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,012
The pages burned

117
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,980
with your talent, Diane,

118
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,482
and I was singed.

119
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,934
Why are you telling me this?

120
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,853
I was so impressed by one
of your unfinished novels,

121
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,855
I took the liberty of
sending it to a friend

122
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,273
who's an editor at Houghton Mifflin.

123
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,575
You had no right to do that.

124
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,494
While he concurs with me

125
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,497
that it's rough, embryonic and immature,

126
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,998
he loves it...

127
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,918
...and thinks it has

128
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,419
a very good chance of being published.

129
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,873
Published?

130
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,710
I knew it.

131
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,711
I felt it.

132
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,713
I've never been more alive in my life

133
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,214
than when I was writing that.

134
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,716
Which one was it?

135
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,353
Jocasta's Conundrum.

136
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,637
Yes!

137
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,639
(giggling)

138
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,141
I'm going to be a novelist.

139
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:26,642
I'm going to be a novelist.

140
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,145
Now, this doesn't guarantee publication.

141
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:30,646
He has other people to convince.

142
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,149
And he'll have to see the finished work.

143
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,536
Actually, I haven't quite finished it.

144
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,403
I haven't written

145
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,374
for... five years.

146
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,376
That's about the same amount of time

147
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,879
you've been interred in
this, uh, tomb of thought.

148
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,884
Oh... roughly.

149
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,887
Well, then it's imperative
you get out of here

150
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,889
and finish this novel immediately.

151
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,391
You can use my cabin in Maine.

152
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,394
It's where I go to do most
of my profound thinking.

153
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,397
You'll love it!

154
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,899
Ted Koppel has a little
place right down the road.

155
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,320
I can't.

156
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,822
I'm going to marry Sam.

157
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,575
Do you realize the implications

158
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,859
of the choice you're making?

159
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,361
There's no choice.

160
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,364
A woman can be married and write, too.

161
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,865
Oh, I get it.

162
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,368
You're going to write
the great American novel

163
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:28,371
in between driving the
kids to Little League games,

164
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,873
changing a litter box
and teaching Sam pinochle

165
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:33,876
so you can finally have
the Mundanes over to dinner.

166
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,882
Well, even if I can't
do both, I don't care.

167
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,384
Of course you don't.

168
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,386
Sam's bludgeoned all
the spirit out of you

169
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:45,388
and dragged you back down to his level.

170
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:46,856
No one was dragged, Sumner.

171
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:47,857
Sam and I

172
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,360
walked arm in arm to his level.

173
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,282
I think you'd better leave now.

174
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,285
Yes, I'll leave.

175
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,286
But the time will come

176
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,288
when you'll look back on this moment

177
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,290
and realize you've
made a terrible mistake.

178
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,292
I'm glad I won't be
around to witness that.

179
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,743
So am I.

180
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:08,661
Touch?.

181
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,665
How appropriate that as
I take my leave of you,

182
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,668
you are holding the eight ball.

183
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,171
Good-bye, Diane.

184
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,175
(ball rolls, then drops)

185
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,855
DIANE: Sam?

186
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,106
Yeah.

187
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:37,940
Oh, there you are.

188
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:39,275
Where have you been?

189
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,194
I, uh, was at the dentist.

190
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,696
I, uh, had something caught in my teeth.

191
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,035
What are you up to there?

192
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,454
I've started addressing
our wedding invitations.

193
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,839
So...

194
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,590
what did Sumner have to say?

195
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,376
Well, it seems he has submitted

196
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,379
the manuscript of one of my novels

197
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,881
to an editor

198
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,383
who thinks it might be publishable

199
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,384
with a little work.

200
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,887
Well, that's great, isn't it?

201
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,272
Yeah, it's...

202
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,057
very flattering.

203
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,059
And I'm not easily flattered.

204
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,061
Oh, I know, I know.

205
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,946
That's, uh...

206
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,115
That's one of the most
remarkable things about you.

207
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,817
Thank you, Sam.

208
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,286
Hey, wait a minute.

209
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,289
You know, this... this
could work out perfectly.

210
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,792
Why don't we... why don't
we postpone the wedding?

211
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,663
Postpone it? Yeah, absolutely.

212
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:36,132
I mean, you-you could go
off and finish your book,

213
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,134
and it'd give me a
chance to do something

214
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,635
I've wanted to do all my life.

215
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,137
What?

216
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:43,055
What do you mean what?

217
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,924
You want me to name it?

218
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,728
That'd be good.

219
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,148
Well, I, uh, take a trip to the Orient.

220
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:55,401
Yeah, yeah, I always
wanted to go to the Orient.

221
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,021
You've never said anything
about a trip to the Orient.

222
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,990
Well, not in so many words, but I mean,

223
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,359
you know how much I like
Chinese food. It's...

224
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,531
Sam, I've waited several
years for this marriage,

225
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:11,534
and I don't want to wait any longer.

226
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,419
I'm starting to get scared.

227
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,171
Oh, no. Something always seems

228
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,456
to screw us up--
usually it's you.

229
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,210
Sometimes it's me.

230
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,378
Let's get married now.

231
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,714
What do you mean "now"?

232
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,599
Now. Tonight.

233
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,467
Tonight?

234
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,469
Yeah.

235
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,471
You know, what's the rush?

236
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,856
I mean, it feels like

237
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,641
you want to do this fast

238
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,027
so that you don't change your mind.

239
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:41,814
You're the one who seems
to be changing his mind.

240
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,065
No, no, I'm not, no, I'm not.

241
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,984
Well, good, then there's no problem.

242
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,485
Let's marry tonight.

243
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,487
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

244
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,991
We ought to think about this.

245
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,493
All right, fine.

246
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,879
You sit down and think about it.

247
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,383
I'll make us some tea.

248
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,751
If you get stuck, call me.

249
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,803
I'll come in and jiggle your head.

250
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,012
Tea time, dear.

251
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:19,068
I've had a great life.

252
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:23,939
My grandson's a 25-game
winner with the... Red Sox.

253
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:26,275
Got the prettiest wife in town.

254
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,693
And I can still fire off

255
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,613
the old booster rockets now and again.

256
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,335
And don't forget your pinochle's
coming along quite well.

257
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,121
Yes, yes. You know, now
that I got the hang of it,

258
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,506
I kind of like that game.

259
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,343
Who called there a minute ago?

260
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,213
That was your granddaughter, Samantha.

261
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,965
She said to tell her gramps that she has

262
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:52,435
a new boyfriend.

263
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,936
Uh-oh.

264
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:54,937
What's he like?

265
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,940
Well, he sounds like a fine young man.

266
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,309
She said he has his doctorate

267
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,729
in laser beam demolecularization.

268
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,198
There's only one thing
that kept me from going

269
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,450
into that myself.

270
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,202
I don't have the brains of a turnip.

271
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,204
(both chuckling)

272
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,206
(coughing)

273
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,575
(knock at door)

274
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,078
I'll get it.

275
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,583
Maybe you better do it.

276
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,004
I'd rather watch you walk anyway.

277
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,006
You know, it's absolutely amazing

278
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,758
how you've held onto your figure.

279
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,978
Well, it's amazing how
you've held onto it, too.

280
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:41,567
Oh, Clifford. (laughs)

281
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,070
Er... you hit the jackpot there, Diane.

282
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,071
Oh, thanks so much.

283
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,074
Would you like to come
in and have a cup of tea?

284
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,076
Oh, don't mind if I do.

285
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,577
Good.

286
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,499
When are you going to retire, Cliff?

287
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,750
"Retire"?

288
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,619
(chuckling): Hells bells, Sammy.

289
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,924
Being a mailman's still
the surest way I know

290
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,927
of, uh, meeting the, uh...

291
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,380
Women. Women.

292
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,216
(coughing)

293
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,218
(knock at door)

294
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:18,604
I'll get it.

295
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,439
No, maybe not.

296
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,809
Let me.

297
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,314
We seem to be very popular today.

298
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,700
Evening, everybody.

299
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,535
Norm! Norm!

300
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,537
Norman.

301
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:35,404
What's up, Norm?

302
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:37,706
Me, about 30 times a night.

303
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,627
Norman,

304
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,996
shall I get you a cup so
you can join us in some tea?

305
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,798
No, no, thanks, Diane.

306
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,799
I'm just here

307
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,716
to pick up Cliffie.

308
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,219
We're going to go on over to Woody's bar

309
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,221
and have a few beers.

310
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,589
Well, tell Woody we say hi.

311
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,090
Mm-hmm, yeah.

312
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,342
How's he doing with the bar?

313
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,676
Well, Sammy, he's, uh, turned it

314
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,678
into a real family enterprise, you know.

315
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,397
Hmm. He's, uh...

316
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:04,183
He and, uh, his kid are...
are working behind the bar,

317
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,184
and he's got his-his wife

318
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,186
and his daughter
actually waiting tables.

319
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,571
And in the evening,

320
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,855
they, uh, apparently

321
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,190
take off all their shoes and socks

322
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,192
and add up the receipts.

323
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,195
(all laughing) (Sam coughing)

324
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,197
Oh...

325
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,615
Yep.

326
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,617
We're out of here. Cliffie?

327
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,619
Women.

328
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,121
No, we're out of here.

329
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:30,626
Er... eh... really, eh,
nice seeing you two again.

330
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:33,879
Eh, Diane, you get, uh,
better looking every year.

331
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,714
Why, thank you, Clifford.

332
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:40,219
Yeah, wish I could say
the same thing about Vera.

333
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,221
Oh, Norman, didn't you
tell us that Vera still has

334
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,606
the figure of a young girl?

335
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,724
That's right; it's tattooed on her back.

336
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,478
(coughing)

337
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:52,481
Good one. Good one.

338
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,484
You know, Sam, Mm-hmm?

339
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:58,487
we are blessed.

340
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:02,491
With wonderful friends
and a wonderful family.

341
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,494
It certainly has been a good life.

342
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you have any regrets?

343
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,003
None.

344
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,422
Now, what about that book

345
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,424
you were going to write a long time ago?

346
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,925
Now, don't you ever wish

347
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,927
that you had done that
instead of marrying me?

348
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,931
Oh,... that was years
and years ago, Sam.

349
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,434
I know that, but don't
you have any regrets?

350
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,438
Sam Malone...

351
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,941
I wouldn't trade one
minute of my life with you

352
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,944
for a Nobel Prize in Literature.

353
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,413
(phone ringing)

354
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,200
I'll get it.

355
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,203
Oh.

356
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:51,206
Hello.

357
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,709
I don't know why, Carla--
because I love her!

358
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,212
Now, can we just leave
this alone, please?!

359
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,685
DIANE: Teatime, Sam.

360
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,524
So, what's your answer?

361
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,526
"Yes" or "I need more
time to think about it"?

362
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,778
Hmm.

363
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,613
Okay.

364
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,614
You mean it?

365
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,117
Yeah. Oh, Sam!

366
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,118
You won't regret it.

367
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,619
Well, I just hope you don't.

368
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,121
Oh, I never shall.

369
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,491
Thank you. Mm.

370
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,325
Come on, let's do it.

371
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,210
Let's go get a justice of the peace.

372
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,713
Better yet, let's wed at Cheers.

373
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:31,497
The bar?

374
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,465
It's ideal.

375
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,967
Right there in front
of our dearest friends

376
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,468
who've been witness to our love,

377
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,921
seeing the good times and the bad times,

378
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,306
shared our joys and sorrows.

379
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,307
How perfect.

380
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,310
Those dear souls who will share

381
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,312
our moment of ultimate joy.

382
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,180
Better still, why don't we
have 'em over right here?

383
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,431
We'll do it right here.

384
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,101
Oh, I don't want those
people in my house.

385
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,428
All right, I got 20 bucks
says they won't do it.

386
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,263
All right, well, I got, eh, 30 here

387
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,132
says they, uh, tie the
knot-ski tonight-ski.

388
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,600
I'd like a piece of that,
Cliff, because you see,

389
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,102
I'm convinced that the words "I do"

390
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,854
are not in the woman's vocabulary.

391
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,057
Eh, all right, let's see
how much you got there.

392
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,859
Come on, put your money
where your mouth is.

393
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,360
Hey, everybody!

394
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,363
ALL: Hey!

395
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,365
Wish me luck.

396
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,367
(guests cheering)

397
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:29,238
Sammy, uh, let me just give
you a little piece of advice

398
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,741
I wish somebody would've given me once.

399
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,243
Run, Sammy, run.

400
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,128
Run like the wind.

401
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,415
Disappear into the night. Go, Sam, go!

402
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,218
(piano playing "Wedding March")

403
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,475
(sobbing)

404
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,850
(music stops)

405
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,769
(whimpering)

406
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,771
I understand that this has been

407
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,156
a long time in coming.

408
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:09,278
So without further delay, uh,
we'll get to the matter at hand.

409
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,113
You, Sam, and you, Diane,

410
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,415
have complied with the general laws

411
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,417
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

412
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,170
and there are no apparent
impediments to this marriage.

413
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,172
(wailing)

414
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,545
Therefore, do you, Sam Malone,

415
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,298
take this woman, Diane Chambers,
to be your lawfully wedded wife

416
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,800
till death do you part?

417
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,052
I do.

418
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,138
(shrieking)

419
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,857
(phone rings)

420
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,726
Cheers.

421
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,227
Oh, just a second.

422
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,228
Miss Chambers, it's for you.

423
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:48,067
Woody, I'm kind of busy.

424
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,952
Oh.

425
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,453
Uh, listen, she's getting married.

426
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,956
Can I take a message?

427
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,824
You're kidding.

428
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,659
Oh, that's...

429
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,163
Yeah, that's great. That's unbelievable.

430
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,664
You're welcome.

431
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,917
(laughs)

432
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,753
Go ahead.

433
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,590
No, no, don't go ahead.

434
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,258
Woody, what is it?

435
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,394
They're going to publish
Miss Chambers' book.

436
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,680
They're giving her a
big advance to finish it.

437
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,934
Um, to, uh, continue...

438
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,605
Diane Chambers,

439
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,857
do you take this man, Samuel Malone,

440
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,859
to be your lawfully wedded husband

441
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,528
till death do you part?

442
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,830
What?

443
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,331
Oh, yes, of course.

444
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,834
Why wouldn't I?

445
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,335
Well, then, by the powers
vested in me by the governor

446
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,204
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

447
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,206
I now pronounce you
man... No, you don't.

448
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,961
I want to change my answer.

449
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,547
What did he say?

450
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,714
Sam...

451
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,474
Look, you got to do this book.

452
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,442
You have to.

453
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,444
I don't care about the book.

454
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,613
I care about you.

455
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,782
Go ahead, from the beginning, please.

456
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,117
This is inhuman.

457
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,571
You, Sam, and you, Diane,

458
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,575
have complied with the
general regulations and the...

459
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,210
laws of the Commonwealth...

460
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,995
No, no,
w-w-w-wait-wait.

461
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,496
Look, I-I-I don't
want to be married

462
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,965
to a woman who's going to
be always asking, "What if"?

463
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,920
I'll tell you what.

464
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,922
Y-Y-You're
bad at ballet.

465
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,923
You're terrible at acting.

466
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,925
You don't... you can't
draw worth a lick.

467
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,393
You're bad at-at poetry,

468
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,395
photography, cinema and omelets.

469
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,897
I mean, they're going to have to start

470
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:44,399
inventing things for you to be bad at.

471
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,402
Make your point, Sam.

472
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,404
You're-you're good at writing.

473
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,406
I mean, I think we
finally found something

474
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:52,908
you don't stink at.

475
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,910
But, Sam, I-I...

476
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,914
Look, look, this is important for you.

477
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,917
I mean, I-I-I had
my day in the sun.

478
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,285
I-I may not have been

479
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,170
the greatest relief
pitcher in the world...

480
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,954
Yeah, you were, Sammy.

481
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,873
Thank you. The point is...

482
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,375
the point is

483
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,711
I took a shot.

484
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:17,049
You've got to take your shot.

485
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,855
Well...

486
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,724
we've always gone with our feelings.

487
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,858
Yeah.

488
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,612
Are these your feelings?

489
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,115
Yes, they are.

490
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,321
I only want to do what's best for us.

491
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,824
So...

492
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,245
do you agree that we
shouldn't get married?

493
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,836
I do.

494
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,004
(squeals)

495
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,341
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,344

DIANE: Well, Maine awaits.

499
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,249
See you in six months.

500
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,250
Right.

501
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,252
Right.

502
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,716
Next time, let's have our
wedding somewhere else.

503
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,719
Anything you say.

504
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,607
(sighs)

505
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,363
(sighs)

506
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:55,864
Hey.

507
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:57,783
Have a good life.

508
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,787
"Have a good life"?

509
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,071
What?

510
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,489
Well, that's something you say

511
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,991
when something's over.

512
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,912
Sam, I'm going away for six months.

513
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,414
That's all.

514
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,334
So no more of this
"have a good life" stuff.

515
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,086
You never know. You-you
could die. I could die.

516
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,388
The world could end.

517
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,890
One of us could bump our heads and, uh,

518
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,392
wander the streets

519
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:26,395
for the rest of our life with amnesia.

520
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,398
Or maybe one of us will decide

521
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:30,899
they want something else.

522
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,237
None of those things will happen.

523
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,024
I'll be back here.

524
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,859
I will.

525
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,779
I'll see you in six months.

526
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,198
Okay?

527
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,199
Okay.

528

Okay. That's better.

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,768
