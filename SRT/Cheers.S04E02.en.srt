1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,596
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,917
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong, Mr Peterson?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,753
It's my anniversary, I have nothing
for Vera, and stores are closed.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,752
Normie's in big trouble now.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,990
Will Mrs Peterson
give you the cold shoulder?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,835
It's not the cold shoulder I mind.
It's the hard knee.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,318
Well, not to worry there, Norm.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,118
I think with your wit
and resourcefulness,

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,555
you'll come up with a suitable gift.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,838
Yeah.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,309
You're absolutely right, Cliffie.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,430
I tried. I'm doomed.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,952
I know where there's
a gas station open.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,588
Why don't you get her
a can of 40-weight.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,478
- Very funny.
- Hey, why not give her

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,029
the best gift of all, Mr Peterson?

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,872
A night of romance.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,349
Carla, where's that gas station at?

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,549
Come on. Come on, Norm.
You can do better than that.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,631
- What?
- That ashtray's better than that.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,791
Come on, man.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,991
Ashtray, huh?

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,716
It's a little shoddy, but...

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,553
You know, with a nice pack
of cigarettes or something,

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,396
a nice snappy new pack of matches,
I think we got something here.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,471
- Hey, hey, hey, Norm!
- Does Vera even smoke?

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,949
Oh, yeah, she's been
known to smoke.

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,917
Occasionally after sex.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,036
Usually during.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,955
Well, not the best I've had,
but it'll serve. Refill, Sam.

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,509
Frasier, I'm not sure how
to get into this,

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,194
but your bar bill's up to 500 dollars.

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,599
My God. Really?

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,435
I'm shocked.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,551
Well, I promised myself that
if I reached 500 dollars, I'd quit.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,073
So that does it.

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,913
I'll raise my limit to 1,000.

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,671
I hope you understand
it's just business,

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,115
but 500's a little out
of my comfort zone there.

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,191
Oh, I understand, Sam.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,158
Seems nobody wants to pay a man
for sitting around and drinking all day.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,392
Yeah, it's a world gone mad,
huh, Fras?

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,033
Sam, I've come to
a very important decision.

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,111
I've just taken stock of myself.

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,431
It's not exactly AT&T, is it?

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,118
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
of my shattered life.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,953
But in order to do that,
you gotta hit rock bottom first.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,838
For you, that's three flights up.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,278
Carla, you wanna see if anyone
in the back has open wounds to salt?

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,837
Spoilsport.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,275
- Sam, you are my inspiration.
- Well, thank you.

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,829
You, too, were a worthless,
drooling drunk.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,355
Carla, hold it a second.

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,873
Sam, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,190
See, the point is that
you pulled yourself together.

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,115
I have to rebuild my life, my career,
my reputation, my self-esteem.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,397
I'm no longer worthy
to practice psychiatry,

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,869
but I'm gonna make myself worthy.

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,679
I'll start at the lowest,
most menial level.

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,469
- Sam, who sweeps the floors here?
- Me and Woody.

61
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,596
Mostly Woody. All right, Woody.

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,399
Well, let me do it for both of you.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,109
- You can pay me whatever you'd like.
- Oh, gee, Frasier. I don't know.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,999
No, Sam, I know you think it's beneath
me, but I really need this now.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,435
No, no, I just don't know
where Woody put the broom.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,591
Maybe if you try
in the back closet there.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,752
I mean, it's okay with me, but you sure
you want Diane to see this?

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,879
Yes. Let her confront her guilt
for what she's wrought

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,600
by her refusal to work out
our relationship.

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,036
And if I have a scintilla
of psychological acumen left,

71
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,398
when she sees my humiliation,
she'll eat her liver.

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,238
What's Frasier doing?

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,437
Well, he's the new janitor.

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,677
Poor Frasier.

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,150
I had no idea he'd take it so hard.

76
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,632
This is my saddest romantic legacy.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,349
But I refuse to hold myself responsible.
Do I beg men to fall in love with me?

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,795
I certainly hope not.
I'd like to think I was special.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,790
Have you made any friends
since you moved to Boston?

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,915
A few, if you count cats.

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,437
You're really cute.

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,238
I'd love to have a friend like you.

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,076
Look, Sam. Could we be in on
the inception of a budding romance?

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,912
You talking about a foursome here?

85
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,117
How can you make a sweet,
innocent flirtation

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,670
into something tawdry?

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,071
I could tell you, but it'd be
a lot more fun to show you.

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,029
So, Woody, maybe we could go out
for coffee after you get off work.

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,670
Oh, gee, Lisa,
I'd like to, but I gotta...

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,308
- I gotta do something else.
- What?

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,472
I don't know, but I gotta start right now.
Excuse me.

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,835
My God. I don't think I've ever
seen a man Woody's age

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,797
so painfully shy around women.

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,110
That young lady asked him out.
He refused her.

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,510
- Two beers, Sam.
- Well, maybe...

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,274
Maybe she came on too strong.
Some guys don't like that.

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,237
Well, I know how the lad feels.

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,790
I mean, in the mating ritual,
I like to be the aggressor.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,199
Of course, I don't mind a woman giving
me a clear signal that I caught her eye.

100
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,238
You mean like sticking
a finger down her throat?

101
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,912
Woody hasn't had a date
since he came to work here.

102
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,709
Well, look, later on tonight,
I'm gonna go cruising for chicks,

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,190
a popular pastime
among virile studs of today.

104
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,918
I'll take Woody along.

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,878
There's not a man yet that's
come back from a Clavin love safari

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,237
without some trophy
to hang on his game-room wall.

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,789
Especially the horns, you know.

108
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,750
Hey, Woody. Lookit, later on, I'm
going out scouting for chickereenios.

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,115
- You wanna come?
- Well, sure.

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,669
What is that, some kind of cereal?

111
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,111
I'm not sure,
but I think he means girls.

112
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,999
Yeah, that's right. Come on, Wood.
Look, I got this great pickup line.

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,071
We pull up next to this
cute-looking babe, right?

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,878
I say, "Hey, my friend likes you."

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,350
Yeah, and if that doesn't work,
Cliff throws an egg at her. It's great.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,515
That sounds like swell times, but I'm
not much in the mood for it. Thanks.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,389
Woody, would you mind if I stuck
my big fat nose in your affairs?

118
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,317
Stick your big fat nose
wherever you like, Miss Chambers.

119
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,753
There's no need
to hide your feelings.

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,878
You're afraid of ladies
rejecting you, aren't you?

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,555
No, it's not so much that.
It's just that...

122
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,358
Well, I got this problem.

123
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,116
What problem? We at Cheers
always share our problems.

124
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,353
Besides, we kind of ran out of things
to talk about, so we'd appreciate it.

125
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,912
All right. There's this girl
back home named Beth Curtis,

126
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,833
and she is the most
wonderful girl in the world.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,436
We dated ever since we were kids,
but last year we split up.

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,795
You know, I wanted to travel
around and see the world.

129
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,110
She wanted to stay in lndiana.

130
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,238
At first I thought it would be okay...

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,114
...but now I just can't seem
to get her out of my mind.

132
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,353
Everything I do, everywhere I go,
everything I see reminds me of her.

133
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,279
Beth.

134
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,636
Poor kid, huh?

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,869
Oh, wait a second.
Was that your meddling "hmm"?

136
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,476
Oh, Sam, we have to get
those two back together.

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,517
There's nothing sadder than a man

138
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,353
who wants his maiden
and is denied her.

139
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,795
It tears my heart out.

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,875
Frasier. You're getting dirt
on my new Joan & Davids.

141
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,433
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,033
What do you say to a beer, Normie?

143
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,555
Hi, sailor. New in town?

144
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,398
Where's Diane?
Back from the airport yet?

145
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,913
No, no, not yet.

146
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,230
What's Diane doing
down at the airport?

147
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,039
Well, we all got together
and thought it'd be kind of fun

148
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,316
to get Woody's girlfriend
out here and surprise him.

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,674
She's still picking her up.

150
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,115
What do you mean,
"we all got together"?

151
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,033
I didn't all get together.
Did you, Norm?

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,589
Yeah. Yeah, it was
a good meeting, actually.

153
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,799
Had some hors d'oeuvres. It kind of
turned into a little party, you know.

154
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,916
Well, you might have invited me.

155
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,356
Oh, we might have,
but we wanted to enjoy ourselves.

156
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,720
- Hey, Fras, how's the job going, bud?
- Oh, great.

157
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,350
Yeah, I hear you're really
cleaning up in your new business.

158
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,719
At least I was invited to the party.
Great rumaki, Sam.

159
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,111
Everyone, this is Beth Curtis.

160
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,271
- Hi, Beth.
- Hi, everybody.

161
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,839
How you doing? Sam Malone.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,831
I guess-- I guess
Woody told you all about me.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,195
I haven't spoken to Woody in ages.

164
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,874
That's all right. What could he
tell you that you can't see?

165
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,559
Sam, please.

166
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,630
I'd really like to thank whoever all's
responsible for bringing me out here.

167
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
- Yeah. Cliff Clavin, do-gooder.
- Hi.

168
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,916
Gosh, I can't believe
how big this city is.

169
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,399
Yeah, yeah, quite a place.

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,588
You know, Boston is the hub of Boston
proper, which comprises some--

171
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,070
There's probably, what,
two and three-quarter million people

172
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,958
spread out in 83 cities and towns.

173
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,838
Get out of here.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,513
You question my figures?

175
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,275
No, I want you to get out of here.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,911
So where's my butterball?

177
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,553
- You mean Woody?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,153
He doesn't mind me
calling him that.

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,912
He's not very sensitive
about his weight.

180
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,196
Woody's not fat, Beth.

181
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,669
He was the last time I saw him.

182
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,150
- Wow. He lost weight too?
- Too?

183
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,869
Yeah. I don't like to brag or anything,
but I just lost 50 pounds.

184
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,315
I don't think Woody
will even recognise me.

185
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,395
Beth, that's wonderful.

186
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,028
Norman, isn't that wonderful?

187
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,711
Yeah, it's great. Great.

188
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,156
You know, actually, I just lost
a little weight recently myself.

189
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,629
No, I just found it.

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,154
Beth? You shrunk.

191
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,436
I shrunk? Look at you.

192
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,956
Wow, my hands can touch.

193
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,111
This is a dream come true.
What are you doing here?

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,113
- Well, your friends brought me out.
- They did?

195
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,556
Thanks, guys.
You've been so good to me.

196
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,995
In fact, next to
the Twilley brothers back home,

197
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,673
you're the closest friends I have.

198
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,831
Woody, after you left,

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,515
both Twilley brothers
made improper advances to me.

200
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,911
Hey, that makes you
my closest friends.

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,511
Woody, why don't you
take the rest of the day off.

202
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,113
Oh, really? Thanks, Sam.

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,874
- Look at you. I can't believe it.
- I can't believe it either.

204
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,431
You know, in high school, we were
voted the couple most likely to explode.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,275
Hey, I'll show you the sights.
What do you wanna see first?

206
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,953
I'd kind of like to get a bite.

207
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,519
Didn't you eat on the plane?

208
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,148
Yeah, but not enough, I guess,
because I'm kind of hungry again.

209
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,232
Yeah, I'm famished. See you later.

210
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,792
Do you find that strange?

211
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,552
The first thing they wanted
to do was eat?

212
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,597
Yeah, yeah, Woody just got back
from lunch too.

213
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,558
Yeah, I'll say it's strange.
If I hadn't seen my girl in that long,

214
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,676
I know what the first thing
on her mind would be.

215
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,354
"How did he find me in Tibet?"

216
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,199
Sam, I finally did it.
It took three days,

217
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,716
but I removed every trace of
Carla's number from the men's room.

218
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,715
Would you mind
your own business?

219
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,672
Frasier, for God's sake,
hasn't this gone on long enough?

220
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,718
If you're trying to make me
feel guilty, you succeeded.

221
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,350
Don't flatter yourself,
Your Highness.

222
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,429
I'm working here because I enjoy it.

223
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,477
The Crane family
is no stranger to hard work.

224
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,596
When my ancestors
first came to this country,

225
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,115
they had nothing but strong backs,
a dream of freedom

226
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,714
and a small personal fortune.

227
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,630
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a life to live.

228
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,598
Sam, where do you keep
the Jonny Mop?

229
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,234
Sam, stop him.

230
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,914
Don't let him put on
this stupid display.

231
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,878
Well, sweetheart, I'm helping
him regain his self-respect.

232
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,158
Besides, people come here specifically
to see the sweeping psychiatrist.

233
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,158
Sorry I'm late.

234
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,833
Beth and I had to go
to Baskin-Robbins

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,434
for the changing of the flavours.

236
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,557
Woody, how are you
and Beth getting along?

237
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,836
Oh, great.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,560
We had this wonderful
breakfast this morning.

239
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,393
Pancakes and sausages
and hash browns.

240
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,357
And then we discovered
this great little treat.

241
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,431
You know how when you
get to the end of a meal

242
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,636
and you find something
to kind of top it off?

243
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,109
- You mean like a sorbet?
- No, like eggs Benedict.

244
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,077
It really hit the spot.

245
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,312
Woody, that's kind of like topping
off a steak dinner with pork chops.

246
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,752
- Great idea.
- Well, it's not original.

247
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,832
It's the Hungry Heifer
Carnivore Platter.

248
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,277
Woody, it's none of my business,
but aren't you and Beth worried

249
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,192
that you might put back on
some of the weight

250
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,874
you worked so hard to take off?

251
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,510
No, we're very careful. We always
stop eating before we get lightheaded.

252
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,551
Oh, who am I kidding?

253
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,711
It's happening all over again.

254
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,236
I swore after I took that 1 00 pounds off
that I'd never tub out again.

255
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,234
Now I'm gonna have to
send home for my fat clothes.

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,119
I don't know what comes over us
when we get together.

257
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,753
You know, Woody,
I thought of something.

258
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,799
I have old drinking buddies I can't
be around without wanting a drink.

259
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,234
Automatic thing.

260
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,439
I think that maybe Beth is--
Well, she's like your old eating buddy.

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,319
- Very good, Sam.
- Well, thank you.

262
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,473
And just when we were about to hang
a "for rent" sign on Sam's forehead.

263
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,230
He's right, Woody.

264
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,868
Friends with whom we share
a common vice

265
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,793
sometimes reinforce our behaviour.

266
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,350
I'm sure that's what's happening
in your case.

267
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,796
Thank you, amateur psychologists...

268
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,068
...for your simple-minded
diagnostic attempts.

269
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,151
Now, Woody, tell me,

270
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,470
do you come from
a strict moral upbringing?

271
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,349
- What do you mean by that?
- Well,

272
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,355
do you and Beth feel that
premarital relations are wrong?

273
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,351
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.

274
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,159
Beth and I feel there's some things
you just don't talk about.

275
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,630
- Like what?
- I don't know. We never talk about it.

276
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,318
Now listen to me, Woody.

277
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,869
As healthy but moral
human beings,

278
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,751
you and Beth sublimated your lust
into the sensual pleasure of eating.

279
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,559
As your fondness grew,
so did your appetites.

280
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,678
Well, in short, food became
your substitute for sex.

281
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,070
Vera became mine.

282
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,117
You really think that's what it is,
Dr Crane?

283
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,952
Yes, it's quite common.
Well, for example,

284
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,475
when Diane left Sam,
and he started drinking again,

285
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,154
he was filling the void
that Diane left.

286
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,675
And Diane filled her emptiness...

287
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,040
...by toying with
and destroying a man

288
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,237
who's her cultural and intellectual
superior in every way!

289
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,954
You see the point
I'm trying to make, Woody.

290
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,752
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I rest my case.

291
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,877
Go rest your mouth.

292
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,917
Hey. You mean to tell me
you've never slept with Beth?

293
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,758
Well, it's simple, then.
You sleep with her, you stop eating.

294
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,309
What a great reason too.
I mean, as if you needed one.

295
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,993
Sam, I can't do that.

296
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,631
I can't ask a nice girl like Beth
to sleep with me out of wedlock.

297
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,076
The younger generation.
I just don't know what to say to them.

298
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,119
Why don't you just marry her?

299
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,478
I don't think we're ready
for marriage yet.

300
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,837
Forget Frasier's Freudian rantings.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,391
As anyone will tell you,
I am a Skinnerian behaviourist.

302
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,436
I say we must address
your symptoms.

303
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,718
You and Beth must learn to retrain
your eating habits together.

304
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,516
We've thought about diets before.
All it does is make us hungrier.

305
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,033
Well, then I'll help.

306
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,830
I'll take you out to dinner and show you
how to eat a light but satisfying meal.

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,513
Oh, well, I'll try anything.

308
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,319
Hey, Sam, you wanna join us?

309
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,559
Well, Sam could join us
if he so desires.

310
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,631
We'll have a...

311
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,632
...sparse but nutritious meal
and a lot of delightful conversation.

312
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,192
Thanks, Diane, but I got something
a little more fun planned for myself.

313
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,669
I'm gonna go home,
shave my head with a cheese grater

314
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,308
while chewing on tinfoil.

315
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,314
How about tomorrow night?

316
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,349
- Wasn't it good?
- Yeah.

317
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,875
Sam, can I tempt you
with the last piece of broccoli?

318
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,154
Depends on what
you're gonna do with it.

319
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,598
Aren't we just the trendsetters?

320
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,230
It's not everyone that could walk
into an elite French restaurant

321
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,038
and order nothing but vegetables.

322
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,399
Yeah, I gotta admit, I don't feel as full
as if I had eaten food or something.

323
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,390
Really, Diane, we appreciate
what you're trying to do,

324
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,154
but what do you say we cleanse
our palate with some éclairs?

325
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,438
Yo, waiter!

326
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,314
Yes, a sense of humour's
very important when dieting.

327
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,714
But remember, this one meal
isn't going to change your lives.

328
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,314
You're going to have to continue
this way on your own.

329
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,311
You think we can, Woody?

330
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,040
Oh, sure.
Yeah, this was kind of nice.

331
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,716
You know, I usually feel so full
I can't really do anything.

332
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,791
- But now l...
- I know.

333
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,918
I feel a lot more energetic.

334
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,672
You know, I've been thinking

335
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,276
about what the janitor at Cheers
said about sublimation.

336
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,034
About what?

337
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,829
Well, he said that, for us,
eating took the place of...

338
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,949
Woody, maybe you should
go over to that table over there

339
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,477
so you can be heard above
Sam's termite impression.

340
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,756
Yeah, that might be better.

341
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,070
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,634
Eating took the place of what?

343
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,509
Well, you know, that subject
that you don't like to talk about.

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,272
What subject don't I like
to talk about?

345
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
You know, that subject
that you never talk about.

346
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,837
The reason we never talk about that is
because you don't wanna talk about it.

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,116
I don't mind talking about it.

348
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,192
In fact, I think about it all the time.

349
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,078
Well, I don't mind
talking about it either.

350
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,550
- In fact, I think about it too.
- You think about it too?

351
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,599
Then maybe we should talk about it.

352
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,751
Yeah, I think we should talk about it.

353
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,549
You don't suppose there's a chance
we're not talking about the same thing.

354
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,756
- No.
- No.

355
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,989
Well, I think we've talked
about it enough.

356
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,390
Me too.

357
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,148
Well, I think we're gonna
be shoving off.

358
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,912
Where are you going?

359
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,233
We don't wanna talk about it.

360
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,153
- I think I understand.
- Yeah.

361
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,150
Understand what?

362
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,436
Oh, yeah, right.

363
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,478
Probably gonna get
something to eat, right?

364
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,870
Don't be silly.

365
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,154
- lsn't it beautiful?
- What's that?

366
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,754
Two people in love.

367
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,710
Yeah, you said it, all right.

368
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,593
- What?
- I just had the funniest stray thought.

369
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,591
Remember the first tryst
you and I shared?

370
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,676
Yeah, I think I had
Cheez Whiz on my half.

371
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,040
I'm talking about making love.

372
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,191
I know.

373
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,912
Yeah, of course I remember.

374
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,992
It was... It was great, wasn't it?

375
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,434
It was wonderful.

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,751
Yeah, I think we gave new meaning
to the word "cooking."

377
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,038
Sometimes I thought
it would go on forever.

378
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,715
Hey, I came pretty darn close
a couple of times, didn't l?

379
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,079
That's not what I meant.

380
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,319
You were wonderful.

381
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,194
Yeah, you were
pretty wonderful yourself.

382
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,235
- It can be so wonderful, can't it, Sam?
- You bet.

383
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,837
Thank God there's no danger
of all of that starting up again.

384
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,037
Right. We know what kind of hell
that would lead to.

385
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,791
Amen.

386
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,670
Will there be anything else?

387
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,918
- I want two of these. Keep it coming.
- Make it three.

388
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,390
I think the word is "chocolate."
I want more chocolate.

389
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,315
That's it. Go away. Go away.

390
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,594
We must come back.
