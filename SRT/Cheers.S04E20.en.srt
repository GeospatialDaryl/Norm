1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,631
Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,709
Miss Chambers,
can I ask you something?

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,074
You're a girl, right?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,276
Well, I'm a woman.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,192
Well, that's close enough.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,839
You see, in about five minutes

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,673
I'm going out on my first date
with a city girl,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,637
and I'm really nervous about it.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,597
You know, I'm afraid I might
get tongue-tied

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,513
and make a fool of myself.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,994
I don't want that to get in the way
of me picking up the babes.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,032
Et tu, Woody?

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,350
After only a few months
here at Cheers,

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,080
you're starting to talk
like the other reprobates.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,317
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers,
but, you know...

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,028
...that's not enough. I wanna be
smooth with the ladies like Sam.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,313
Well, I think I can help you out.
Have a seat.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,031
A good conversationalist
is usually a good listener.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,755
I've found that people love
to talk about themselves.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,592
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,594
People have an endless fascination
with their own little world.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,399
It's an observation I made
as a small child,

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,551
although I've never understood
why it holds true.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,639
I, myself, have always found many
more interesting topics to talk about.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,590
Of course, I've always made it a point
to broaden my horizons.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,552
As a matter of fact,

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,792
I was reading the New York Times
at the age of 4.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,998
And from then, on to the classics.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,835
Of course, it caused some hardships
as a youngster,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,913
always being far and away
the brightest in the class.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,991
Usually, the brightest in the class

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,598
is regarded as some sort of
a pimply faced egghead.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,638
I'm sorry, Clifford,
what was your question again?

34
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,679
Boy, just when you think
you can't get any older,

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,239
you go and read the paper.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,277
- Why? What happened?
- Look at this.

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,670
There's gonna be a reunion
of The Boston Boppers.

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,512
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,148
- Who are The Boston Boppers?
- It's not a who, it's a what.

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,197
Like you.

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,110
It was a local TV show,
kind of like American Bandstand.

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,271
- Carla used to dance on it.
- Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,431
I danced my way
into New England's heart.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,477
Till they made up that stupid rule.

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,908
What rule's that?

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,995
The one that said that pregnant
16-year-olds can't Hully Gully on TV.

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,119
Those were repressive times.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,033
Well, you must be very excited
about the reunion, Carla.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,315
I'm not going.

50
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,351
Oh, how come?
I thought you loved that place.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,039
I did love it.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,078
But Nick was my dance partner.

53
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,874
That was before
we had to get married.

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,237
Boy, they sure have
tough dance laws up here.

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,473
Wipe that table off there,
will you, Woody?

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,631
We were a great team.

57
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,628
We really got along
when we were dancing.

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,997
And when we were dancing,
if you know what I mean.

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,038
Yes, it's frighteningly clear.

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,675
Well, why don't you just ask Nick
if he wants to go?

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,034
Forget it.

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,435
Oh, come on. You're not gonna
pass up all that fun

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,591
just for a little pride, are you?

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,113
It's not only fun.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,155
There's a chance to win 500 bucks
and a trip to Hawaii

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,515
in that dance contest.
And we could do it.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,439
- Then what--?
- There's no way I'd call and ask him.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,510
And I really don't want anyone else
getting any crazy ideas, like calling him

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,717
in Atlantic City at 555-4397.

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,713
Well, here I go,

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,237
out of earshot in the poolroom
for about 1 5 minutes.

72
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,071
Oh, Carla.

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,030
Hey, I got an idea.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,350
Why don't one of us call Nick?

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,952
That'd be a good idea.

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,351
- Anybody know the area code?
- 609!

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,313
Thank you.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,309
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,674
How's life, Mr. Peterson?

80
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,236
Oh, I look at it every once in a while
when I'm in the john.

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,918
I didn't mean the magazine.

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,792
Neither did l.

83
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,589
- So how's that job-hunt going, Norm?
- Great.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,675
- Hey, you got one, huh?
- Yeah, well. No, no. Vera did.

85
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,319
Boy, Normie, don't you feel
the least bit emasculated?

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,674
I mean, isn't it gut-wrenching

87
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,751
to watch your wife go off to work
every morning?

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,718
It's gut-wrenching
to watch Vera do anything.

89
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,031
- Who are you?
- I'm Woody Boyd.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,196
Big deal.

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,476
Where--? Where is everybody?

92
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,395
Oh, there's those two bozos.

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,358
Nick, Loretta.

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,358
Hello, sweetcakes.

95
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,476
You been thinking about me?

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,438
Only during flea-and-tick season.

97
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,637
Yeah? Well, in my neighbourhood,
that's all year round.

98
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,350
I'm sure it is.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,748
- Hey, Nick.
- Sam.

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,592
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hello.

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,870
- Excuse me. Glad you made it.
- Of course I made it.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,393
Anytime Carla needs a favour,

103
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,915
and I can benefit financially,
and you send me the bus fare,

104
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,069
I'm there.

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,438
Hey, that's quite a testimonial.

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,269
So how you doing?
You still in the TV-repair business?

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,472
That's a sideline now.
I'm into bigger and better things.

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,193
What do you got there?

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,748
"Nick's Talent Emporium,
Hi-Class Talent for Less.

110
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,592
Nick Tortelli, Talent Manager."

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,034
Well, I'll be darned.

112
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,918
I only got one.

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,998
Nick's managing my career now.

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,515
Oh, yeah? You still singing
with the Grinning Americans?

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,352
Boy, I love that group.

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,471
Oh, step into the '80s.

117
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,676
The Grinning Americans
are so passÃ© it's laughable.

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,513
I'm with the Lemon Sisters.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,069
The Lemon Sisters?

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,549
Yeah, it's Loretta
and two other dames.

121
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,948
I thought up the name.

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,714
Well, don't people confuse you
with the Lennon Sisters?

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,239
I don't know.

124
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,392
Do they throw their drinks
at The Lennon Sisters?

125
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,989
It's pure coincidence
that the names sound alike.

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,912
Besides, I got other people
on my roster.

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,469
I also handle Wayne Newman.

128
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,514
Ginger ale and a Scotch.

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,673
Nick Tortelli? As I live and breathe,
what a surprise.

130
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,229
What do you say, Carla?

131
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,470
Are we gonna kill them
at that dance contest?

132
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,114
You came here to go
to that dance contest with me?

133
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,317
Sure. Yeah, I'm gonna win
that contest and go to Hawaii,

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,596
where the girls wear grass skirts.

135
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,315
And I'm planning on bringing
my hedge clippers.

136
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,952
You gotta admit, the guy's a panic.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,430
I can't believe it. You guys
really used to rock out

138
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,669
on The Boston Boppers, huh?

139
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,956
Sure. We were the stars.
They couldn't stop us.

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,031
Hey, you remember the host,
Floyd Panjeric?

141
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,428
Yeah, what a dork.

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,434
Remember that time we pantsed him
during the station break?

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,592
It's gonna be great to see everybody.

144
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,593
I just hope I can dance as good. I...

145
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,070
- I'm a little rusty.
- Oh, no sweat. I'm in great shape.

146
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,589
I'm glad to hear that, Carla,
but it takes two to tango.

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,273
And if I'm rusty, we're nowhere.

148
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,833
What's that supposed to mean?

149
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,598
Look, I'm trying to be
a gentleman here.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,512
Everybody knew
who was more talented.

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,559
- Yeah, me.
- Give me a break.

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,073
I carried you.

153
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,157
You carried me? I carried you.

154
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,952
In your hat. I carried you!

155
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,639
In your hat! I carried you!

156
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,951
Carla, the fact is, I can go to the dance
with a monkey and win that contest.

157
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,714
Oh, yeah? Who'd lead?

158
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,995
That's it.

159
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,517
If you were the last babe on earth,
I wouldn't dance with you.

160
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,910
I got an idea. I'm gonna show you
how good a dancer I am.

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,475
I'm gonna go with Loretta.

162
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,632
Oh, Nicky, I'm honoured.

163
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,398
We haven't danced
since our wedding.

164
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,471
And we've never danced
fully clothed.

165
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,710
There you go.

166
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,035
It's me and Loretta.
And you, Carla, can eat dirt.

167
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,468
That's what you think.

168
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,598
I'm gonna get myself a new partner
and beat the pants off of you.

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,109
Oh, yeah? Who are you gonna get?

170
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,796
Eddie Csznyk.

171
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,992
Eddie Csznyk, the Polish Prancer?

172
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,394
That's right.

173
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,073
He was always wanting
to dance with me,

174
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,390
and I always turned him down
to go with you.

175
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,068
Yeah, that was the last smart move
you ever made.

176
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,313
Come on, Loretta, we're gonna
practice until our feet bleed.

177
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,118
Okay.

178
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,955
Bye, gang at Cheers.

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,354
Hey, Carla, I saw him, I saw him.
He's dancing down the street.

180
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,034
Boy, he's beautiful.
Makes Fred Astaire look like a gorilla.

181
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,231
- You sure it's him?
- Yeah, I'm sure it's him.

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,472
I called out, "Hey, Eddie Csznyk,"
and he waved back.

183
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,155
This is it. My luck is finally changing.

184
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,153
- Eddie!
- Carla!

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,311
Check out my footwork.

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,989
Eddie, your shoelace is un...

187
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,397
...tied.

188
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,349
Good luck, Carla.
I'm really sorry about this.

189
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,030
- Knock them dead, kid.
- Yeah, yeah.

190
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,509
Listen, mac, I'd put
a cervical collar on that knee.

191
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,795
Give him...

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,679
Give him about
30 milligrams of cc's, huh?

193
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,909
Better make that 40.

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,391
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.

195
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,949
I gotta get another partner.

196
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,112
Does anybody here dance?

197
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,155
I should've known better.

198
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,878
The only time I've seen
any of you dance

199
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,270
is when the restrooms are crowded.

200
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,277
Sam?

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,639
- Why don't you help her out.
- What are you talking about?

202
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,553
Oh, you know very well
what I'm talking about.

203
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,709
You're a great dancer.

204
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,030
You won that trophy
at our ballroom-dancing class.

205
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,111
Don't, don't...

206
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,474
The fact that you talked me into
taking that stupid class

207
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,914
is embarrassing enough.

208
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,429
- Sam, are you going to help Carla?
- No, I'm not.

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,589
- Why not?
- I am a jock.

210
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,909
I've got an image to protect.

211
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,152
I don't want people thinking I'm too
graceful, if you know what I mean.

212
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,038
There's nothing wrong
with being graceful.

213
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,758
I'm not worried
about being graceful.

214
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,269
I'm worried about being too graceful.

215
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,836
It's not like you're being asked
to perform Swan Lake in a tutu.

216
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,871
Why did that particular image
come to mind?

217
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,588
Sam, please.

218
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,435
Baryshnikov is graceful,
and he's one of the sexiest men alive.

219
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,834
Oh, come on. Barysh...

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,991
We all know why women
go for Baryshnikov.

221
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,594
- Oh, and why is that?
- Well, because of what he wears.

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,320
I mean, those tights
have no secrets.

223
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,474
Don't believe everything you see,
Sammy.

224
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,278
You know, I think he's padded.

225
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,476
Probably orders it
from that catalogue.

226
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,871
What catalogue?

227
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,479
Well, I heard some guys talking.

228
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,269
Well, no luck back there either.

229
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,913
Well, I can still take
the honourable way out.

230
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,315
I'm going home to burn my feet
on the radiator.

231
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,152
No, no, Carla.
Carla, come here. Come here.

232
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,914
Wait. Let's see if we can...

233
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,514
...do something here.

234
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,916
Sammy.

235
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,796
You're graceful.

236
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,158
Carla.

237
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,550
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,553
- Cheryl, is that you?
- Yeah.

239
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,229
We never liked each other
very much.

240
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,435
Hey.

241
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,914
What are you doing here with Sam?

242
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,877
I thought you were coming
with Eddie Csznyk.

243
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,594
Sam happens to be
a much better dancer.

244
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,910
And he has the grace of a swan.

245
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,229
Bull swan.

246
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,790
Hi, kids.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,877
That's the way he started
every show.

248
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,475
That's catchy.

249
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,000
A lot of great years,
and a lot of great music,

250
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,311
and a lot of grey hairs
have gone by.

251
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,636
But you know what?
Out of all the music,

252
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,597
I think our music
was the best music.

253
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,796
- What do you say?
- You're a lame-o!

254
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,794
Oh, you kids. Spunky as ever.

255
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,515
But we're gonna have
a lot of fun tonight.

256
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,999
Hey, I got an idea.

257
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,469
Why don't we see
how far we've all come

258
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,995
since the old Boston Boppers days?

259
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,310
Tell us the person
you most admired then

260
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,072
and the person
you most admire now.

261
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,553
I'm Cheryl Koski from Brockton.

262
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,757
And back then, I guess the person
I admired the most

263
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,990
was Frankie Avalon.

264
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,038
- And now?
- Now I'd have to say...

265
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,111
...Fabian.

266
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,158
All right.

267
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,878
All right.

268
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,076
Now that you're warmed up,

269
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,589
Iet's get down to what
you're all here for:

270
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,070
a chance to dance your way
to Waikiki.

271
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,348
The rules are simple.

272
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,397
If the judges tap you, you're out.

273
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,239
You know, Sammy,

274
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,755
when Nick and I used to go
to these dance contests,

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,151
we always used to spit
on each other's shoes for good luck.

276
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,998
Well?

277
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,356
You missed.

278
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,155
I hope you dance
better than you spit.

279
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,838
Here we go with "Tutti-Frutti."

280
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,273
Well, I'm sorry, kids. You're out.

281
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,879
- Oh, come on, man!
- Hey, you stupid...

282
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,635
Hey, they suck swamp water too.

283
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,519
We have our winners!

284
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,990
Hold it a minute, Floyd.

285
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,834
A great wrong is about to be done.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,877
You know me. I'm Nick Tortelli.

287
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,828
High school class of '62, '63, '64.

288
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,118
The reason I didn't win this contest
is because my partner stunk.

289
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,588
And I refuse to leave
until I show you how it's done

290
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,194
with my ex-lovely wife, Carla.

291
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,752
Nicky.

292
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,952
- Come on, Carla.
- Forget it, Nick.

293
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,436
Floyd, "Unchained Melody."

294
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,078
Well, guess it's just you and me.

295
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,792
Beg your pardon?

296
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,312
I'd like to do something with you
that'll make him sorry.

297
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,835
And I don't mean dancing.

298
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,195
Do you have a van?

299
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,752
I don't really think you wanna do
something you're gonna regret later.

300
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,388
Oh, yes, I do.
And I wanna do it right now.

301
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,471
And I'm good too.

302
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,837
Even though I don't like it very much.

303
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,751
You're making too big
a deal out of this.

304
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,871
I mean, it's just a dance.

305
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,111
How good?

306
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,874
Introducing the winner of
The Boston Boppers dance contest,

307
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,519
Miss Carla Tortelli!

308
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,790
Oh, yay! That's wonderful.

309
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,599
- You two did it.
- Well, no, no.

310
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,797
Actually, Carla and Nick won.

311
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,520
I guess I just wasn't
graceful enough.

312
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,672
Come on, Sammy.
You were plenty graceful.

313
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,836
No, I wasn't.

314
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,190
No, really. You should've seen
Carla and Nick out there.

315
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,316
They were like Fred and Ethel.
Really.

316
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,870
Yeah, it was a magical moment.

317
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,679
You know, it was like
I was transported back in time.

318
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,678
I wasn't a tired old woman
with six kids.

319
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,196
I was a fresh young teenager
with two kids.

320
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,672
Come on, you guys.
Let me drive you home.

321
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,114
Oh, good.

322
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,470
Sammy, I think I just wanna
sit here for a little while

323
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,153
and bask in the glow.

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,715
Relive the moment
and have a couple of belts.

325
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,518
Yeah, enjoy.

326
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,954
Thanks.

327
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,156
Congratulations, Carla.

328
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,878
Now, aren't you glad you went?

329
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,230
I'll bet you looked great
out there on the dance floor.

330
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,469
Yeah, I did, actually.

331
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,996
You know, why don't you come by my
place, and I'll show you my Watusi?

332
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,072
And then later on,
we can dance a little bit.

333
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,152
On second thought,
I'm going to hitchhike.

334
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,719
You meet a better class of people.

335
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,599
My love, my darling

336
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,512
I hunger for your touch

337
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,310
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

338
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,832
Carla...

339
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,958
...tonight...

340
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,111
...was destiny.

341
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,110
What are you talking about?

342
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,352
It was destiny that Eddie Csznyk
fell down those stairs.

343
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,798
And it was destiny that The Boppers
even had a reunion.

344
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,473
And it was destiny
that we won the contest.

345
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,474
When we were dancing
out on that floor tonight,

346
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,392
we were like the only two
people on earth.

347
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,596
I know we belong together,
and we always will.

348
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,189
Come on, Nick.

349
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,998
We're great when we're
on the dance floor,

350
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,310
but when the music stops,
we stink on ice.

351
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,119
No, no. We were meant
to be together.

352
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,556
Carla, you know me.

353
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,672
Look in my eyes and you'll know
I'll tell you the truth.

354
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,792
- You're serious.
- Yeah.

355
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,269
What are you saying?

356
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,994
I'm saying I want you to go
to Hawaii with me tonight.

357
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,759
Now.

358
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,909
Please, Carla.

359
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,311
Make this dream of mine come true.

360
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,076
- Tonight was incredible.
- Yeah.

361
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
- Wow, you and me in Hawaii.
- Yeah.

362
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,955
- Palm trees.
- Palm trees.

363
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,111
- Sipping mai tais on the beach.
- Yeah, mai tais.

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,150
- lt'd be paradise.
- Yeah.

365
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,079
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

366
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,798
- What about Loretta?
- What about her?

367
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,678
She's waiting for us at the airport.

368
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,396
Is that a no?
