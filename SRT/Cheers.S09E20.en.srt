00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,200
                    What are you
             doing, Cliff? What?

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Well, I'm, uh, leaving          
a tip there for Carla.          

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
                    Yeah?       

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, one of the oldest         
bar tricks                      

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,100
in the book there, Normie.      

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,700
Look, you see I filled          
the glass with water.           

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm gonna invert it on top      
of this dollar bill.            

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Put it on the bar, right?       

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
Looks... Looks, uh,             
empty now, doesn't it?          

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,400
                         Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Well, watch what happens        
when she comes to get her tip.  

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,100
     Fasten your seat belts     
 and wait for the fun to begin. 

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
    Oh.                         

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Thanks for the tip, Cliff.      

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,700
Uh, joke's still                
on her.                         

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,500
She's the one that's got        
to mop up all this mess.        

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,500
            (laughs)            

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,100
Thank you, Carla.               

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,100
Your apology's                  
accepted.                       

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,500
      (theme song begins)       

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,900
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,100
 Takes everything you've got  

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,800
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,200
 Sure would help a lot         

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,700
   Sometimes you want to go    

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,100
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,900
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,200
       You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name    

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,400
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,600
   People are all the same     

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,300
       You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,900
        Hey, guys.              

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
                      Hey, Wood.
            Hi, Wood.           

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,900
      Mom finally sent out      

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,700
 Grandma Meg's pressure cooker, 

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,200
so last night I whipped up      
    a batch of chili.           

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,700
                    Oh.         
    Do you want                 
    to try some?                

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,900
            Yeah.               
Sure.                           

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
    It's from an old            
    family recipe.              

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,600
                    Oh, your    
                    grandma's?  

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,800
      Nah, this old family      
that lived down the road.       

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,300
    Mmm!                        

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
         Woody, this is         
        excellent!              

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,700
    Mmm!                        
                    Mmm!        

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
                    Normie, what
                do you think?   

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
                    (belches)   

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,900
                    He likes it!

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,900
                Normie likes it!

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Woody, I'm sorry. It seems      
we've eaten all your chili.     

55
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,800
I still got plenty left         
in the thermos.                 
                          Great.

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,700
 I didn't have breakfast today, 
        all right?              

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,500
         (door opening)         

58
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,300
         Quick, Normie,         
  turn on the Weather Channel.  

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,200
              You know, I wonder

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,600
            if that sentence has
        ever been spoken before.

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,200
      (female voice on TV)      

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, yeah, there she is.         

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,800
    Who?                        

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,300
      Weathergirl Dorothy,      
          my favorite.          

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,700
    Isn't she dreamy?           

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Cliff, everybody                
looks sort of dreamy            

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
when they have giant clouds     
floating behind them.           

68
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,600
            No, no.             
        Listen, listen.         

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,100
      She's got the cutest      
      little lateral lisp.      

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,100
Oh, I always get a giggle       
 when she tries to pronounce... 

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,300
        (lisping):              
    ...stratocumulus.           

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,000
So you, uh... you watch this    
a lot, do you?                  

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,100
      Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.      

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
          You get, uh,          
kind of a fatherly feeling      

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
about these, uh, weather anchors
         after a while.         

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,900
      Yeah, well, besides,      
    it's on all night.          

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,500
            You're a very lonely
         man, aren't you, Cliff?

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,800
          Not as long           
  as I got my Weather Channel.  

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
        Hey, guys.              

80
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,700
Hey, Sammy's back!              
    (all shouting greetings)    

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
                    Hey, how was
                    your weekend

82
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,600
             up in the mountains
                with Natalie?   

83
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,900
        It was so great.        

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Nothin' like shushing down      
    those fine white slopes.    

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,100
                        NORM:   
                        Yeah.   

86
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,200
                    Oh, you went
                    skiing, huh?

87
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
No, no, no.                     

88
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,900
            You're a dog!       

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
              Oh!               

90
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,600
Goodie. Sam, you're back.       

91
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
Hey, that's                     
what Natalie said.              

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
No, actually,                   
actually, she said,             

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,100
"Oh, goodie, Sam, your front."  

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,300
        (laughter)              

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,900
             I have a very, very
    special surprise for you,   

96
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,000
              so just close your
          eyes and come with me.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
    This is deja vu of          
    the whole weekend.          

98
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
FRASIER:                        
Oh!                             

99
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,900
                Okay, you can   
                 open your eyes.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
        (chuckling):            
        Okay.                   

101
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,800
             Well?              

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
I can't tell you                

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,100
how much better                 
Natalie's surprise was.         

104
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,100
                    What, you   
                  don't like it?

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,700
          Well, it...           
    It's-It's just...           

106
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,000
                    Boy.        

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
            I mean, it's-it's   
                    really...   

108
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,400
                    Boy.        

109
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,800
                No, that's...   
                that's not...   

110
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,200
                  That's not the
                     right word.

111
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,500
                        It's not
                     boy at all.

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,000
             It's, um... It's...

113
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,200
        It's a tearoom.         

114
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Thanks for not making me guess. 

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, so what-what do you think?

116
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,400
     Well, you want my, uh,     
    honest first impression?    

117
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,600
        My gut reaction?        

118
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,200
        Yes, I do.              

119
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
     I hate it. I hate it.      

120
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,500
        I hate it!              

121
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
            Now how could you   

122
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,300
        do this without         
        asking me first?        

123
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,900
Without asking you first?       

124
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,700
Wait a minute! I happen to have 
paid $25,000 to John Hill       

125
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,100
to get this poolroom back.      

126
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,500
If it hadn't been for me,       

127
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,100
you wouldn't even have          
this poolroom!                  

128
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,200
    I don't have a poolroom.    

129
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,500
    I have a tearoom.           

130
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,700
              Ish!              

131
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,900
          Oh, oh, oh.           

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
                Look what you   
                     made me do.

133
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,700
                     You made me
                      say "ish."

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
                        (scoffs)

135
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
What's that on the floor?       

136
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,500
It's a throw rug.               

137
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,700
              Oh.               

138
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,200
                        Oh, hey.

139
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
                Look at that.   
                    It works.   

140
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,000
        Wait.                   

141
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,700
         This wouldn't happen to
     be a throw table, would it?

142
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,500
         No. Sam, wait!         

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
You know, if you're gonna       
take my money,                  

144
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,100
I think my ideas deserve        
a little bit more respect.      

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
                All right.      

146
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,900
You're right.                   
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.           

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,900
Uh, this just came              
as a little bit                 

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
of a shock to me,               
that's all.                     

149
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,200
Tell you what, why don't I,     
uh, just, uh, go outside here   

150
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,900
and come back in                
and start fresh?                

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,900
    That would be good, Sam.    
        Thank you.              

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
 I hate it. Hate it. <i>I hate it!</i> 

153
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,600
              Ish!              

154
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,800
        I'm putting that room   
            back the way it was!

155
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,200
As soon as I find               
my pool table.                  

156
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,600
                          CLIFF:
                     Three ball,
                  corner pocket.

157
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
                    Thanks, Sam.

158
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
            A little too much   
                English on that.

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
                        REBECCA:
                            Sam,

160
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,600
please, now I know... I know    
I sprung this on you, but       

161
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,600
please give it a chance.        

162
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,900
                      I think it
                     could work.

163
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,100
My marketing survey showed      

164
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,600
that this neighborhood was      
in need of something like this. 

165
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,300
            People want to go   
                to a place where
            they can just relax.

166
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
You know, a nice,               
quiet, pretty little place      

167
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
where they can                  
just sit and talk.              

168
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,500
                    (belches)   

169
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,100
                Good one.       

170
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
      Honey, you're crazy.      
 I-I have people coming in here 

171
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,900
 just to shoot stick. I mean, I 
bet that poolroom makes me      

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,100
        an extra hundred        
         bucks a night.         
                     Yeah, well,

173
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,600
     I bet with my tearoom,     
I could make 500 bucks tonight. 

174
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
        500 bucks               
         in one night?          
                            Yes.

175
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,400
What else are you selling       
          back there?           

176
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,700
     Sam, it's my grand opening.

177
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
             I've been promoting
                  all over town.

178
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,900
You make 500 bucks in one night,
 and-and that tearoom is yours. 

179
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,100
          It's a bet.           

180
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,300
            Okay, it's a bet.   
(chuckles)                      

181
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
          But I want you to know
          there's no losers here

182
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,400
         because I'm gonna share
    half the profit with you.   

183
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,000
          Oh ho! Ooh!           

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
        Half the profits        
         of a tearoom!          

185
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,200
              Oh!               

186
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,100
            Oh, boy,            
 why didn't you say so before?  

187
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,600
Let's figure                    
this out here.                  

188
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
All right, let's see.           
We'll, uh,                      

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,700
    start with your profits.    

190
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,500
    That'd be... ooh!           

191
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,800
Wait, wait, wait.               
Now I get half of this.         

192
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
          (muttering):          
         Let me. Hmm...         

193
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,400
      Ooh, another... ooh!      

194
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
     Fellas, fellas, look.      

195
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,600
I get a great                   
big zero,                       

196
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,300
and I don't have                
to lift a finger!               

197
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,800
Oh, thank you,                  
thank you.                      

198
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,200
              I can retire! Ooh!

199
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
God, he's a butthead.           

200
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
            DOROTHY:            
     Now, let's take a look     
      at the regional map.      

201
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,900
        (lisping):              
      The southern sectors      
will experience scattered clouds

202
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,000
  over the Mississippi Basin.   

203
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,600
              Boy.              

204
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,700
        (chuckles)              

205
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
                  Don't you just
            love how she says   

206
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
                      (lisping):
            "Mississippi Basin"?

207
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,800
              It just melts your
         heart, doesn't it, huh?

208
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,900
                  Mm-hmm.       

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,600
        You know, I, uh,        
sent a fan letter to my Dorothy.

210
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,900
                            Hmm?

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
         Yeah, I wonder         
  if she'll ever even read it.  

212
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,400
            I mean,             
  they must get so many. Hmm.   

213
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,300
            You know, I don't   
                think so, Cliff.

214
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,000
              I don't think that
            many people watch   
            the Weather Channel.

215
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,400
                      Seriously,
                I don't think   

216
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,600
        that many people know   
     there <i>is</i> a Weather Channel.

217
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
        Hmm. Boy, Norm,         
     are you out of touch!      

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,700
              Hey, Fras, Lilith.

219
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,800
        Get you a drink?        

220
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,300
        No, Sam, we are not here
          for libation this day.

221
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,900
    We are here for the grand   
opening of Rebecca's tearoom.   

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,400
                 Oh, yeah? Yeah?

223
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 What, you gonna go back there  
and, uh, make fun of her?       

224
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,400
No, we're-we're going           
to go have some tea.            

225
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,900
        Oh, yeah, yeah,         
     then you're, what...?      

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
      You're gonna spit it      
 on the floor and laugh at her? 

227
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,300
We're just going to order it    
and drink it down.              

228
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,000
 Well, what's funny about that? 

229
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,900
We're not trying                
to be funny.                    

230
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,100
We're just here for some tea.   

231
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Is that so hard to believe?     

232
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,800
        Yeah, seein' how        
    she's been open all day,    

233
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,200
and you're the first customers. 
        (chuckles)              

234
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,600
        Oh, well, maybe the word
          hasn't gotten out yet.

235
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,100
          Although, she did send
    us this lovely invitation   

236
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,600
            hand-calligraphed   
                on a lace doily.

237
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,600
              Didn't anyone else
            get one of these?   

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
                     Very funny.

239
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,500
        Could have put someone's
              eye out, you know.

240
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,600
              Let's go, Frasier.

241
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,000
Wait, wait,                     
wait, Fras.                     

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
You're not really               
gonna go in there               

243
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,400
and drink tea,                  
are ya?                         

244
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,800
Come on out here                
and sit at the bar,             

245
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,800
you know,                       
with the guys.                  

246
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,800
Have a beer.                    
            Yeah.               

247
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,300
Well, I guess I-I could.        

248
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,700
                 (clears throat)

249
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,900
              No.               

250
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,500
I mean, you're-you're tellin' us
you're just gonna go back there 

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,300
     and sit with your wife     
    and sip tea, huh?           

252
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,500
        Yup, that's me.         

253
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,200
Whipped and proud of it.        

254
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Thank you.                      

255
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,800
         Here you are.          

256
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,800
        Please allow me.        

257
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
    All right, there.           

258
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
 Now you'll notice on the menu  

259
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
    that we have a...           
 a wide selection of sandwiches 

260
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,300
    and delectables, and, uh,   
many, many varieties of tea.    

261
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,100
    So, what can I get you?     

262
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
     Just some tea, please.     

263
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,200
      That's it? Just tea?      

264
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,500
         Well, perhaps          
    I could tempt you           

265
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,700
         with some tiny         
      little sandwiches or      

266
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
        fresh biscuits?         

267
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,600
            Scones?             

268
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
 We're both watching our diets, 

269
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,400
  so two pots of Orange Pekoe   
        would be lovely.        

270
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,600
FRASIER:                        
Hon,                            

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,700
  maybe we should split a pot.  

272
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,300
            Well...             

273
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,700
 Per-Perhaps one of my slightly 
  more expensive herbal teas?   

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Uh, no, thank you.              

275
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,100
 You guys cannot just have tea. 

276
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,300
                        Tea is a
                    loss leader.

277
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,500
          I lose money          
    just boiling the water.     

278
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
    And, Lilith, look.          

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,100
      (blows through lips)      

280
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,300
      You are hardly fat.       

281
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
  You are borderline anorexic.  

282
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Just                            

283
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
            pig out!            

284
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
  Order some strawberry tarts.  

285
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,600
Strawberries make me break out. 

286
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,400
  Well, at least that will put  
  a little color in your face.  

287
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
        Perhaps we won't have   
                anything at all.

288
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,000
             Fine!              

289
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
 I don't really care. Get out!  

290
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
              Thanks for coming.
          Tell all your friends.

291
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,400
                Frasier, Lilith,
                  oh, I'm sorry.

292
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,400
                  I'm sorry. I'm
                 just desperate.

293
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
    I don't understand          
        why nobody wants        

294
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,100
            to come back into my
              beautiful tearoom.

295
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,100
Well, Rebecca,                  

296
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,100
a restaurant should be...       

297
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,100
like a mistress.                

298
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
You see,                        

299
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
one shouldn't feel that         
she's overeager to please.      

300
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
It's far more enticing          

301
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
if you need her more            
than she needs you.             

302
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
            Who is this "she"   

303
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
                  you're talking
                 about, Frasier?

304
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Purely hypothetical.            

305
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,900
                    Well, it's a
                  little strange

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,700
                for a happily   
                     married man

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
              to go prattling on
            about a mistress.   

308
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, come on, hon,               
give me this one.               

309
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,500
You already heard me            
admit I was whipped             

310
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,700
in front of the boys.           

311
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
             That was good.     

312
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,900
You were right, Sam.            

313
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,200
Nobody's gonna come             
in here                         

314
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
and have high tea               
and crumpets.                   

315
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,500
                  Oh, don't give
                        up hope.

316
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
(Cockney accent):               
Maybe a carriage                
will break down                 

317
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,700
in front of the pub             
and everyone'll come            
in for a cup of tea.            

318
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,100
Have a cup of                   
tea, please.                    

319
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Have a cup of tea.              
                God, I hate you!

320
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
          Okay, guys.           

321
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,100
 Just made up a fresh new batch 
        of chili.               

322
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,100
(cheering)                      

323
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
                Now all I ask   

324
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,500
         is you please          
    leave me some this time.    

325
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,300
            You guys really like
          that chili, don't you?
  Mmm.                          

326
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,800
                    Well, do you
                      think that

327
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
          if I sold that kind of
    chili in my tearoom that,   

328
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,700
                uh, I could make
                $500 a night?   

329
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,400
Easy. But, uh,                  

330
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
why would anyone want           
to go back there?               

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
We got a free pot               
of chili right here.            

332
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,700
                Good point.     

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,800
     Chili in the tearoom!      

334
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,300
        Chili in the tearoom!   

335
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Sammy, kiss that poolroom       
         good-bye, pal.         

336
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,700
Sam, she's sellin' an awful     
lotta chili in there.           

337
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
She must be gettin'             
pretty close                    

338
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
to that $500 mark.              
                    Oh, come on.

339
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,900
              So she's sellin' a
                couple of bowls.

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,900
          I mean, how much chili
                  can a guy eat?

341
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,100
    Boy, I can't eat another    
        mouthful.               

342
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
                     Uh-huh, see
                    what I mean?

343
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,700
Thank goodness they sell        
these gallon buckets            

344
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
    for take-out.               

345
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
            Oh, man,            

346
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,900
                  I'm gonna lose
                    my poolroom.

347
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
        I've gotta think of some
                way to stop her.

348
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I agree with you,               
Sammy.                          

349
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
Go for the jugular.             

350
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,900
                 Oh, yeah, yeah.

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,300
            Whatta ya mean, like
                sabotage her?   

352
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
No, go for her jugular.         

353
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,600
I mean, you can't               
sell chili                      

354
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,700
when her throat's               
all ripped out.                 

355
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,700
Well, she could,                
but who'd wanna buy it?         

356
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,700
                No, I got it,   
                    I got it.   

357
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
             Let's call the fire
            marshal on her, huh?

358
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
                 No, no, no, no,
                     no, no, no,

359
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,100
                 that'd be below
                    the belt.   

360
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,600
                I can't do that.

361
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
Sam, can I talk to you a minute?

362
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,700
                     You know, I
                just realized   

363
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,700
             that the closer I'm
             getting to my goal,

364
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,700
    the more all I'm thinking   
            about is winning,   

365
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,100
        and that's not right.   

366
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,800
        I mean, I wasn't even   
      considering your feelings.

367
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,000
        You've had that poolroom
            for many, many years

368
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,200
         and, well, I guess what
         I'm trying to say is...

369
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,500
          (singsongy):          
      Ha-ha-ha-ha, <i>ha-ha!</i>       

370
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,900
                I'm gonna win   
                  your poolroom!

371
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,900
     Call the fire marshal!     

372
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
 Glad that dinner rush is over. 

373
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,300
                 Give me time to
                put up a new pot

374
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,700
        before the after-theatre
                crowd gets here.

375
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
                 Sam, I'm takin'
                        a break.

376
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,000
Me, too, Sammy.                 

377
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm down to the last notch      
on my belt.                     

378
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,500
        Yeah, I had to make a   
            new one with a nail.

379
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,600
 Hey, Cliff, you got somethin'  
          in the mail.          

380
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,300
    Huh?                        
That reminds me.                

381
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,800
  Did I ever take you out back  

382
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,100
  and kick the hell out of you  
for that postal increase?       

383
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
    Uh-huh.                     

384
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,200
             Good.              

385
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,100
 Just goin' over my checklist.  

386
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,300
        Well, look at this!     

387
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,900
        It's a reply from my    
        Weathergirl Dorothy.    

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, look at that,               
the sweetheart.                 

389
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
She sent a little photo         
of herself.                     

390
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
            No, no, no, Cliffie,

391
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,600
                I believe that's
            a satellite photo   

392
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,600
                of the entire   
            Eastern Seaboard.   

393
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh, yeah,                       
but she's in there.             

394
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,600
I mean, I'm in there.           

395
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,200
We're all in there.             

396
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,500
                The letter says,
                    "Dear Cliff,

397
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
          "Thank you so much for
              your sweet letter.

398
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
            "You did not mention
        what grade you're in,   

399
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
    "but from the handwriting   
                         I guess

400
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,100
              "that you're a big
                boy of 11 or 12.

401
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
                 "Maybe when you
                        grow up,

402
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,500
                "you can be a   
             weatherperson, too.

403
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,300
                    Yours truly,
                Dorothy Borsik."

404
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,500
            CARLA (whispers):   
                      Sammy, the
                fire marshal.   

405
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,900
Sam,                            

406
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
        we got a tip that Cheers
          is operating a kitchen

407
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,700
            without a permit.   

408
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,700
            Anything to that?   

409
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
          Oh, gosh no.          

410
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
  I don't think anything that   
  would concern you, you know,  

411
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
         just a couple          
of exposed propane tanks,       

412
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,700
                    unventilated
                      hot plate.

413
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
      I mean, but that...       
     oh, now wait a second.     

414
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,600
         Gee, that's a,         
that's a potential fire hazard. 

415
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,600
And you, you're a fire marshal. 

416
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,200
      What was I thinking?      

417
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,800
            I think I'll just   
                take a look-see.

418
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Maybe I shouldn't have called   
            the fire department.

419
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,200
        Maybe that was wrong.   

420
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
Don't chicken out               
now, Sam.                       

421
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,500
                     No, no, no,
              maybe I shoulda...

422
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,800
              put a mouse in the
            chili and called the
              health department.

423
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,200
                 That would have
                been funnier.   

424
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
        (laughing)              

425
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,600
              Sam,              

426
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
you should                      

427
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,900
    be ashamed of yourself.     

428
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Do you realize                  

429
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
  everything that Rebecca has   
     attempted in her life      

430
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,000
    has resulted in failure?    

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,700
             Yeah.              

432
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,200
This is her first               

433
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,700
success, and you're trying      
to take it away from her.       

434
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
      That's my poolroom!       

435
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,400
    But it's her life.          

436
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,600
     But it's my poolroom.      

437
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,000
 Come on, you guys, understand  
        that, don't ya?         

438
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,000
                Yeah, Sam, we   
                     understand.

439
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,600
We understand you made a fair   
        bet, you saw that you   

440
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
                were gonna lose,
    and you started cheatin'.   

441
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Well, I-I-I didn't want         
to be a bad sport.              

442
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,600
I just wanted to do anything    
I had to to win.                

443
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,600
But that's no reason            
for you to be a cheater.        

444
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,800
            But you were the one
        who told me to cheat!   

445
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,000
No, I said                      
to kill her.                    

446
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,500
Cheating's wrong.               

447
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,500
        I'm, I'm sorry.         

448
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,700
 What, do you all hate me now?  
          Is that...?           

449
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,500
    Well, kinda, yeah.          

450
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,800
          I'm afraid that's some
                list, Miss Howe.

451
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
                        NORM:   
                          Great,

452
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
    now he's writin' her up     
          a citation.           

453
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
                  So it's beans,
                tomato paste,   

454
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,200
                 onions, peppers
                and ground beef.

455
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
No, that's ground chuck.        

456
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,900
            Oh, ground chuck.   

457
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
                Serves eight?   
Uh-huh.                         

458
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,900
What're you gonna do,           
share with the other guys       

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
at the firehouse?               
                Why should I?   

460
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
             What have they ever
                    done for me?

461
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,900
        Sam,                    

462
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,500
why do you suppose              

463
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
          the fire marshal would
        come by my chili room   

464
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,200
                     tonight, of
                     all nights?

465
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,500
            Kismet?             

466
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,800
                 No, because you
                 tipped him off.

467
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,100
Sam, you could've               
gotten me shut down.            

468
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,800
             Thank God that dear
            man loves his chili.

469
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
        I'm sorry.              

470
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,100
             I got carried away.

471
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,300
            Yes, you did.       

472
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,300
              Listen, I, I gotta
            make this up to you.

473
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,800
              How, how, how, how
                close are you   

474
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,600
        to getting that $500?   

475
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,700
                      About $20.

476
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,600
             I'll tell you what.

477
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,800
             Let me, let me, uh,

478
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,500
                buy a bowl of   
                  chili for $20.
No.                             

479
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,000
              No, Sam, you don't
                need to do that.

480
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, listen, I wanna prove to you
that I'm not a poor loser.      

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,100
                Come on, give me

482
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,800
     my bowl of chili here.     

483
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,300
        Thank you, Sam,         
      this is nice of you.      

484
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,500
Go ahead,                       
just put on Woody's hat         

485
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,700
and get the chili yourself      

486
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,700
because I want to get           
my camera and get a picture     

487
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,000
of you pouring                  
that bowl                       

488
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,600
      of chili that put me      
         over the top.          

489
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,100
Oh, you got                     
to warm it up, Sam.             

490
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
You know how to                 
turn on the flame?              

491
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
It's kind of tricky.            

492
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
                      Yeah, I'll
                  figure it out.

493
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
                (loud explosion)

494
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
            Yep, that's how I   
            figured it out, too.

495
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,300
    It was a accident.          

496
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,300
Sammy, are you okay?            

497
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
You ever had a pot of chili fly 
          by your face          

498
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
     at the speed of light?     

499
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
        No.                     

500
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,400
             Don't.             

501
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,300
                Look at the hole
                in that wall.   

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,800
      Who could miss it, huh?   

503
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,000
No, I'm talking                 
about the brick wall            

504
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,600
            across the alley.   

505
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,900
    Man, that pressure cooker   
      really wanted out of here.

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,900
Okay, everybody                 
out of here, out.               

507
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,400
Come on,                        
everybody, out!                 

508
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,900
Go back to the bar,             
please.                         

509
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,200
            Not you.            

510
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,700
I want to talk to you.          

511
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,500
  Don't you think maybe I should
    go to a trauma center first?

512
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
                  S-Some of this
                    could be me.

513
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,800
        Oh, come on, I know what
        you're thinking here,   

514
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,800
    but I-I didn't do           
        this on purpose.        

515
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,700
    I swear to God I didn't     
    do it on purpose.           

516
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,200
    You did it just because     
  I started doing really well   

517
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
 back here and you're jealous.  

518
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,200
Y-You're just a big baby.       

519
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,000
        I am not.               
                Yes, you are.   

520
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,500
  You want everything for you   
      and nothing for me.       

521
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,400
  Well, yeah, if that's being   
    a big baby, okay,           

522
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
    but... but I'm a,           

523
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,100
I'm a guy.                      

524
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm supposed                    
to be a big baby.               

525
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
      And you're a woman.       

526
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
You know, you're supposed       
to be like a nice mommy         

527
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,200
and tell me everything's okay   
and, and pat me on the head.    

528
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,900
         I would like to pat you
      on the head with a pickax.

529
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,300
Oh, I, I know how you feel.     

530
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,300
            I mean,             

531
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm sorry.                      

532
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
             This is crazy, I...

533
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,300
        I feel so sorry.        

534
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
         No, you don't.         

535
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,200
    Yes, I do, I really do.     

536
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,300
     I just feel terrible.      

537
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,700
  I... feel like I could cry.   

538
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,600
             Okay.              

539
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,000
        Okay what?              

540
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,800
                Cry.            

541
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,100
What do you mean?               

542
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,800
    I mean, make water come     
    out of your eyes.           

543
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
    And that way I will know    
that you are really sorry       

544
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,200
for what you've done here.      

545
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,900
         Just cry?              

546
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,600
                Yep.            

547
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
Does it count if, you know,     

548
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,400
if you really want to cry,      
but you can't?                  

549
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
                 No.            

550
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,800
              Cry, Sam.         

551
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
        Huh.                    

552
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,900
(mock sobbing)                  

553
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,300
                      No onions.

554
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,000
        I want real tears.      
             Now, just cry.     

555
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
Give me a break.                
What am I supposed to--?        

556
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
      I mean, isn't this enough?

557
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
                    A guy, a guy
                  who can't cry?

558
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,700
                 I mean, that is
                  heartbreaking.

559
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Honey, there's nothing sadder   
than a man who can't cry.       

560
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,500
                        No, Sam.

561
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,700
         It is not enough.      

562
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,500
            Wait, maybe I can   
              help you out here.

563
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,100
                (glass breaking)

564
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
                      (footsteps
                    approaching)

565
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
             There.             

566
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,800
         Now we can go.         

567
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,100
            Come on.            

568
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,100
            What was that sound?

569
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,300
Oh, that was the sound          

570
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,700
of me breaking all the windows  
out of your Corvette.           

571
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,500
         (Sam sobbing)          

572
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
REBECCA:                        
There, now there                
are those tears.
