1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,717
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,838
Okay, Mr Peterson, it's your turn

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
to send a tape-recorded hello
to my folks back home.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,638
I don't know what
to say here, Woody.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,870
Just hurry it up, will you.
I've got some audio gems

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,759
that'll have them howling
in the old Hoosier state.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,112
Okay, just let me find the end
of Miss Chambers' message here.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,508
Alrighty.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,069
Your son is
a hardworking young man.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,674
You should be proud.
We at Cheers certainly are.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,512
And what's more--

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,996
I think it's a little further along here.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,076
I believe it was Elizabeth
Barrett Browning who said--

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,594
Now let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,911
All right, fill me up, Woody.
I think we're in here for a while.

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,671
Okeydokey, Mr Peterson, found
the end of Miss Chambers' message.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,512
It's ready to go.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,272
Hi, folks. This is Norm.

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,514
Oh, no, that's the end of the tape.

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,716
Sorry you didn't get
to leave your whole message.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,916
That was the whole message.

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,111
Oh, thanks.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,192
Sam, two Beefeater martinis, please.

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,918
Well, you're just
bubbling with energy.

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,995
You must've mastered the childproof
cap on your Flintstones vitamins.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,592
That's pretty cute, Diane.

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,911
Scored again.

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,235
Yeah, I guess
I'll be saying that a lot tonight.

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,916
You got an evening
of romance planned, Sam?

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,718
Yeah, I sure do.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,316
Who's the bimbo du jour?

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,192
That's the girl, all right.

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,750
Claudia's been a tough nut to crack.

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,673
But tonight's the night
she's gonna be enjoying

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,469
all the rides in
Sammy's magic kingdom.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,430
She's in for a Mickey Mouse
evening with Goofy as her guide.

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,149
Boy, Sam, I wish I could
read women like you.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,039
I mean, I can never really
tell when a woman likes me.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,358
Well, Woody, women give off
different subtle signs of interest.

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,752
Me, I stand there naked
with a rose in my teeth.

41
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,475
I'll watch for that one.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,108
So, Sam, what signal
is your date giving you?

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,033
Not only is Claudia
mentally undressing me,

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,834
she's mentally fixing me
breakfast the next morning.

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,475
I'm sorry this is taking so long here.
I hope you're not getting bored.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,358
Oh, no. I enjoy watching you work.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,559
I'm glad to hear that. I've got some
mirrors at home. We can both watch.

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,517
One second. Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact he is.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,797
Hold on one second, will you.
Cliffie, telephone.

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,952
Somebody wants to talk to Cliff?

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,510
Cliffie. This is a first, bud. I don't think
anyone's ever called you here before.

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,319
Yeah, I know who this is.
It's a tootsie on my route

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,916
who's been eyeing the cut of my jib
through her Levolors.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,073
Her old man's probably out of town,
she's looking for a little C.O.D.:

55
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,596
Cliffie on demand.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,151
I know how to handle this babe.

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,992
Hello.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,072
Listen, I never wanna speak to you
again as long as I live. Goodbye.

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,232
- Who was that?
- That was a man

60
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,868
who has the nerve
to call himself my father.

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,073
He'd have to have nerve
to admit that.

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,396
Are you still carrying a grudge?

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,437
Damn straight.

64
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,076
How would you feel if your father
deserted you at the formative age of 9?

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,630
Cliff, don't you at least wanna
hear what he has to say?

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,917
- Perhaps he's trying to make amends.
- No way.

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,555
I don't wanna have anything
to do with that bum.

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,393
Well, I know how these
father/son relationships can be.

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,154
My dad didn't want me
to get serious with Vera.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,669
- He heard she had loose morals.
- You're kidding me.

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,156
Actually, he got the story wrong.
Turns out she had loose molars.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,998
At least you had
a father figure, Norm.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,557
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well.

74
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,519
- Sam.
- Five minutes, we'll be out of here.

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,359
What's this? A date of yours
reading Artforum magazine.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,315
And it's right side up too.

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,348
Hope this doesn't mean that we're
gonna have to talk afterwards.

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,669
Why do I keep trying
to communicate with you?

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,553
It must be
the Margaret Mead in me.

80
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,832
That's a wonderful issue.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,230
Yes, it is.

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,554
Did you happen to read their article
on Chinese tapestries?

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,359
- Yes, it was fascinating.
- Wasn't it?

84
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,071
Yeah, the only problem was that 20
minutes later, I wanted to read it again.

85
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,391
Reads and has a sense of humour.

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,073
Did you lose a bet?

87
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,793
Excuse me?

88
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,868
- I'm Diane Chambers.
- Claudia Mitchell.

89
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,517
So you and Sam are going out?

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,156
Yes, we're gonna try that
new lndian restaurant, Rajah's.

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,989
Oh, I understand their chef
is a master of tandoori cooking.

92
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,033
Well, I don't really know
that much about lndian food.

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,714
It's the one area where I'm not
really able to be pretentious.

94
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,309
Well, I am, so we have
the bases covered.

95
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,514
- Mind if I sit down?
- Please.

96
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,830
Oh, yeah, and after all,
the game of billiards

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,958
was invented by the ancient
Phoenicians, Norm.

98
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,554
Well, however, it did gain
newfound popularity

99
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,633
after a group of
Benedictine monks invented felt.

100
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,919
Thank you, Sam.

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,717
Good Lord.

102
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,110
I think that's my father.

103
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,716
There's still time to slip out
the bathroom window.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,072
No, no, no. I wanna hear what the rat
has to say. Don't let out who I am.

105
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,112
- Can I help you?
- Do you happen to know Cliff Clavin?

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,597
I...

107
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,558
I...

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,788
Sam, I'm no good under pressure.

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,079
- Hi, I'm Sam Malone. I'm the owner.
- Oh, hi. I'm Cliff Sr, his father.

110
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,879
I called his ma, she said he hangs
out here sometimes. Is he around?

111
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,675
Well, no. Actually he's not.
I think he's away on business.

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,149
- Yeah.
- Too bad. I wanted to talk to him.

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,319
It's funny. My own son. I don't even
know what he does for a living.

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,959
I don't even know
what he looks like.

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,758
Cliff might be away for a while here.

116
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,832
Is there any message
you'd like me to give to him?

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,999
I'll hang around a while. It's kind of
personal. I'd like to deliver it myself.

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,156
- Oh, yeah, here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

119
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,478
Excuse me.

120
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,432
I got something to say.

121
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,239
Could I have the sports page?

122
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,193
Oh, yeah, sure. Here you are.

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,400
Boy, you two seem to be
getting along.

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,156
- Are you ready?
- Oh, not to mention willing and able.

125
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,309
I'll be at the...

126
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,711
Hey, I have this great idea.

127
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,269
Why don't we invite Diane
to come with us for dinner.

128
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,310
- What?
- No, I don't think that'd be a good idea.

129
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,750
No, don't be silly. It would be perfect.

130
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,797
Diane knows all about lndian food.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,073
Oh, hey, so do l. I'll order buffalo,
you can have the Geronimo burger.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,355
Claudia, I really don't
want to be a third wheel.

133
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,717
- Yeah, but I want you to come.
- Yeah, but I want us to be alone.

134
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,996
Well, there's plenty
of time for that later.

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,594
Besides, what could you do
in a restaurant full of people?

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,275
You'd be surprised.

137
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,950
- Yes, you would.
- Why don't you just butt out of this--

138
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,113
Look, Sam, I think you're being
kind of a drip about this.

139
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,636
Quite frankly, I am surprised at you.

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,837
Oh. Well, all right.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,675
Diane, if you have nothing better to do
than tag along, why don't you join us.

142
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,714
- I really don't think--
- No, please, Diane. I insist.

143
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,757
- lt'll be fun.
- Yeah, loads.

144
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,796
- Great, then we're set.
- Okay.

145
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,555
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- Okeydoke.

146
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,597
- Please get me out of this.
- No, no.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,360
If you don't go, she'll think
that I told you not to go.

148
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,637
And then she's gonna think I'm
even a bigger heel. You're going.

149
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,955
Okay. Fine. Fine.

150
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,715
You bet, "Fine. Fine."
Give me the phone, will you.

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
- Sam, you're out of your mind.
- Hey, please.

152
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,157
I may look stupid,
but I'm way ahead of her.

153
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,390
Give me some credit
for having brains. Hello.

154
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,518
Hello.

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,477
Yeah, this is Sam Malone.

156
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,871
I made a reservation
for two at 7::00.

157
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,470
I wanna make sure it's an intimate
table that seats only two.

158
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,234
Yeah, and there'll be
a third person coming along,

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,837
but I wanna make sure
that she's seated far away.

160
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,477
Yeah, no, no.
The farther the better.

161
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,471
In fact, do you have
something in Bombay?

162
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,038
- Goodbye.
- You're a genius.

163
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,196
I kind of think
I'm wasting my time here.

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,237
If Cliffie comes in,
tell him I was here.

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,277
Thanks for the beer.

166
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,749
- Aren't you gonna say something?
- I've got nothing to say.

167
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,758
Mr Clavin, maybe Cliff
will call you later.

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,752
Well,

169
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,593
he'd better make it fast.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

170
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,113
Gee, it's too bad.

171
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,192
I'd really like to make my peace
with the kid. Well, thanks anyway.

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,350
Hold it right there, Clavin.

173
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,512
I'm Cliff Clavin Jr.

174
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,758
You're Cliff.

175
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,270
You wasted your time coming here.

176
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,955
After what you've done, there can be
no peace between us. Hit the bricks.

177
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,192
Cliffie.

178
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,711
- What?
- What's that?

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,110
- Where?
- Gotcha!

180
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,634
Oh, Dad, you always knew
how to push the right buttons.

181
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,631
Hey.

182
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,350
I just can't stop
talking about that meal.

183
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,028
It was simple and delicate,
yet provocative.

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,033
Well, I never had anything
quite like that lamb vindaloo.

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,555
Great recommendation, Diane.

186
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,193
How was your meal, Sam?

187
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,148
The only thing that tasted good at the
table turned out later to be a candle.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,709
You're not still angry
about sitting alone?

189
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,672
I wasn't alone. You're forgetting
about that 300-pound Hindu

190
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,751
with the goitre that kept fanning me.

191
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,159
Look, Sam, I know this date hasn't
turned out the way you planned it.

192
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,676
Well, maybe we could still salvage
something of the evening.

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,400
Maybe we could go
someplace for dessert.

194
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,593
If I might make a suggestion, why
don't you two go upstairs to Melville's.

195
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,591
They have great cheesecake.

196
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,313
I have a better idea.

197
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,671
Why don't we go over to my place
for a little Sammy's jubilee.

198
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,479
The beer distributor, he says there's
some problem with next month's order.

199
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,917
Well, let him talk to Woody.
Woody handled it last month.

200
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,758
I think that's the problem.

201
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,320
Damn. All right, listen.

202
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,277
We'll go up to Melville's
for your cheesecake,

203
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,590
but then we're going to my place
for your beefcake.

204
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,549
You've got some work to do,
don't you?

205
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,795
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

206
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,076
- Norman.
- What's your pleasure, Mr Peterson?

207
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,193
Boxer shorts and loose shoes,
but I'll settle for a beer.

208
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,550
So how was the Hungry Heifer?

209
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,553
- It wasn't too good.
- No? Well, what'd you have?

210
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,310
Well, I got the chef's special ribs.

211
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,876
- That sounds pretty good.
- That's what I thought,

212
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,555
but the chef just came out
and made fun of my tie.

213
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,793
- So Cliffie and his dad not back yet?
- Oh, no, they had very big plans.

214
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,474
Mr Clavin wanted to spend
the evening getting to know his son.

215
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,558
Yeah, and the rest of his life
trying to forget.

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,474
Woody, next time you order
beer from the distributor,

217
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,632
try to be a little more
specific than "lots."

218
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,074
- Sorry, Sam.
- That's all right.

219
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,317
I called Melville's. They have
just two pieces of cheesecake left.

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,358
No more. No less. No Diane.

221
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,829
Boy, next to Sammy's life,
my life sure looks dull, doesn't it?

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,753
Next to a barnacle
my life seems dull.

223
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,637
Say, you know, that cheesecake
can be pretty fattening.

224
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,836
You got any ideas
how we could work it off?

225
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,509
- May I say something to you, Sam?
- Please.

226
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,235
You know, the first few times
that we went out,

227
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,995
I thought you were
coming on a little strong.

228
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,470
I now miss those gentler times.

229
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,193
Claudia, trust me.

230
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,989
You're about to come upon the
gentlest time that you've ever known.

231
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,798
Good Lord, Sam.

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,470
What? That was good.

233
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,237
I'm afraid we're just not
what each other's looking for.

234
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,118
All right, maybe you're right.

235
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,478
Oh, wait, listen, here.
I wanna wish you a happy life.

236
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,551
As happy as you can be without me.

237
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,231
There are no hard feelings here,
are there?

238
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,637
No, no, on the contrary.
I'm glad that this happened.

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,756
Because I feel that everything,

240
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,390
no matter how degrading
and humiliating,

241
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,438
should be experienced
at least once in life.

242
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,270
Well, wait a second, here, Claudia.
Let's talk about this.

243
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,078
Claudia.

244
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,198
Claudia left rather abruptly.
She didn't even say goodbye.

245
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,157
Was she upset about something?

246
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,117
Yeah, she was upset
about something.

247
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,999
Your little plan worked perfectly.

248
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,436
What are you talking about?

249
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,670
I can't believe you're
actually making me say this.

250
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,117
- What?
- Why don't you just admit

251
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,716
you're nuts about me and you can't
stand me going out with other women

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,348
so you try to eliminate
the competition.

253
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,069
Sam, your hormones have staged
a coup d'état on your brain.

254
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,829
No, no, no. Don't try to
distract me with hormone talk.

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,514
Well, as long as we're talking
about transparent plans,

256
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,917
why don't you just admit that you
brought that clone of me here

257
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,957
because you are still
hung up on me.

258
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,910
Are you kidding me? There is only
one reason why you came back here.

259
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,469
Because you asked me.

260
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,717
I asked you, you begged to come back.
We're splitting hairs here.

261
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,678
Sam, Melville's want to know
if you still want that cheesecake.

262
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,030
Yes, I want that cheesecake.
Tell them I'll be right up.

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm gonna go up and have
that cheesecake all by myself.

264
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,717
It'll be the best company
I've had all evening.

265
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,313
Indeed.

266
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,837
Unless you wanna come along and
make the evening a complete disaster.

267
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,790
I wouldn't have cheesecake with you
if you were the last man on Earth

268
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,509
and it was the last morsel of food.

269
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,591
I'm getting kind of used
to eating by myself anyway.

270
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,113
Well, it is delicious cheesecake.

271
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,997
Does your offer include coffee?

272
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,594
Maybe.

273
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,638
- And a refill?
- Don't push it.

274
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,833
Sam...

275
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,957
...I am sorry that you
had to eat alone.

276
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,838
That's okay.

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,355
What did you guys
talk about anyway?

278
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,159
Well, we talked about
the postmodernists

279
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,710
and the trend away from
minimalism in literature.

280
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,350
All of a sudden, my table
doesn't seem so bad after all.

281
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,073
And he says, "Yeah, my sister."

282
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,679
His sister!

283
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,991
Time for a little
in-flight refuelling here.

284
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,071
Oh, good.

285
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,748
Now you're good
for another 1,000 miles.

286
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,398
You two look like you've been having
a heck of a time. What did you do?

287
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,556
- lt'd be better to ask what we didn't do.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,676
How about if we just
withdrew the question.

289
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,440
We caught the first quarter
of the Celtics game,

290
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,950
went down to the petting zoo. It was
night, but we peeked over the fence.

291
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,749
Then we went fishing and Dad took me
to the all-night barber's to get a haircut.

292
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,798
Yeah, next time
he's gonna get them all cut.

293
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,239
Then later, we had a father-and-son
talk about the birds and bees.

294
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,595
Yeah, well, I already knew
about that stuff.

295
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,069
There was one thing
that was a little bit shocking.

296
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,875
Excuse me, Daddy.
I gotta make a pit stop.

297
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,555
Yeah, yeah, go right ahead.
I'll refuel a little myself.

298
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,432
Tell me about Cliffie. You guys
know him a lot better than I do.

299
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,239
- Is he really as nice as he seems?
- Oh, you bet.

300
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,193
And smart too. One of the
smartest guys I've ever met.

301
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,870
And dependable. You call Cliff
at 4::00 in the morning, he's there.

302
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,957
Where the hell else would he be?

303
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,677
Hey, Mr Clavin, do you have
the gift of gab like your son?

304
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,270
No, it comes from his mother's side.
She's the real yapper in the family.

305
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,830
My God, she gets rolling,
she's like a hyena on bennies.

306
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,478
Hey, Dad, come on.
Time's a-wasting.

307
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,200
What do you say we go out
and get a set of matching tattoos?

308
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,595
Cliffie, I gotta get cracking.
I got a plane to catch.

309
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,196
Come on, Dad. So much time,
you know, we haven't talked.

310
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,874
- We don't know about each other.
- Cliffie.

311
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,799
- I just had a terrific idea.
- Oh, yeah? What's that, Dad?

312
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,474
Why don't you
come to Australia with me.

313
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,918
Australia? I don't know if I can
leave all this. My friends, my job.

314
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,071
You can make new friends,
and you don't need a job.

315
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,433
- What?
- I got a lot of dough stashed away.

316
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,395
- Well, I need time to think about it.
- There's no time. I got to go now.

317
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,999
What's the rush?

318
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,509
I have got to get out of
this country as fast as I can.

319
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,834
- What's going on?
- Okay, listen. I'll level with you.

320
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,592
You're my son. I can trust you.

321
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,872
My business has gotten me
in a little trouble with the law.

322
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,076
- What kind of business is that?
- Real estate fraud.

323
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,673
- Dad, that's illegal.
- Good, I'm not going too fast for you.

324
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,032
Listen, come on,
you gonna come with me?

325
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,029
No, no, look, Dad,
I can't let you do this.

326
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,998
How about you give the money back,
throw yourself at the court's mercy.

327
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,832
They'll let you off with 1 0 years max.

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,231
Ten years. Come on, grow up, will you.
We're talking about heavy cake here.

329
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,755
Now, I want you to come.
Are you gonna come or no?

330
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,350
Well, how do you know
I'm not gonna turn you in?

331
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,830
Cliffie, you're not gonna
turn in your own father.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,070
I know that and you know that.

333
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,952
Yeah, you're right, Dad.

334
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,512
I had a couple beers. I'm gonna make
one more stop and then I'm gone.

335
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,158
Give me the phone.

336
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,833
What's wrong?

337
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,515
My old man's a crook. He's leaving
the country one step ahead of the law.

338
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,592
You're not gonna
rat on your old man!

339
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,034
Think about this, will you.

340
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,952
Got nothing to think about now.

341
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,952
Information?

342
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,749
Yeah, give me the federal authorities.

343
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,955
I don't know. Somebody
in charge of rotten daddies.

344
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,151
I can't do it.

345
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,431
I've aided a fugitive from justice.

346
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,397
I'm a disgrace to my uniform.

347
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,994
Hey, come on. Come off it, Clavin.

348
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,799
You didn't disgrace anything.

349
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,430
You can't turn the old guy in
because you love him.

350
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,273
Now, anyone would understand that.

351
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,437
Thank you, Carla.

352
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,399
You're right.

353
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,232
I do love him.

354
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,108
Matter of fact, I think I'll go
give him a big hug right now.

355
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,190
It might be a little uncool to hug him
in the men's room, you know?

356
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,476
I guess you're right, Norm.

357
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,759
What the heck. I can't wait. It's
the longest we've been apart all day.

358
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,431
Carla, you know, for a minute there,

359
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,114
you treated Cliff
as if he was a human being.

360
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,194
What you are experiencing
is a half-melvin.

361
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,798
You breathe one word of this and
I am going to give you a full-melvin.

362
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,791
I think we understand each other.

363
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,718
He's gone.

364
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,556
This is all that's left.

365
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,310
What do you suppose
happened to him?

366
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,996
It's obvious, isn't it?

367
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,197
My father didn't trust me,

368
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,954
so he gave me the slip
out of the bathroom window.

369
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,919
Guess I'll just go home.

370
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,272
You're ruling out
the other possibility.

371
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,159
What other possibility?

372
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,515
Well, it's a little-known fact,

373
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,993
but more and more people have been
going into men's rooms and vaporizing.

374
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,355
I mean, just disappearing
into thin air.

375
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,953
It's an unexplained phenomenon.

376
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,475
- It's kind of like the Bermuda Triangle.
- That's right.

377
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,068
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get serious, will you.

378
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,038
Have it your way.

379
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,314
Well, you know, however,

380
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,232
this much is true, you know.

381
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,436
There's been recent sightings
of human beings

382
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,512
being shot up into the underbelly
of alien spacecraft.

383
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,796
You know, and speaking
of the Bermuda Triangle,

384
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,110
- it's not technically a triangle.
- It's not?

385
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,032
Heck, no!

386
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,668
It's a trapezedo-rhomboid.

387
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,838
They're perfect for attracting
Martian spacecraft.
