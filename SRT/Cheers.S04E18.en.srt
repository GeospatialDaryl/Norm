1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,676
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,595
Mrs Tortelli?

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,194
Oh, you must be Vito Ragonzoni.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,719
That's right.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,110
The young man who wants
to take out my little Anne Marie.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,754
- Yes, ma'am.
- Soda, Sam.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,388
Thanks for coming by, Vito.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,834
Anne Marie told me that you wanted
to take her to the movies,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,037
and I just wanted to meet you, get to
know you a little better, you know.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,639
Okay.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,591
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,034
Well...

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,920
You certainly are a fine-looking
young gentleman.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,832
- No doubt about that.
- Thank you, ma'am.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,678
What movie you taking
Anne Marie to see?

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,632
101 Dalmatians.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,752
- Oh, that's a Walt Disney, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,354
Oh, one of my favourites, as I recall.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,080
It is not only entertaining--

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,395
Turn to the left, please.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,432
--it has a nice message.
Now to the right.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,628
Thank you.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,554
Ms Tortelli, I'm getting the feeling
that you don't trust me too much.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,593
Oh, gee, Vito, I'm sorry. I guess
I'm being a little overprotective.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,115
You know, it's my little baby's
first date.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,229
But now that I see you, I see you're
a fine upstanding gentleman,

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,595
so here, tell you what. Go on,
get out of here.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,432
Have some popcorn on me.
Have a good time.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,636
Thanks, Mrs Tortelli.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,196
Sam...

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,955
...keep it in a safe place till the boys
from the lab get here.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,718
A hearty heigh-ho, everyone.

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,797
Hey, Frasier.

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,394
- What's with the bird there?
- Oh, do you like it?

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,357
I was doing some spring-cleaning
the other day,

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,273
and I came across old Plato here.
He was my father's pet.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,557
Couldn't bear to part with him, not
even in death, so he had him stuffed.

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,757
He's really got a lot of
sentimental value for me.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,036
He's an excellent example
of taxidermy.

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,158
Quite valuable, I'm sure.
And I'd like you to have him.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,953
Frasier, I don't think so.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,991
- Well, then toss it.
- All right.

43
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,914
Oh, and, Diane,

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,310
I came across these slides
of our trip to Europe.

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,550
I didn't want to throw them away
and didn't want them.

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,029
I thought perhaps you'd like them.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,954
Oh, that's very thoughtful, Frasier.
I'd love to look at them.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,597
Well, hey, I got a projector
and a screen in the backroom there.

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,637
You said that projector was broken

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,598
when I wanted to show my slides
of Colombian art.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,679
Well, yes, it is broken when you wanna
show your slides of Colombian art.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
I don't see any reason why we should
show these slides here.

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,079
Well, why not? I think those slides
might benefit everyone.

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,629
It's a chance to see Europe's
cultural and artistic highlights

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,950
with an informed commentary
by people who've been there.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,759
Anyone who wants to see slides
of Diane's and my trip to Europe,

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,592
raise your hands.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,673
You could make disgusting noises
and shadow animals.

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,951
Fine. I'll go set it up.

60
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,312
- Say, Cliff.
- Yeah?

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,199
Slides of the European trip, poolroom,
five minutes. Be there.

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,191
Hey. Hey, yeah, great.
Wouldn't miss it.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,710
There's a major yawn.

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,350
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,829
- Norman.
- Hey, what's happening, Norm?

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,792
You know, it's a dog-eat-dog world,
Sammy,

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,951
and I'm wearing Milk-Bone underwear.

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,992
Yeah.

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,913
Vera has been phoning
every 15 minutes here.

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,749
So, what's this for?

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,350
Well, I told her you'd call
the second you got in.

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,391
- Well, you lied.
- All right.

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,875
Norman, maybe it's an emergency.

74
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,672
No, I know why she's calling.

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,070
You know the account-manager job
I'm up for?

76
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,037
Well, it's between me
and this one other guy,

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,191
and today's the day they're
making their decision.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,998
Pins and needles time, huh?

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,276
Yeah. Vera's really a mess,
you know.

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,790
Except she's always had kind of a low
threshold for excitement, you know.

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,799
Yeah. You wouldn't believe
the tizzy she went into

82
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,077
the day she cracked open
a double-yolked egg.

83
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,748
I made the mistake of telling Vera
that if I get the promotion,

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,512
we could buy a new house.
You know, so...

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,513
It's always been a dream of hers
to have house with a bathroom so big,

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,752
if you fall down,
you won't hit your head on anything.

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,439
Well, now, that's smart. That's smart.

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,239
Because, little-known fact,
42 percent of all deaths in America

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,118
are caused by accidents
in the home.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,390
So were you.

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,637
Anyway, these guys, they're really
giving us the full treatment.

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,469
- What?
- Yesterday, the executive wives

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,915
invited Vera to a luncheon
at a fancy French restaurant.

94
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,230
- Hey, hey.
- Experience really changed her.

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,709
She now refers to the Velveeta
as fromage, thank you.

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,194
Well, you must be getting pretty
excited about this yourself.

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,515
- Yeah.
- Not really.

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,990
- Come on, man. Come on. Come on.
- All right, all right, I'm psyched.

99
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,230
All right.

100
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,955
Norman.

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,153
If diligence, dedication and
the old-fashioned puritan work ethic

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,629
have anything to do with it, I'm sure...

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,112
Good luck, Norman.

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,437
Well, it's time I stopped avoiding
the success

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,556
that's been nipping at my heels
all these years.

106
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,796
- My whole life stands before me.
- Right.

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,110
I'm poised here on the brink
of destiny, guys.

108
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,271
- Yeah, yeah.
- Look out, world, get off my runway.

109
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,192
Ho! Look out!

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,118
Hey, is everybody ready
for the slide show?

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,073
Yeah, what the hell.
I got nothing better to do.

112
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,035
All right, everybody. Filter on in here.
There's plenty of seats for everybody.

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,513
Yup, come along, now. Come along.

114
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,877
Now, if everybody's passports
are in order,

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,079
we begin our sojourn
in merry old England.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,110
Yes. Here's Diane
at the Tower of London.

117
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,639
Where's the tower?

118
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,834
It's right there.
She's standing in front of it.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,952
Yeah.

120
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,429
And here she is at
the changing of the guard.

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,990
- Where are the guards?
- Well, if you look very closely,

122
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,879
you can see them in the reflection
of her sunglasses.

123
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,389
Which hide her eyes.
Which hide her emotions.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,230
And here she is in front of Big Ben.

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,197
That wall looks just like
the other wall.

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,952
But imagine that at the top of this wall
there's a clock.

127
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,114
Do you actually ever take pictures
of things where you could

128
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,589
see the things themselves?

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,438
- Well, I'm sure I must have.
- Well...

130
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,918
Scenery at last.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,351
Now, this is Diane boating
on the Seine.

132
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,232
- Oh, yeah.
- You know,

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,233
I think that was my last carefree day
on the Continent.

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,031
But I digress.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,879
Yeah. Here she is pretending to enjoy
herself in front of Notre Dame.

136
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,351
I was enjoying myself.

137
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,988
Of course you were.
I didn't mean to imply anything else.

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,350
And on to sunny ltaly.

139
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,232
Boy, she doesn't look happy there,
does she?

140
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,755
- No.
- How could she?

141
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,673
She was much too preoccupied
with thoughts of desertion.

142
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,628
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry. Ignore that.

143
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,276
Ah, yes, beautiful Florence.

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,313
She looks just like Miss Chambers.

145
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,479
It is Diane, Woody.

146
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,710
I think this is the night
I proposed to her.

147
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,710
Yes. You see, she's laughing at me.

148
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,470
I am not laughing at you.
I'm smiling for the camera.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,071
Of course you were.
You're about to rip out my heart.

150
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,392
Yes. Yes, here she is plotting her
betrayal in front of the Ponte Vecchio.

151
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,630
How appropriate,
in the country of Lucrezia Borgia.

152
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,877
- Frasier, you're incorrigible.
- Oh, Diane, wait.

153
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,752
No, wait. Hey, let her--

154
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,838
Well, that was a thrill a minute,
huh, Norm?

155
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,549
I'd say your Florida slides
were better than that, Cliffie.

156
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,354
Oh, I got them in the trunk of my car.

157
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,191
It's a good place for them.

158
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,316
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
I thought I was getting better.

159
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,074
Frasier, sit down.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,595
You keep saying you're getting better,

161
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,075
but I haven't seen any evidence of it.

162
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,796
Now, hard as it may be, you've got to
stop being preoccupied with me.

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,110
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Enough said.

164
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,191
You don't have to hit Frasier Crane
over the head.

165
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,510
Unless, of course, you'd like to.

166
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,274
Where is your sense of humour?

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,632
Frasier, here.

168
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,155
Listen, been a long time since
I went out and raised a little hell.

169
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,113
What do you say you and I go out
and get crazy?

170
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,511
You know, a couple of guys giving
the women of Boston their best shot?

171
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,709
- Well, this is a pity offer, isn't it?
- Basically.

172
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,512
Okay.

173
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,594
Might be just what the doctor ordered.
Rattle my cage a little.

174
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,712
All right, that's the ticket. Listen,
I got a few things to do for a while,

175
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,314
so why don't you just sit down here
and be a good little boy,

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,278
and Sammy Claus will take you out
later and get your tree trimmed.

177
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,360
- Hey, Norm.
- Jeff. What are you doing here?

178
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,750
I just wanna have a beer
with the new accounts manager.

179
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,951
- Did I get the job?
- I haven't heard anything definite,

180
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,277
but if I had an extra dollar to wager,
I'd bet it on Norm Peterson.

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,670
Since I don't,
could you buy me a beer?

182
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,391
All right. Woody, two beers.

183
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,073
- Come on. Have a seat.
- Great, great.

184
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,191
I just wanted to come down
and wish you good luck.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,396
There's a lot of scuttlebutt
around the water cooler

186
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,357
that you and Morrison
are neck and neck.

187
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,273
But there's a lot of us down in
the trenches who are pulling for you.

188
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,036
Thanks. That means a lot
coming from your peers.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,191
I just hope when you're up
in the executive suite

190
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,555
and I'm down in steerage
we can still be friends.

191
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,076
Of course. Were we before?

192
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,993
"Were we before?"
Oh, God, that's great.

193
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,435
Oh, I tell you, it's gonna be so great

194
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,194
to have somebody up there with
a sense of humour. That's terrific.

195
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,477
And by the way, that was a brilliant job
you did on the Stallings audit.

196
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,558
I mean, who else would've figured out
how to write off Mrs Stallings'

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,110
- breast reduction as a depreciation?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,393
You know, I hear that Stallings will be
eligible for parole in our lifetime.

199
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,755
Does anyone have more fun
than bookkeepers?

200
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,510
Oh, face it, Norm,
you deserve to win.

201
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,750
You're more experienced,
you're a nicer guy,

202
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,150
and you got some professional ethics,
unlike Morrison.

203
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,953
What are you talking about?

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,553
Are you kidding?

205
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,837
You don't know about Morrison
and the boss's wife?

206
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,437
They've been making it every
Tuesday night for the past five months.

207
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,070
- Jeffrey, I can't believe that.
- No, I'm serious.

208
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,591
Once a week?

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,276
Well, I guess if you're young,
you can handle that kind of schedule.

210
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,993
I better shove off.

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,078
- Mrs Reinhardt?
- Mrs Reinhardt.

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,309
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah.

213
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,074
Would you promise me one thing?
When you get the promotion

214
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,198
and it's time to hire an assistant,
you'll remember my name?

215
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,472
- Sure. Yeah. What's that last name?
- You big lug, you.

216
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,837
That's Warren, with two R's.
W-A-R-R-E-N.

217
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,557
Well... Woody,
a little champagne, please.

218
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,958
Sammy, some cigars for all my friends.
On the new accounts manager.

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,231
No kidding, Norm? You got the job?

220
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,991
No, not yet, but just learned a little bit
of information about my competition

221
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,431
that ought to clinch it
when I accidentally let it slip.

222
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,392
All right, Norm.

223
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,989
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,312
Norm, I might have spoken out of turn
about Morrison and Mrs Reinhardt.

225
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,278
You wouldn't let it go any further,
would you?

226
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,795
Jeffrey, I'm insulted, man.

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,475
So as I was about to say,
Jeff here lets it slip

228
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,234
that my competition's making
the sheets sing with the boss's wife.

229
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,715
Oh, yeah, that's pretty hot
information there, isn't it?

230
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,239
You're gonna rat on him?

231
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,512
No, I'm gonna sing "Moon River"
outside their motel room.

232
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,709
I know you want this job pretty bad.
You think that's the way to go about it?

233
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,553
I have to agree, Norman.
This just isn't you talking.

234
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,757
You're not the ruthless, cutthroat,
aggressive type.

235
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,469
I don't know where you guys
got the idea that I'm just some

236
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,279
passive, easygoing lump.

237
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,954
Norm, if your buns didn't fall asleep,
you'd never get off the bar stool.

238
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,515
They're wide awake now, guys,
and I want this promotion.

239
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,233
I want it for Vera. She deserves it.

240
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,313
Norman, think for a moment
what you're about to do.

241
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,879
This could even backfire on you.

242
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,349
You don't even know
if this terrible rumour is true.

243
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,033
Well, I have a pretty good idea
it might be.

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,156
Mrs Reinhardt came on to me
at the Christmas party.

245
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,955
What did she say?

246
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,350
"Move it. You're standing
in front of the cheese dip."

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,468
But she said it with bedroom eyes.

248
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,511
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

249
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,389
You guys all think that this is a bad
idea for me to use this information?

250
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,199
Of course we do.

251
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,678
Not everybody.

252
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,990
You know, Norm,
this Morrison is an adulterer

253
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,197
and shouldn't be allowed
to prosper by it.

254
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,836
Now, if we let this type of un-American
activity go unchecked,

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,956
before you know it,
our leaders will be in chains,

256
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,190
our women will be learning
how to shot put,

257
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,909
and all we vital American males
will be force-fed borscht

258
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,675
along with generous helpings
of Das Kapital.

259
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,674
That's not those fish eggs, is it?

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,311
No, but it smells as bad.

261
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,037
Well, then you tell them
Woody Boyd says nyet.

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,956
Attaboy, Woody.

263
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,713
Norman, a snitch is the lowest thing
on this earth.

264
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,350
You know it. Little kids know it.
Old ladies know it.

265
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,479
Dirty, rotten-toothed prisoners
in dark, wet cells know it.

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,357
Norman, if you tell on this guy,
and your friends find out about it,

267
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,239
- they are gonna hate your guts.
- How are they gonna know?

268
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,478
I'll squeal like a stuck pig.

269
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,919
Norm, come on. You can't do this.

270
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,116
All right. You're right, you're right.

271
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,356
Guys don't tell on other guys.

272
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,192
It's just not right. I can't do it.

273
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,471
Hey, Frasier, I'm ready if you are.

274
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,875
Oh, wonderful.
Let's begin our evening of revelry.

275
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,952
All right. Now, listen.
I wanna get one thing straight:

276
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,793
Tonight, I don't wanna hear one word
about Diane Chambers. Okay?

277
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,838
We're gonna get out there and get
your mind on more pleasant things.

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,353
Agreed. Where are we going?

279
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,957
Well, I think the first thing we need
is some female companionship.

280
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,475
I know a couple of the hot spots,

281
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,790
so why don't we just
mosey along here.

282
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,515
Let me tell you how
this evening's gonna go here.

283
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,831
Now, we're gonna probably walk
into some really nice little spot there.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,275
You're gonna see a beautiful woman
across the room.

285
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,198
I mean hot, sexy.

286
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,913
A woman you dream about.

287
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,957
All right, now, her friend is for you.

288
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,238
Got it?

289
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,557
Good Lord. That's my boss,
Mr Reinhardt.

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,512
That's the poor sap, huh?

291
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,558
Cliffie, quick, breath test.
What do you smell when I do this?

292
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,996
Milwaukee.

293
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,748
Mr Reinhardt.
Hi, sir, how are you do--?

294
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,037
Coincidence that you caught me in
here. I was just using the washroom.

295
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,952
- What do you say we...?
- At ease, Peterson.

296
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,159
We know you spend a lot of time here.
This is where we send your checks.

297
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,635
That's very good.
That's good, sir. That's good.

298
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,078
Well, have a seat.
So to what do I owe this pleasure?

299
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,999
Well, I wanted to come
and tell you in person.

300
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,879
It's not the easiest thing
I've ever had to say,

301
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,996
but you didn't get the job.

302
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,510
I appreciate your coming here
to tell me that, sir.

303
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,070
It was a tossup between you
and Morrison right up to the end.

304
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,872
I have to tell you, in virtually every way,
you match up perfectly.

305
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,868
You both exemplify the high standards
we expect from our employees.

306
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,554
In fact, we can't find a black mark
against either one of you.

307
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,189
Your behaviour and Morrison's,
in and out of the office, is impeccable.

308
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,909
If there were--
If there were just one thing,

309
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,476
one tiny thing to tip the scale
in your favour,

310
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,475
I'd go to bat for you.

311
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,918
Sir, I think I ought
to tell you something.

312
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,434
This is terribly personal,
and it could really be painful for you.

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,390
Probably gonna change your life
in every way...

314
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,551
...but before I get into it,

315
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,916
would you like a cheese doodle?

316
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,352
I have a craving for... Could I have
some cheese doodles, please?

317
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,069
- No, Norman.
- Yeah, yes, Norm. Yes, yes.

318
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,478
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, do it, do it. Yes, yes, yes.

319
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,718
Who are those people, Peterson,

320
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,838
and why doesn't one of them
want you to have a cheese doodle?

321
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,713
She's actually-- She's trying to help me
watch my dairy intake, sir.

322
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,319
Well, what was the terribly personal
thing you were gonna tell me

323
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,836
- that's gonna change my life?
- Oh, that.

324
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,908
It was-- That was nothing. You had
something in between your teeth.

325
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,590
Do you have a--? No, no, no. It's--
I guess, you know, it's gone now.

326
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,354
That combination of syllables
in your last sentence

327
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,875
- must have just kicked it right out, sir.
- I see.

328
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,793
- Well, I'd best be going.
- Sir.

329
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,712
There's something you're
not telling me here.

330
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,552
I mean, why didn't I get this job?

331
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,836
Oh, I suppose I owe you
the truth, Peterson.

332
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,036
Well, yeah, you do.

333
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,918
It's your wife.

334
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,752
What does my wife
have to do with this?

335
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,277
Well, she didn't fit in with
the other company wives.

336
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,638
That's-- Vera's a wonderful woman.
What are you talking--?

337
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,394
Well, yes, I'm sure
in her own circle she is,

338
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,190
but that lunch the other wives took
her to yesterday was sort of a test.

339
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,830
A spouse has to be able to mix easily
with other people in the company.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,912
That's just great. Well, that's great.
Sir, tell you what.

341
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,640
If my wife isn't good enough
for this company, neither am l.

342
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,156
Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way,
Peterson. But I understand.

343
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,834
And I admire you
for your loyalty to her.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,878
Now, wait a minute. Morrison's wife is
somehow more acceptable than mine?

345
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,355
No. As a matter of fact,
Morrison's never had a wife.

346
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,757
Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't be too sure
about that one, sir.

347
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,398
- Good luck.
- All right, fine.

348
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,871
I'm so sorry, Norman.

349
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,912
Thanks. That was the easy part.

350
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,356
Now I have to break the news
to Vera.

351
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,990
What are you gonna tell her?

352
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,236
The truth, I guess.

353
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,756
When she went to lunch with the
other wives, she didn't pass muster.

354
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,589
Well, maybe she couldn't reach it.

355
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,158
Hi, Vera.

356
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,478
Listen, honey, no point
beating around the bush here.

357
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,835
I didn't get the promotion.

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,709
In fact, I just got so mad at the guy,
I just went ahead and quit.

359
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,472
Yeah. Yes. Yes, they did,
they gave me a reason, hon.

360
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,954
They said...

361
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,797
...that...

362
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,797
...well, what they said was, I'm just not
the right man for the job, you know.

363
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,869
You just face it, honey, I'm a loser.

364
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,153
I don't know why you just don't go just
pack up your bags and leave me.

365
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,992
Hello?

366
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,158
That's very funny. That's cute.

367
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,357
Listen, sweetie.
There's something I have to tell you.

368
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,590
Even on a terrible day like today,

369
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,036
I feel like I'm the luckiest man
in the world, because I married you.

370
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,159
I don't know.
I've had two, three, maybe.

371
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,229
I'll talk to you later. Yeah.

372
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,395
- Norman?
- Yeah.

373
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,795
That's one of the finest things
I have ever seen a man do.

374
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,473
Yes.

375
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,312
How great, I'm unemployed.

376
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,875
Don't worry, Mr Peterson.
Something else will come along.

377
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,356
No, no, I mean, great, I'm unemployed.
Give me a beer here.
