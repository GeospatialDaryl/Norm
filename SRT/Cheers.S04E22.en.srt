1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,837
Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,471
Hey, man, where's this
relief waitress you hired?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,878
Oh, don't worry, Sam, she's a great
waitress, a complete professional.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,399
Well, how come she's not here?

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,398
Well, she called and said
she'd be about 20 minutes late.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,239
She wants to get in
all her breaks before she starts.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,516
Oh, there she is.
Hey, Corinne, over here.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,393
When you asked them
for a waitress,

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,632
did you tell them this was a bar,
not a truck stop?

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,512
Hi, honey. Is this it?

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,110
Yep, Corinne, this is my boss,
Sam Malone.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,158
Hi, honey. Just give me
some checks and we're all set.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,876
Okay, Woody, why don't you
show her where they are?

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,519
It's right down here.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,709
Would you look
at the size of this place?

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,798
My dogs'll be barking tonight.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,078
Pardon me, am I mistaken, or did you
used to work at the Hungry Heifer?

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,191
- Sure, I worked there.
- Yeah?

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,631
Say, I know you. The girls there
had a pet name for you.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,038
- What was that?
- That guy who comes back.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,353
Hey, listen, thanks for helping out.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,999
From now on
let me pick the waitresses.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,879
My customers are used to something
with a little more sex appeal.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,830
Sam. Where'd you get the fox?

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,034
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,597
- How's life in the fast lane, Normie?
- Beats me. I can't find the on-ramp.

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,912
Hey, hey, your brow is
a little furrowed there, my friend.

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,513
What's the boney, Maroney?

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,877
Well, Vera's getting the urge
to go on vacation again.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,275
Don't worry. It'll pass.
Happens every year.

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,752
I think she's serious this time.
Maps have been unfolded.

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,713
- Where does she wanna go?
- The tropics.

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,918
Says she wants to lay in the sand
and bake in the sun.

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,109
I offered a compromise.

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,876
I said, just turn up the radiator
and stick your feet in the cat box.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,313
- And she didn't go for that?
- No, no. It's my own damn fault.

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,232
You know,
I think I've spoiled that woman.

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,039
Mr Peterson, if you want
the vacation of a lifetime,

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,873
without spending a fortune,
I have one word for you:

40
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,311
- Yeah?
- Hanover, lndiana.

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,069
All right. Well, what would I do for
excitement in, say, Hanover, lndiana?

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,192
Well, if you leave right away,
you can catch the Corn Parade.

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,078
Now, that's kind of like
the Rose Parade.

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,037
But instead of using flowers
for the floats--

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,595
- They use corn.
- You've heard of it.

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,799
Well, hold on a second.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,791
- Carla, it's for you.
- Who is it?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,638
I don't know.
It's one of your daughters.

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,751
- Which one?
- I couldn't tell.

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,515
- It sounded like, "Humanity."
- Oh, it's Anne Marie.

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,559
She's wearing a retainer on her teeth,
and she's feeling a little insecure.

52
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,671
Anne Marie?

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,917
No, I didn't know it was you
from your ugly voice.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,236
Hon, no. Anne Marie,
people are not gonna make fun of you

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,039
every time you open your mouth.

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,391
Honey, your family are not people.

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,879
Yeah, right, goodbye.

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,556
Poor kid.

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,591
I remember when I was
at that awkward age.

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,433
Any little difference between me
and the other children

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,236
and I was embarrassed and humiliated
in front of what felt like the world.

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,596
- Hi, Diane.
- And on it goes.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,952
You left your sweater
at my apartment.

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,994
Oh, thank you, Dennis.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,716
And thanks for bringing it by
in this all-too-brief visit.

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,715
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I'm working the Renaissance Faire.

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,836
Don't they have
dressing rooms there?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,515
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
You said it was your favourite era.

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,591
Dennis, there's a time and place
for everything.

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,832
And the time for this
was the 14th century.

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,196
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for Saturday night?

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,429
Next Saturday would be impossible.

73
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,517
You don't wanna
go out with me again, do you?

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,989
I didn't say that, Dennis.
You're putting words in my mouth.

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,593
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,228
No, no, they're the right words.

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,234
I'll give you a call, Dennis.

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,588
All right. I know what's coming.
Let's get on with it.

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,872
- What? What are you talking about?
- You know. Dennis.

80
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,832
He didn't, well...

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,274
- He didn't look very ordinary.
- Oh, nonsense.

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,668
I thought he looked great.

83
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,276
Especially if he was gonna
spend the day in Sherwood Forest.

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,351
You're not being very fair.
Dennis is a really special guy.

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,120
Yeah, and I sensed that, Diane.
I said to myself--

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,154
As soon as he walked in, I said,
now there's a sissy with a dream.

87
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,433
Dennis Kaufman
is a brilliant puppeteer.

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,198
He does a wonderful
Punch and Judy.

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,949
He'd better have a wonderful punch
if he's gonna dress like Judy.

90
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,033
Oh, you really pick them, Diane.

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,350
Next to him,
even Frasier looks like Rambo.

92
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,558
Look what I've stooped to.
Dennis is a fine human being,

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,234
and I hustled him out of here
like he had the plague.

94
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,115
All in an effort
to avoid your childish gibes.

95
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,398
How will I ever make it up to him?

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,512
Well, you could always
offer to set his hair.

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,637
Fine, fine. Thank you all.

98
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,593
Oh, come on. You're overreacting.

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,553
We were simply indulging in a couple
of yuks. Were we not, guys?

100
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,356
Well, I can understand
why you act like this,

101
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,353
and Sam stooping to such
puerile behaviour.

102
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,479
You're jealous. But I don't know
why everyone else jumps in.

103
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,877
Now, Woody here was the
only one of you mature enough

104
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,073
to refrain from jumping on
your mudslinging bandwagon.

105
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,589
Well, why should l, Miss Chambers?
I liked Denise.

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,194
- No, that's Dennis.
- I know.

107
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,635
Hey, Normie?

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,268
You feel like doing something
adventurous tonight?

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,074
I'm already doing that, Cliffie.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,315
Vera's trying on a new
facial mask this evening,

111
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,308
and I kind of wanna rush home
and watch it crack.

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,114
- All right.
- Why? What did you have in mind?

113
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,153
Well, I heard from one of the guys
down in the junk-mail room

114
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,711
that there's a new act down at
the old Wham Bam Room.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,831
Oh, hot dog.

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,918
Presenting the finest
in nudie entertainment.

117
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,354
Come on, Fras, what do you say?
Let's go.

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,915
Oh, you're inviting me along
to this evening of devilment?

119
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,839
- You got a credit card, don't you?
- There you go.

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,919
You know, I'm not so sure if it really
fits in with my image, you know?

121
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,554
A desperately lonely character
on the make?

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,034
- Well, I guess I'm in.
- All right.

123
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,556
Oh, sure.
Just when I'm about to have fun.

124
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,035
- That's Mrs Benedict.
- How did you know that?

125
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,310
Because she's the person
I'd least like to hear from.

126
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,870
Even her beep is whiny.
Excuse me, just two seconds.

127
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,719
Guys, Carla, get your coats.
You're coming over to my place.

128
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,195
Tonight, on the tube,
The Magnificent Seven.

129
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,675
Cliffie, the Wham Bam Room
will always be there,

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,671
but only tonight will the Seven ride.

131
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,110
Say no more.
Bronson, McQueen, Coburn.

132
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,791
- Don't think I ever saw that one.
- You're kidding.

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,439
Then tonight you become a man.

134
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,279
- Well, I'm off.
- Hey, change of plans, Frasier.

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,118
The Magnificent Seven,
Sammy's TV, tonight.

136
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,796
The Seven? Great.
I never miss a Horst Buchholz film.

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,310
Listen, l-- Tell you what.
I'll catch up to you

138
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,835
just as soon as I talk Mrs Benedict
out of her hamper.

139
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,752
You guys do this a lot?

140
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,394
Well, yeah, every time
one of the classics is on TV,

141
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,755
we all head over to Sammy's,
make some popcorn,

142
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,239
and glue our eyeballs to the set.

143
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,353
You know, I'm not ordinarily a fan
of American Westerns,

144
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,996
but because The Magnificent Seven
is a remake of the far superior

145
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,232
and more complex Japanese film,
The Seven Samurai,

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,152
a comparison will be interesting.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,148
We'll be sure to do that. Now you don't
mind locking up, do you, sweetheart?

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,953
Oh, of course not.

149
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
We didn't hear anything.

150
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,512
No, no, I'm gonna check this out.

151
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,674
I'm sorry. You wanna come
with us, sweetheart?

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,237
No. I don't wanna ruin your fun.

153
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,554
When I first walked into this place,
I felt like an alien,

154
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,554
and four years later,
I still feel like an alien.

155
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,558
Well, if the antenna fits.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,149
Diane, wait a second.

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,636
- I just wanna go home, Sam.
- Well, maybe if you...

158
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,951
I don't know, guys.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,190
I don't feel good
about the movie tonight.

160
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,552
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

161
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,998
Cheers.

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,399
Oh, hi, Diane. Why aren't you here?
Are you sick or something?

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,553
Oh, well, you sound all stuffed up.

164
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,309
Well, I hope you feel better.
Bye-bye.

165
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,748
- What's the matter with her?
- She said she's got this allergy

166
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,428
where you weep uncontrollably.

167
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,671
What do you think?
Do you think we hurt her feelings

168
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,796
a little bit too much last night?

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,639
Hey, maybe we ought to
do something to make it up to her.

170
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,513
- Like send her a bouquet of flowers.
- Oh, cliché city, huh?

171
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,878
You know, whenever I break the heart
of a member of the gentler sex,

172
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,352
I always send her a nice
box of dried figs.

173
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,874
Figs won't do it.

174
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,949
Let me see if I can explain this.

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,278
Diane has always tried
to take part in your activities.

176
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,358
Why don't you return the favour
by joining her

177
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,149
in something she finds entertaining?

178
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,071
Oh, boy. All right, what egghead
torture do we have to endure now?

179
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,635
Well, how about the opera?

180
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,876
- Oh, man, come on.
- Oh, gross.

181
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,629
It's not like we threw her
down a flight of stairs. Come on.

182
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,115
Tell you what. Leave it to me.

183
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
I'll make all the arrangements,
right down to her favourite flowers.

184
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,628
All you guys have to do
is just show up.

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,158
All right, what do you say, guys?
I mean, it's the least we could do.

186
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,950
- Well?
- All right, all right, all right.

187
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,357
Do me a favour, just pick an opera
where it doesn't sound like

188
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,796
somebody backing over a cat.
Please.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,035
We do happen to be in luck.

190
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,272
You see, they're playing
Diane's favourite tomorrow night.

191
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,789
Lucia di Lammermoor
by Donizetti.

192
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,632
Yeah? Well, count me out.

193
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,751
You know, every time we had
a family gathering,

194
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,751
they always tried to get me
interested in opera.

195
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,558
I just couldn't stand it.

196
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,671
It's just a bunch
of fat, homely people

197
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,628
screeching
and trying to stab each other.

198
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,478
Well, Carla, you know,
not all operas are like that.

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,720
I was talking about
the family gathering.

200
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,558
Check it out, boys. Better than
the skyview seats at Fenway.

201
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,076
Look at these chairs.
They're not even bolted down.

202
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,952
Oh, hey, that's class for you.

203
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,554
Boy, you gotta really hand it
to Frasier, don't you?

204
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,991
He really knows what melts
Diane's butter. Look at this.

205
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,990
All right, all right,
now if we stick together tonight,

206
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,673
I think we won't have
any casualties.

207
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,269
Hey, hey, just as long as you
remember your job there, Woody.

208
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,432
Anybody starts falling asleep,
give them a nudge.

209
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,795
Hey, don't worry, Mr Clavin.
There's no way I'm gonna fall asleep.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,515
I had a four-hour nap this afternoon,
drank 12 cups of coffee,

211
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,910
and I'm wearing extra-tight shoes.

212
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,469
- So where's Diane?
- Oh, she's powdering her nose.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,870
She started to cry again.
I mean, what a woman, huh?

214
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,349
Do you believe that?
She started to cry when we told her

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,557
we're gonna take her to the opera, she
cried when she saw us in our tuxes.

216
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,711
And she cried
when she saw the limo.

217
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,639
She's got it under control, though.
She said she won't do it anymore.

218
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,798
No, thank you. I'll seat myself.

219
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,035
Oh, this is the best box.

220
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,439
- Now, you promised--
- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

221
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,279
Madame, your seat.

222
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,670
No, no. Come on, yeah, that's good.

223
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,238
Gentlemen.

224
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,518
What a glorious night.

225
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,315
Somebody pinch me.
That's just an expression, Cliff.

226
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,714
On second thought, don't pinch me.
If this is a dream,

227
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,074
I do not want to awaken.

228
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,314
Listen, I know that you're all
novices to the opera,

229
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,590
so I'd like to give you
a little background.

230
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,714
Tonight's performance is in ltalian.

231
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,879
I'm sure that you will find it
both enlightening and entertaining.

232
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,116
Oh, by the way,
does anyone need opera glasses?

233
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,757
Oh, no, no. I brought
a pair of my own there, Diane.

234
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,271
Cliffie, think those are
powerful enough, pal?

235
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,993
You better believe it, Norm. Get a load
of the warheads on that cellist.

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,873
No, hey, hey, hey.
Don't, don't, don't.

237
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,828
So this charming piece
is in three acts.

238
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,033
It begins with
Edgardo leaving for France

239
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,397
to renew his vow of love for Lucia.

240
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,515
Though both houses
have maintained a feud for years.

241
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,796
Enrico, Lucia's brother,
arranges a marriage

242
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,155
between his friend Arturo and Lucia

243
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,478
by tricking her into believing
that Edgardo has been untrue.

244
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,671
But let's watch.

245
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,672
The maestro.

246
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,830
Wasn't that lovely?

247
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,595
Good night. Good night.

248
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,909
So how'd it go?

249
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,674
Well, I had a problem
with one of the customers.

250
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,031
- Oh, yeah, what?
- He refused to keep his hands on me.

251
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,432
- Go home. I'll finish up here.
- Thanks.

252
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,828
Yeah.

253
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,195
Diane, you probably noticed
I wasn't there tonight.

254
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,798
Oh, yes. Thank you, Carla.

255
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,513
- It was a really sweet gesture.
- You're welcome.

256
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,913
- May I offer you a cognac?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

257
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,273
Thank you again, Sam,
for your thoughtfulness.

258
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,917
It may not seem like much to you,
but it really meant a lot to me.

259
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,510
No, no, it seemed like
quite a bit to us too.

260
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,158
This evening was so special,
so wonderful to me.

261
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,918
And it was all your doing.

262
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,879
Well, there were
some other people involved.

263
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,589
Oh, no, you're their leader.
They do nothing without you.

264
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,433
- Well...
- But so gallant.

265
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,673
Well, thank you.
I can't help helping, I guess.

266
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,233
Every detail was so well-thought-out,
right down to your choice of opera.

267
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,592
Oh, well, I knew that
Lucy...was your favourite.

268
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,350
It was perfect.
You hit all the right chords.

269
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,950
Well, I think I know you
pretty well by now.

270
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,997
Sam, I confess,
I underestimated you.

271
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,789
I had no idea you thought so much
about me in ways other than sexual.

272
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,393
Unfortunately, I can't possibly
do that at the moment.

273
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,034
Oh, Sam.

274
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,914
You moved me very deeply tonight.

275
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,317
Well, it moves me deeply
to move you deeply.

276
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,473
Speaking of depths,
would I be sinking to one

277
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,111
if I were to suggest that we carry
this conversation back to my place?

278
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,395
- Sam, my God.
- Oh, dear, what?

279
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,036
I wasn't expecting this.

280
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,437
I'm experiencing emotions
I haven't felt for so long.

281
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,989
My heart's saying yes,
my mind's saying no.

282
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,432
Well, why don't you let some other
part of your body break the tie for you?

283
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,236
I think I'd better go.

284
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,910
My purse.

285
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,232
Oh, boy.

286
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,871
Oh, Sam, I can't fight it.

287
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,072
Everything tonight has been
leading me right into your arms.

288
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,549
Let me get this clear here.
You're saying that we--

289
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,278
We always get into
so much trouble when we talk.

290
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,119
Let's not. Let's just do.

291
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,596
From now on, no words.

292
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,639
I can't believe this.
This is like a dream I had once.

293
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,033
- This was good back here.
- Yeah, it was.

294
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,155
This is becoming the most perfect
evening we've ever had together.

295
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,276
Oh, boy.

296
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,072
Sam?

297
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,115
- What is it?
- Oh, l--

298
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,471
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

299
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,558
I gotta be honest with you.

300
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,358
Frasier planned the whole evening.
I had nothing to do with it.

301
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,873
What do you think about that?

302
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,157
Now...

303
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,354
Your saying this to me now

304
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,479
is one of the most wonderful things
you have ever done.

305
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,589
Oh, boy.

306
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,273
I'm even more attracted to you now
than before.

307
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,869
Oh, that's great.
Oh, that's great. Let's go.

308
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,032
- Sam, wait.
- No, no, don't say wait. Don't say wait.

309
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,916
- We can't possibly have sex tonight.
- Sure we can. Sure we can.

310
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,833
No, don't you realize what you did?
You insisted on being honest to me.

311
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,558
Respecting me as a person.

312
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,510
Even though it meant risking
the loss of a night of passion.

313
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,998
Yeah, well, that kind of stuff should be
rewarded, you know?

314
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,954
Sam, you know,
for a change, tonight

315
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,510
you had the cooler head,
and you were right to stop me.

316
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,071
We are developing
a very special relationship,

317
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,556
and it would be wrong
to jeopardize it by having sex.

318
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,312
No. I want to jeopardize it with sex.

319
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,910
- It would be a test.
- Sam. Sam, we're regressing.

320
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,556
You're backsliding.
We're not ready yet.

321
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,038
Well, do you have an estimate
on when we might be ready?

322
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,599
I mean, is it minutes here?
Come on.

323
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,399
Sam, this was
a real breakthrough for us.

324
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,797
I think it's very important
for each of us to be alone.

325
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,913
No, I agree. As soon as we're done,
I'll leave. I promise.

326
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,879
- Good night, Sam.
