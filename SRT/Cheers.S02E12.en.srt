1
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:05,753
WHERE THERE'S A WILL

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,132
They need me at the branch office
to heIp handIe the hoIiday deIuge.

3
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:15,471
Terrific, and now this.
My coat's underneath this mess.

4
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:20,393
Come on up here and get your jackets.
This is officiaI government business.

5
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:24,605
Got it, Sam.

6
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:27,149
Stand back. I'm going in.

7
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:35,324
I'II find you...

8
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,882
- This is obviousIy not my...
- Put it on or I tear off your cIothes.

9
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:54,635
Yes, ma'am. Yes, God bIess you, CarIa.

10
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:00,683
At Ieast dogs won't attack their own.

11
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,636
AIIow me.

12
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,096
Thank you.

13
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:24,975
Watch this.

14
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,230
- How do you not burn your hand?
- I don't.

15
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:36,528
Show her some of the other tricks.

16
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:40,824
- You know a Iot of tricks, do you?
- Yeah, I know my share.

17
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:45,204
Show her the one about
the disappearing girIfriend.

18
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:48,290
You'II Iike this one. Watch this.

19
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,387
WeIcome to Cheers.
What can I get you?

20
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:05,975
- What's your bartender's speciaIty?
- He's got hot buttered rum going.

21
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:11,188
Sounds good. Make it a doubIe.
I've just had the worst day of my Iife.

22
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:15,818
You know what I aIways say?
Life is Iike a Chinese banquet.

23
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:19,029
Between the Peking duck
and the sweet and sour fish,

24
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:21,532
you have to expect chicken feet soup.

25
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,575
So Iaugh.

26
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:28,747
I've just been toId
I have six months to Iive.

27
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,547
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,800
I didn't mean to be facetious.
I'm terribIy sorry.

29
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:44,263
- I went on and on Iike a ninny.
- Hey, can I get you something?

30
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:50,352
Sammy, how do you do this trick?
That one.

31
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,481
It's aII in your mind. Think about
the most pIeasant thing in your Iife.

32
00:03:55,607 --> 00:04:00,154
Being burned by this wouId be
the most pIeasant thing in my Iife.

33
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,204
- You have to taIk to that man there.
- Why?

34
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:14,668
He came in here because he just
found out he's got six months to Iive.

35
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:17,671
That's not just an opening Iine?

36
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,386
What kind of a reptiIe
wouId say that as a sexuaI overture?

37
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:29,141
Nobody. I mean, not me, that's for sure.

38
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:36,482
- He seems to want to taIk about it.
- I'II taIk to him.

39
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:40,777
How do you cheer someone up
who's got six months to Iive?

40
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:43,739
I'II teII him I have five.

41
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,742
- What's he drinking?
- Hot buttered rum.

42
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,870
Hey, everybody, now watch this.

43
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:57,336
Hey, way to go, Coach. You did it.
You must have a high threshoId of pain.

44
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,839
- I don't know the meaning of the word.
- Pretty tough guy.

45
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:04,051
No, he doesn't know
what ''threshoId'' means.

46
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,640
Thanks, Normie.

47
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:13,977
Hi, can I join you? My name's Sam
MaIone. I'm the owner of the bar.

48
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,188
- MaIcoIm Kramer.
- How do you do?

49
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:20,150
Before I retired I owned a chemicaI pIant
outside of Chicago.

50
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:26,323
This may be none of my business
but have you got a second opinion?

51
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,494
- Doctors make mistakes.
- Every doctor says the same thing

52
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:34,206
and I've been to tweIve
Ieading speciaIists.

53
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:38,961
Maybe you'd get better news
if you went to a quack.

54
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,590
- How's your drink?
- ExceIIent. You're a good bartender.

55
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,429
They sound as if
they're having a good time.

56
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:54,101
I worked my way through Harvard
tending bar. The best years of my Iife.

57
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,312
Do you think you've stiII got the touch?

58
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,066
- You mean it?
- Why not? Come on.

59
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,736
We've onIy got two ruIes -
no empty gIasses on the bar

60
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:09,032
and if somebody beIches,
bIame a waitress.

61
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:33,640
He did it! What am I yeIIing about?
I bet against him.

62
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:37,477
- Thank you very much.
- You never Iose it.

63
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:43,191
This guy's terrific.

64
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:46,778
He's a great storyteIIer
and he knows what he's doing.

65
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:50,657
We shouId have an oIder guy behind
the bar. The customers Iike it.

66
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:54,286
- What about you, Coach?
- I'd Iike it, too.

67
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:57,080
- I'II think about it.
- Thanks, Sam.

68
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:00,542
We're Iow on beer mugs.
Can someone wash these?

69
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,336
- I'd Iove to.
- You Iike washing gIasses?

70
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,548
You bet. I feeI Iike
an 1 8-year-oId coIIege boy.

71
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:09,885
Me, too. See one around?

72
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:12,679
You're on, cutie.

73
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:18,560
- About time you got back.
- What's the big deaI?

74
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:21,730
The wind shot right through that oId thing.

75
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,568
And those Lifesavers had to be
at Ieast a year oId.

76
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:33,325
If Boston ever knew how cIose it came
to a catastrophe, there'd be panic.

77
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,703
Kramer, that's CIiff. Give him a beer.

78
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,081
That's Mr Kramer. He's a customer.

79
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:44,544
I'd rather have my potabIes prepared
by a competent mixoIogist.

80
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:48,757
Be a IittIe sensitive.
Sam's Ietting him do this as a favour.

81
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:52,719
Doc says he's going beIIy-up
in a few months.

82
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:58,141
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Those are the breaks, huh?

83
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:02,854
Mr Kramer, you wanted me to teII you
when it was 1 1 :00.

84
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:06,608
- I've got a pIane to catch.
- You're reaIIy gonna Ieave?

85
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:13,198
Yes. I don't want them to caII me ''the
Iate MaIcoIm Kramer'' before it's officiaI.

86
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:18,662
- Thank you, Sam.
- Anytime, MaIcoIm.

87
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:22,374
- Listen, you come back before...
- Soon.

88
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,001
Come back reaI soon.

89
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:28,588
Goodnight, everybody. And thank you.

90
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:32,008
I've had a wonderfuI time
just when I needed it.

91
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:37,597
Someday I hope you'II appreciate
how much I reaIIy did enjoy it.

92
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,561
- Goodbye, Mr Kramer.
- Now that's a nice guy.

93
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:47,941
Thanks, Norm. My pop aIways toId me
to say goodbye.

94
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,990
Excuse me.

95
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:58,952
What you peopIe did this evening
was magnificent.

96
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:05,375
It strengthened in me a faith in humanity
that gets a IittIe shaky at times.

97
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:09,671
I want you aII to know that there's
nothing that I wouIdn't do for any of you.

98
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:13,925
- Hot dog!
- Drop the skivvies and dance!

99
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:18,263
Maggots!

100
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:27,439
Who's the wise guy who shoved
the I.O.U. in the tip gIass?

101
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:31,067
Let me see this. It's not an I.O.U.

102
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:35,572
This is...a bunch of writing
I don't understand.

103
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,575
- Is it in a foreign tongue?
- No, it's EngIish.

104
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:42,037
In your case, that quaIifies.

105
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,669
''To Whom It May Concern.

106
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:55,467
''PIease be advised that herewith
I amend my wiII to provide the foIIowing...

107
00:09:55,633 --> 00:10:00,388
''As a token for their kindness,
I Ieave the sum of...

108
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:04,851
''$1 00,000 to the gang at Cheers,
signed MaIcoIm Kramer.''

109
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,313
Is this a joke?

110
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,858
CIiff, check that out. See if it's vaIid.

111
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,325
I don't want to pronounce judgment
too hastiIy,

112
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:25,538
but I think there is a precedent
in the case of Penoyer versus Neff,

113
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:30,502
when it was found that jurisprudence
is the better part of diction.

114
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,883
- Tom, you're a Iawyer, aren't you?
- I work for Singer and FIeckman.

115
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,220
Take a Iook at this.
TeII me what it means.

116
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,517
His intent here
was to have everybody at Cheers

117
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,727
spIit up $1 00,000 when he dies.

118
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:51,940
I heard him say he was rich,
but I thought it was a Iine.

119
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:55,944
- Sam, who wouId use a Iine Iike that?
- Not me.

120
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,906
1 00 grand.
What does that come out to each?

121
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,451
Looks Iike approximateIy $2,500.

122
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:06,538
Minus my accounting fee,
that's a 1 00 bucks.

123
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:10,542
- We each get a 1 00 bucks?
- No, you spIit a 1 00 bucks.

124
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:15,296
Wait a minute. It doesn't say anything
about dividing it equaIIy.

125
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:19,759
A Iot of these peopIe
didn't give the guy the time of day.

126
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:24,889
Wait a minute!
It doesn't matter anyway.

127
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:27,350
This paper is worthIess.

128
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:31,354
In order for a wiII to be vaIid
according to Massachusetts Iaw,

129
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:34,107
the stipuIations must be precise

130
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:38,444
and the document signed by
three witnesses, which this isn't.

131
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:44,659
Come on. It's a beautifuI souvenir of
an evening of generosity and goodwiII.

132
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,787
To heII with that! I want my money!
Money!

133
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:55,670
Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea here.

134
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:59,590
If we can bring him back,
we couId get him to write a vaIid wiII

135
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:03,344
and then he can stipuIate
who he wants to get how much.

136
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:06,389
Sure. He's on his way to the airport.

137
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:09,434
- Catch him at the hoteI.
- I'II go get him.

138
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,686
- Why you?
- He Iiked me best.

139
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:15,606
- Yeah? What makes you think so?
- He embraced me.

140
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:17,817
We never saw that.

141
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:20,361
It wasn't an overt embrace.

142
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:23,990
It was more Iike we hugged
with our eyes.

143
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:31,497
Whoever goes is gonna have
an opportunity at sweet-taIking the guy,

144
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:35,460
so we better
send somebody that we aII trust.

145
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,670
AbsoIuteIy. OK, I'II go.

146
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:41,299
You'd shoot your mother
in the back for two bits.

147
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:47,013
- My mother's a saint!
- Send Coach. You aII trust Coach.

148
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,682
OK, here I go.

149
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,602
I'm with it.

150
00:12:56,147 --> 00:13:00,234
PIay it cooI. We don't want to
appear too eager and scare the guy off.

151
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:04,322
TeII him his adopted son Norm
sends his Iove.

152
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:07,825
I want aII you guys to know

153
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:11,579
that it's a priviIege
that you picked me for this job

154
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:15,833
and I hope I can answer
your expectations.

155
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,883
What were your expectations?

156
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:36,743
Coach has been gone an hour.
I wonder what he's up to.

157
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:42,832
OK, Sammy, this is it! This wiII satisfy
the CommonweaIth of Massachusetts

158
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:47,837
and aII we need is Kramer's signature
and three witnesses and we got it.

159
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:51,674
Don't think you're gonna get a bigger cut.

160
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:56,637
Listen. On behaIf of the federaI
government, I'd better take a Iook at this.

161
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:02,143
You misspeIIed Massachusetts,
first of aII.

162
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,647
On the face of it, this is aII prima facie
non corpus interruptus anyhow.

163
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:10,818
You're wasting our time. This guy!

164
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:14,197
- What kind of Iawyer are you?
- You wouIdn't know.

165
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:16,407
Try me, Raymond Burr-brain.

166
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm not actuaIIy an attorney yet. I'm
gonna take my bar exam next month.

167
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:28,044
- The guy's here on faIse pretences.
- Let's boot him out in the snow!

168
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,050
Hey, come on! Whoa! Take it easy!

169
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,344
This is getting crazy. SettIe down.

170
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,931
- They're back!
- Hooray for Mr Kramer!

171
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,361
What took you so Iong, Coach?

172
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,863
I had to dig the car out...

173
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,534
- Why didn't you just take a cab?
- It wasn't worth it.

174
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,537
The hoteI's onIy a bIock away.

175
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:06,082
I want you to say heIIo
to my best friend, Mr Kramer.

176
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:08,459
There's some probIem about my wiII?

177
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:12,546
Mr Kramer, you made a wonderfuI
gesture to these peopIe

178
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,757
and now they're asking you to repeat it.

179
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:17,760
You do that to me every night.

180
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:23,140
I'm waiting for you to get it right.

181
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:28,396
Mr Kramer, it was a wonderfuI gesture

182
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:32,400
but you didn't teII us
how you wanted us to spIit it up.

183
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:36,279
You see, what we got here
is a reaI probIem.

184
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:42,868
Who gets what? These bozos
or my five precious chiIdren.

185
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:49,000
Posing for this picture is the Iongest
they've ever stood without crutches.

186
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:55,339
PeddIe those monsters somewhere eIse.
It's tonight that counts.

187
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:58,759
Remember those times we had
standing over there?

188
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:04,557
How can you ever forget that deIightfuI
waIk you and I took over to the jukebox?

189
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:07,977
You turned to me
when you wanted to know the time.

190
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:11,981
- You didn't teII me.
- What am I, Big Ben?

191
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:18,404
Why don't you just give
aII your money to your reIatives?

192
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:22,158
I don't have any cIose reIatives.

193
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:25,536
- You do now, Mervyn.
- My name is MaIcoIm.

194
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:31,042
May I caII you Mervyn?
That was my father's name.

195
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,213
Mr Kramer, you couId
give this money to charity.

196
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,050
Hey, I am charity. Beat it!

197
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:46,682
I don't have time to deaI with this.
Life's too short. I have a pIane to catch.

198
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:51,729
I'm gonna sign the money aII over to you.
You can divide it as you see fit.

199
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:53,939
- No...
- Sorry. I've got to run.

200
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:58,027
Goodbye, everybody. Goodnight.
And thanks again.

201
00:16:58,194 --> 00:17:02,698
- Goodnight, Mr Kramer.
- Yeah, don't be a stranger.

202
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,912
Come on, wouId you? Stop it.

203
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,624
Now I'm gonna try to divide this up
fair and square,

204
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,543
but no appeaIs
to friendship and sentiment

205
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,754
and none of that kissy-kissy stuff.

206
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:21,592
How much evidence do you need?
Does there have to be bIood shed?

207
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,136
- Destroy the wiII.
- Let's kiII her!

208
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:33,646
- What's it gonna be?
- Yeah, waIk Iike a man.

209
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:40,110
Everybody in this room right now
gets an equaI share and that's it.

210
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,953
What are you doing?

211
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:55,918
Now it's over. It's done.

212
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:58,379
Everybody get back to normaI.

213
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,807
We shouId have kiIIed her
when we had the chance.

214
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:14,812
- I hope it taught you a Iesson.
- About not being greedy about money?

215
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:18,774
No, aIways dispose
of fIaming materiaIs properIy.

216
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:24,613
We shouId have known. Guys Iike us
don't get that kind of money.

217
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,994
WeII, we're no poorer now than we were
when we came in here tonight.

218
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,788
You can taIk. You're gonna be a Iawyer.

219
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:36,875
- But a bad one.
- Wanna give me a break?

220
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:40,879
Cheers is Cheers again
and I'm reIieved.

221
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:45,592
I'm going to go thank Sam
and aII of you shouId, too.

222
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:50,306
And, by the way,
with aII the insanity about the wiII,

223
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:52,641
no-one said a word about my hairdo.

224
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:57,896
- It stinks.
- There. Now was that so hard?

225
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:08,032
What you did out there was fine
and nobIe and I'm very proud of you.

226
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:13,704
And I can teII by that Iook
you're proud of yourseIf.

227
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:18,167
Yes, Diane, I am. I'm proud and...

228
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:20,836
rich.

229
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:30,596
- What's that?
- This baby is my ticket to happiness.

230
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,515
This is the wiII. I burned the phoney one.

231
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,726
What? How?

232
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:39,271
Are you kidding me?
I do magic, remember?

233
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,940
Watch this.

234
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,533
Oh, Iookee here!

235
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,578
That is the most avaricious,

236
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:58,957
unregenerate, rapacious thing
you have ever done!

237
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:03,837
Wait. A coupIe of those words
didn't sound very nice.

238
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,423
How's this? You have sunk so Iow

239
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,219
you wouId need a Iadder
to kiss a snake's hinie.

240
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:15,599
That's cIear, but why?
I thought it was pretty good.

241
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:19,269
I saw those peopIe
going at each other's throats.

242
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:22,147
This was the best possibIe soIution.

243
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,400
Come on, Iook at it IogicaIIy.

244
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:29,112
How are you going to expIain
your new-found riches to them?

245
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,408
Give me a IittIe credit here. I won't
change my IifestyIe aII of a sudden.

246
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,829
My purchases wiII be simpIe.

247
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:42,042
TeIevision, maybe. A pair of shoes.
A coupIe pairs of pants.

248
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,879
Trip to the Canaries
in my brand new 60-foot yacht.

249
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:54,721
I know what you're worried about.
Hey, come on. You're my sweetie.

250
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:59,977
I'II spIit the money with you. Think about
aII the good you can do with it.

251
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,855
What good couId come of this?

252
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:06,525
Charities.

253
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,779
I suppose one couId do wonders

254
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:14,408
with a Iot of money,
if one were so incIined.

255
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,536
I couId donate
to environmentaI charities.

256
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:21,415
Fight worId hunger,
save endangered species,

257
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:24,918
and grab up that fabuIous siIk dress
at CIaudine's.

258
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:29,339
- Yes!
- Oh, no! Now I'm doing it!

259
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:33,635
- I won't Iet you do this to your friends!
- What are you gonna do? Rat on me?

260
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,350
Wait a second!
This is what we're taIking about here.

261
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:44,730
- You're crazy.
- I may be crazy but I'm not stupid.

262
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:47,816
- You're very stupid.
- I'II teII you how stupid I am.

263
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,694
I see through you Iike a book.

264
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:53,238
Ah, that stupid.

265
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:55,699
You want my money.

266
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:59,745
What are you gonna do?
You gonna bIackmaiI me for it?

267
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:04,249
You just Iost your boat ride, baby.

268
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,795
You can't sIap me. I'm a rich guy.

269
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:13,008
How Iong are you
gonna keep doing this?

270
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:16,928
I don't know you. I've never seen you
Iike this and I don't Iike it.

271
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:22,351
Don't Iet this come between us.
I want you to heIp me spend the money.

272
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:25,562
- It wiII make us happy.
- It's making me miserabIe.

273
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:28,690
Wait tiII you see the fun we have
on that boat!

274
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:33,362
If that guy wouId kick off in four months,
we couId have that baby by spring!

275
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:38,658
- Did you hear what you just said?
- Oh, my...God.

276
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:42,037
That was a horribIe thing to say,
wasn't it?

277
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:46,917
Six months wouId be fine.
We couId catch the GuIf Stream.

278
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:51,338
What's happening to me?
I'm turning into a horribIe person.

279
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,715
Yes, you are.

280
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,555
I'm gonna do what I shouId have done
when I set eyes on this.

281
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:04,142
I'm gonna destroy it
before it destroys me.

282
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,818
That was the right thing to do.

283
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:16,113
Now Iet's forget
that any of this ever happened.

284
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,573
Yes, Iet's.

285
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:33,255
I hate myseIf for what I just thought.

286
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:38,260
No, I won't even say it.

287
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:44,349
I know you didn't...
but Iet me know better.

288
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:48,311
Come on. Do you think
I wouId do something Iike that again

289
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:51,314
after what I just went through?

290
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:55,235
I'm sorry. Of course not.

291
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,779
Any person who wouId do that

292
00:23:57,946 --> 00:24:02,993
wouId have guiIt eating away
at his guts for the rest of his Iife.

293
00:24:03,702 --> 00:24:05,704
Thank you.

294
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:20,468
I hate her.

295
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:24,014
I reaIIy, reaIIy do.
I hate her so much.
