    Cheers <i>is filmed before</i>     
     <i>a live studio audience.</i>    

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Oh, Knight                      
of the Pentacles.               

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,300
I wouldn't want to be in        
your shoes, Mr. Petersen.       

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,000
Woody, are those                
Tarot cards?                    

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,600
            Yeah.               

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,000
What are you doing?             

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,900
You have to be careful          
with those things.              

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,900
 Ah, yes, the awesome power and 
 dreaded prophecy of the Tarot. 

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
So ancient and mysterious       

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,900
 that no one knows its history, 
          not even me.          

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
          Well, that's a relief.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,200
Woody, you idiot.               

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,400
Don't mess with                 
the supernatural.               

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,900
Have I taught you               
nothing about bad juju?         

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,200
         Relax, Carla.          
     I've done this before.     

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,300
      Now, where were we,       
         Mr. Petersen?          

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,000
                Have you got any
                Grim Reapers?   

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,200
    Nope. Go fish.              

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,000
      (theme song begins)       

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,200
     Making your way           
      in the world today       

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
 Takes everything you've got  

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,100
         Takin' a break        
    from all your worries      

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,000
 Sure would help a lot         

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,700
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
   Sometimes you want to go    

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,800
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,500
       And they're always      
        glad you came          

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
          You wanna be         
      where you can see        

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,500
          The troubles         
    are all the same           

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,500
  You wanna be where everybody 
    knows your name            

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
          You wanna go         
      where people know        

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,800
   People are all the same     

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
  You wanna go where everybody 
    knows your name.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,200
      (loud jackhammering)      

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,900
                     (shouting):
            Carla, can I have   
                 a beer, please?

37
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,300
(shouting):                     
What?                           

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
    (shouting louder):          
  Can I have a beer, please?1   

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,700
    (shouting louder):          
             What?!             

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,700
         (noise stops)          
             Ca...              

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,100
        (normal voice):         
Can I have a beer, please?      

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,300
          (shouting):           
             What?!             

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,100
        They stopped the        
        hammering, okay?        

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,600
          (shouting):           
I know, I'm just torturing you! 

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
        Finally stopped, huh?   
                It must be noon.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,100
Actually, I've only             
got ten till.                   

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,300
     Oh, yeah, union guys.      

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,600
              Yep.              

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,400
      When are those guys       
    gonna be finished?          

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
 They're killing our business.  

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Nobody can come                 
through the front door.         

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
              That's okay.      

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,100
         The foreman promised me
it's just a one-day job, hon.   

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,400
    I hope so.                  

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
      What are they doing       
        up there anyway?        

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why doesn't                     
someone go see?                 

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,200
          Well, it's all the way
             upstairs, you know.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,600
                  Maybe we could
                  call somebody.

59
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,300
Yeah, the phone's               
way over there.                 

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,900
        We could turn on the TV.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
         It might be on the news
                or something.   

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,100
Clicker's in the poolroom.      

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
                Well, I guess   
            we'll never know.   

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,300
If you people aren't the laziest
 beer sponges I have ever seen. 

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,600
I mean, if you want             

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,900
    to know what's going on     
        out there,              

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,500
      why doesn't somebody      
          go and look?          

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
Why doesn't somebody just get up

69
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,700
     off their rusty-dusty      
          and go look?          

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,200
  Oh, hey, maybe I should have  
asked him to return this.       

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,900
(Frasier yelling)               
(loud crash)                    

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
         Oh, too late.          

73
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,500
Maybe we should go see          
if he's all right.              

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,600
            Aw, it's all the way
             upstairs, you know.

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,900
                    So, Fras,   

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,300
 what are they doing up there?  

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
  Well, as near as I can tell,  

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,800
 they're replacing the top step 
     with a six-foot hole.      

79
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
        (laughing)              

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,800
You know, you people wouldn't   
be laughing if you knew that    
I have a severe dust allergy.   

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
    (laughing harder)           

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
          I'm serious.          

83
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,600
      I could have fallen       
      and broken my neck.       

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,100
        Stop, Dr. Crane.        

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
    Let me catch my breath.     

86
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,800
Hey, there's the guy            
who took the header             

87
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,700
into our ditch.                 

88
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,400
                  Hey, why'd you
                do that, man?   

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
  You almost broke your neck.   

90
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,000
  Hey, don't get him started.   

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
  He's got this whole routine.  

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,300
      Can I help you guys?      

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah, you can help us out       
with a couple of beers.         

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,700
    That'll be five dollars.    

95
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
         Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

96
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
We can't have our boys in the   
    trenches paying for this.   

97
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,500
         No-no, much better they
    spend their valuable time   

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,700
                 finishing their
                work upstairs   

99
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,500
    than digging around in their
wallets for the exact change.   

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
            Now, here's a man   
             who understands the
          construction business.

101
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
What are you doing?             

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,300
                What am I doing?

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
                I'm greasing the
        construction workers.   

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,900
        Ooh, that'd make a great
     title for my autobiography.

105
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,300
This is disgusting.             

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
                What?           

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,100
Bribing those men               
to do their job?                

108
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,800
What happened to an honest day's
work for an honest day's pay?   

109
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,700
    (Frasier laughing)          

110
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,000
             Now, that is funny.
                      (laughing)

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Nothing will top the one        
about you breaking your neck.   

112
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,100
    It's all in the delivery.   

113
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,600
    Excuse me, uh, that was     
  a very nice gesture of Sam,   

114
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,300
    but I'm the manager here,   

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,100
            and I am responsible
        for receiving payment   

116
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
     for services rendered.     

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,100
          Honey, honey, don't...

118
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,000
          No, no, no, the lady's
            got the right idea--

119
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,800
        pride in workmanship.   

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,100
         You have inspired us to
        go out and do our job   
              as well as we can,

121
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,800
no matter how                   
long it takes.                  

122
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,300
After all, we're craftsmen.     

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,200
            You see?            

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
    Well, that was Ma.          

125
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,300
    Her flight got in           
      a little bit early,       

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
 and, uh, she'll be by as soon  
      as she grabs a cab.       

127
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,000
             Your mom's in town?
             Yeah.              

128
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
                Why don't you go
                    pick her up?

129
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Oh, Normie, that would set      
     exactly the wrong tone     

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,900
        for this visit.         

131
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,200
    You know why she's here.    

132
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
She wants to move back in       
            with me.            

133
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, she can just              
forget it, I tell you.          

134
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,200
She's not gonna be running      
my life like she did            

135
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,400
when I was in my mid-30s,       
no, sirree, sir.                

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
No-no. I'm a new                
Cliff Clavin, new man.          

137
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh, hey, yeah,                  
I'd be happy to see her.        

138
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,200
I'd take her out to dinner,     
give her a perm,                

139
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,000
but that's about it.            

140
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,600
  I don't get it, Mr. Clavin.   

141
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
I thought you liked your mom... 
             a lot.             

142
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,300
                    A whole lot.

143
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,300
Too much to be healthy, really. 

144
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,200
        Why don't I hear        
    any jackhammering?          

145
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I don't know.                   

146
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Why don't you, uh, go on        
up there and find out           

147
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,800
what they're doing              
and come back and let us know?  

148
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,000
         Right, Carla.          

149
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,400
 And then I would probably fall 
    in a hole or something.     

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,900
    What do you think           
        I am, an idiot?         

151
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,100
             We prefer the term,
                 hapless victim.

152
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,500
  I'll tell you why you don't   
    hear any jackhammering.     

153
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,600
        They're pulling         
      a slowdown up there.      

154
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,700
WORKER:                         
Good heavens. I laced           
my boot incorrectly.            

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
I'll have to start              
all over again.                 

156
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,800
        Oh, man, this is        
        making me crazy.        

157
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,200
     They're gonna be here      
          for a month.          

158
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,900
Look, I'm sorry, Rebecca.       

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,300
                 You gotta go up
            and give that guy   
            this $50 he dropped.

160
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,100
As a matter of fact,            
I think they both               
dropped $50. There.             

161
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
                No, Sam, I'm not
                  gonna do this.

162
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,900
                You cannot bribe
                      those men.

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
                It's a matter   
                of principle.   

164
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,300
    Rebecca, it's like          

165
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
    the cardinal rule           
 of the free enterprise system. 

166
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,400
  You pay somebody more money,  
    they work faster.           

167
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,600
    Hey, look at this.          

168
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,300
     We're getting a raise      
      at the post office.       

169
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,700
              The exception that
                proves the rule.

170
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
No, you see...                  

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,300
        Sam, no, no, you made   
                 me the manager.

172
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
    You gave me the authority   
    to handle these problems.   

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,600
            So let me just do   
                  it my own way.

174
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay, Manager,                  
what are you gonna do?          

175
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,700
Well, I think we'll just make   
  an entrance through the alley.

176
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,900
 Oh, you've got to be kidding.  

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,800
     What are you gonna do,     
    bust a hole in my wall?     

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
                        NORM:   
            Well, actually, Sam,

179
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
     you know that window,      
the leaded stained glass window 

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
  is in a single wooden frame,  
so I think you could pop it out 

181
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,500
 fairly easily with a crowbar.  

182
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
     I think the opening's      
      like four by eight,       

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,200
    which is perfectly good     
    for a standard entrance.    

184
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,500
  You build a little staircase  

185
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
    and you've got yourself     
     a nice little doorway.     

186
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,500
     Well, you've put a lot     
     of thought into this.      

187
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
It's always been a dream of mine

188
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,800
  to someday retire and build   
 a little apartment back there. 

189
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,500
        Hello, Clifford.        

190
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
      Hey, Ma! Hey, look.       

191
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,600
             Come on here.      
                 Ah...          

192
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
            (chuckling)         

193
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,000
My, everybody has               
filled out nicely.              

194
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,000
         Well, say, Mrs. Clavin,
    if you don't mind my asking,

195
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,400
    uh, how did you, happen     
     to negotiate that hole     

196
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,300
  up at the top of the stairs?  

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, I just hiked up my skirt    
and hopped across.              

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,100
No big deal.                    

199
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Although those                  
construction boys told me       

200
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
some jackass                    
actually fell in.               

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,100
Can you believe that?           

202
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,500
            (laughs)            

203
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm a boob. I'm a big, fat boob.

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,700
             CLIFF:             
          So, uh, Ma,           

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,500
what made you decide to blow    
into town all of a sudden?      

206
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,300
                Well you know   
                how much I enjoy

207
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,500
        the historically rich   
            sport of dog racing.

208
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
Who doesn't?                    

209
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,900
      It turned out I enjoyed it
     a bit too much last Friday,

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
    and, uh, let's just say I   
     owe some people some money.

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
                    Whoops.     

212
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,700
      Well, the dog I put all my
        money on, apparently had
          a parasitic condition.

213
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,100
                  He scooted the
                  last 75 yards.

214
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,900
    He got the most laughs,     

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
              but they don't pay
                      on laughs.

216
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,200
             Anyway, it gives me

217
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,600
            a chance to catch up
             with my little boy.

218
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
          I'm looking forward to
        seeing what you're doing

219
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,900
    with your life and how we   
         can go about fixing it.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,400
I, uh, appreciate               
the thought, Ma,                

221
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
but, I don't have anything      
that needs fixing.              

222
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
See, I, uh, I've got            
a new lifestyle.                

223
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,700
I, uh, I like it.               

224
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
          Clifford, is it really
                a new lifestyle,

225
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,700
         or is it just an excuse

226
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,500
             to walk around your
        apartment half naked?   

227
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,100
It's, uh, not an                
either-or situation, Ma.        

228
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,200
    I suppose there's no room in
    this playboy pad of yours   

229
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,000
          for somebody's mother?

230
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,700
Thank you for, uh, being        
so understanding, Ma.           

231
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,300
                      Oh.       

232
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,800
 Well, I certainly don't want to
be a burden to you, Clifford.   

233
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
                  Lord knows you
          weren't a burden to me

234
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
             when I was in labor
          with you for 72 hours.

235
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,900
                 Whoa. 72 hours?

236
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,000
         He had those wide hips.

237
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
I got you                       
a great hotel here.             

238
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,800
Look, it's got HBO...           
                You shouldn't go
                to that expense.

239
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
        All I need is a large   
            appliance carton,   

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,800
              and I can sleep on
                the street...   

241
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,700
              with all the other
              forgotten mothers.

242
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
     You can stay with me.      

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,300
Are you sure you don't have a   
  lifestyle I'd be intruding on?

244
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,900
      Not that I know of.       

245
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,900
                  Well, then I'd
                     be glad to.

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,200
            What's your name?   

247
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,400
             Woody.             
                          Woody.

248
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,300
    Oh, that's the name of a boy
  whose mother raised him right.

249
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
            Really?             

250
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,900
 'Cause I looked it up and all  
  I could find was "treelike."  

251
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,300
  Well, let's get you settled   
      in, huh, Mrs. Cla...      

252
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,500
No, no, hey, hey, Woody,        

253
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,300
my mother doesn't want          
to impose on anybody.           

254
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,700
Oh, suddenly he's an            
expert on my desires.           

255
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,500
I certainly do want             
to stay with Woody.             

256
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
    I like him.                 

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,700
He's sweet and thoughtful, and  
look at those nice, narrow hips.

258
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll bet you shot out           
like a bullet.                  

259
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,300
          Well, Norm's          
      got the window out.       

260
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,800
      Now he's starting on      
         the iron bars.         

261
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,600
             When he's finished,
            anybody who wants to

262
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,200
          can come into this bar

263
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,700
    right through that alley.   

264
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
        (barking)               

265
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,200
    What was that?              

266
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
      Two big dogs chasing      
          a Chihuahua.          

267
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
        At least I think        
      it was a Chihuahua.       

268
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,800
If the health department        
asks, it was a Chihuahua.       

269
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
            Thanks for giving me
              a lift, Ma Clavin.

270
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,400
My pleasure, Woody.             

271
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,500
Here's your lunch.              

272
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,100
I cut the grapes in half,       

273
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,500
but should one lodge            
in your esophagus,              

274
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,000
remember the international      
sign for choking is this.       

275
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,400
     Uh, how come you never     
      taught me that, Ma?       

276
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,700
Oh, Clifford.                   

277
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,200
With that windpipe of yours,    

278
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
it would take a knockwurst      
to cut off your air.            

279
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,300
     I'll be home at 7:00.      

280
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't be late.                  

281
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,900
I'm stopping at                 
the video store                 

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
to pick up the rest of          
the <i>Police Academy</i> cycle.       

283
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
                        Ah...   
    Oh,                         

284
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,800
I love that handsome,           
young African American          

285
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,100
who makes those                 
funny noises with his mouth.    

286
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
             Yeah, he's a hoot, 
                 isn't he?      

287
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,600
Yes, he is.                     

288
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,200
And you can tell                
by watching him                 

289
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,900
he's very respectful            
to his mother.                  

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,700
          Ma, are you mad at me?

291
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
I'd have to care to be mad.     

292
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,100
          Look, Ma, I didn't say

293
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,500
    I never wanted to see you   
     again, for crying out loud.

294
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,400
            Listen, why don't   
                you come over   

295
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
                and we watch uh,
          <i>Jeopardy</i> tonight, huh?

296
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
            Just come on over   
            to the apartment.   

297
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh, praise God, I've            
been invited to Xanadu.         

298
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Actually, Clifford, I happen    
to have a previous engagement.  

299
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,100
          (inaudible whispering)
No... no... no... no.           

300
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Oh, all right.                  

301
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,400
Clifford, we'd be delighted     

302
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,200
 to have you join us for        
 <i>Police Academy</i> tonight.        

303
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,600
        Oh, no, that's okay, Ma.

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
        I'm just gonna have a   
          lot of fun right here.

305
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,400
         I'm as happy as a lark.

306
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
                 Well, actually,
                     Mr. Clavin,

307
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
              the lark is a very
                 depressed bird.

308
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,000
                It has one of   
                     the highest

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,200
     suicide rates in the entire
         ornithological kingdom.

310
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
        Interestingly enough,   
                     its song...

311
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300
          ...is more of a dirge.
             Is more of a dirge.

312
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,800
        You've been teaching him
bird trivia, haven't you, Ma?   

313
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,000
Woody is the best student       
I've had, bar none.             

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,800
          Huh. I know what      
      you're trying to do, Ma,  
    and it's not going to work. 

315
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,600
                You're trying to
                make me jealous.

316
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,400
        Huh. Well, I'm not going
        to be asking you to move
                back in with me.

317
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
                Don't you worry.

318
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
          I know your wily ways.

319
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
     You see, you're forgetting,
         I am a graduate student

320
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,300
     of the Esther Clavin School
         of Emotional Blackmail.

321
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,100
Well, that, and a nickel will   
get you a civil service job.    

322
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,700
                Back off, Ma.   

323
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,900
Clifford, I'm not trying        
to get you jealous.             

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
I don't have to.                

325
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,300
I found a wonderful             

326
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,600
companion in Woody.             

327
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
He's like the son               
I never had.                    

328
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,400
            Well, what about me?

329
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,300
You are the son I did have.     

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, I'm telling you, Norm,    
I really let Ma have it.        

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,700
          I cut clean.          

332
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,900
    Well, I'll have to take     
    your word for it, Cliff.    

333
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,700
Yeah, it really feels good      
to get that monkey off my back. 

334
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,500
    Whatever you say.           

335
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah, she's out of there,       
    gone, good-bye, finito.     

336
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
  Cliff, what do I have to say  
to make you stop talking?       

337
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,700
        Yes, sir, today         
    I am a man, Norm.           

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
How about, "I've got a crowbar?"

339
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
        (chuckles)              

340
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,800
            Oh, hey, Rebecca,   
                        come on,

341
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,300
             you be Ma again and
          I'll be me, all right?

342
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,100
Oh, Cliff, you know, Sam does   
a lot better Ma than I do.      

343
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,600
         Oh, yeah, right, right.

344
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,900
All right, Ma, get off my back! 

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,700
SAM:                            
I'm busy, Cliff.                

346
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,100
        Oh, no, no, Sam.        

347
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
     There's too much love      
         in your voice.         

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,700
                    I think that
                 ought to do it.

349
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,900
What do you mean                
"that ought to do it?"          

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,500
  You need to cut another bar   
         out of there.          

351
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
     People have to squeeze     
         through there.         

352
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
              Rebecca, trust me.

353
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
        I've spent a lifetime   
              learning how to do

354
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,400
        the least amount of work
             for any given task.

355
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,500
        This'll fit the bill.   

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
      I-I just don't think      

357
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,300
 anybody's really gonna be able 
     to fit through there.      

358
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
                Even I could fit
                  through there.

359
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,400
        Watch this. Look.       

360
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,500
                 You just... you
                 just sort of...

361
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,000
                (grunting):     
            ...up and through...

362
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,200
                Well, that's it.

363
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,100
        That's it what?         

364
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,500
  You're not halfway through.   

365
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
    No, that's it, I'm stuck.   

366
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
            I'll be in Cheers   
            the rest of my life.

367
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,000
    Guess you have to be careful
              what you wish for.

368
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
      Let me see if I can       
        get you unstuck.        

369
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,500
        (grunting)              

370
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,700
        Oh, gosh.               

371
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,100
That's it, you are stuck.       

372
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,100
          Sam! Carla!           

373
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,700
  You'd better hurry, Rebecca,  

374
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,100
      'cause I think I see      
  that damned Chihuahua again.  

375
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,800
      Hey, there's a whole      
      pack of Chihuahuas.       

376
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,100
I hope they're Chihuahuas!      

377
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,000
          Oh, my God!           

378
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,900
You okay out there?             

379
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,200
                Yeah.           

380
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,800
    I think they're as afraid   
          of me as I am of them.

381
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
          Yeah, except          
     you don't carry rabies     

382
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,200
  and have razor-sharp teeth.   

383
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,700
Yeah, but they don't know that. 

384
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,100
      Boy, you really are       
        wedged in there.        

385
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,100
        Is that Norm?           

386
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
        Geez, you know,         
     I didn't recognize you     

387
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,700
without the bar stool attached. 

388
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,300
        (laughing)              

389
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,100
Hey, you know                   
who he looks like?              

390
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Winnie the Pooh.                

391
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
              Oh, Carla's right.
    Yeah.                       

392
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,700
    Yeah, in that story where   

393
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,200
      he eats too much honey and
    gets stuck in Rabbit's hole.

394
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,500
             Yeah, well, how did
            they get him out?   

395
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
      Oh, it's hilarious.       

396
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,200
They starved him                
for a couple of weeks,          

397
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
then yanked him out.            

398
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,600
                 Yeah. Now, when
                     he got out,

399
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,400
      did Winnie the Pooh       
  sue the damned Rabbit, huh?   

400
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,600
         Come on, man,          
     lighten up, will you?      

401
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
              Oh, sorry, Sammie.

402
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,500
        I'm just upset, okay?   

403
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
No, I mean, you're like         
dead weight here.               

404
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,100
Push, pull, do something.       

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,400
         Yeah, so I told her,   
                "Pack your bags.

406
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,700
        Go on, hit the skids.   
      I don't need you anymore."

407
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,200
What's the matter               
with him? Girl trouble?         

408
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,400
                  Well, sort of.

409
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,700
              Now I'll just have
                to raise myself.

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,700
        Well, the hard work's   
            already done though.

411
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
              Where is the child
      that's stuck in the fence?

412
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Oh, good, you're here.          

413
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,400
Uh, back this way,              
in the poolroom.                

414
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,200
"Child stuck in the fence?"     

415
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
        Well, every time I said,

416
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,200
 "Accountant stuck in a window,"
  they just laughed and hung up.

417
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,700
                        REBECCA:
                 It's back here.

418
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, Woody, that was fun.        

419
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,700
It's so nice to go              
shopping for shelf paper        

420
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,600
with somebody who doesn't       
nitpick over every design.      

421
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,600
     Ma, when are you gonna stop
    taking those potshots at me?

422
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
When it stops being fun.        

423
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,300
             Excuse me, Woody.  

424
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,600
                    I'm gonna go
                 powder my nose.

425
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Your nose looks fine,           
Mother Clavin.                  

426
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,100
That's just an expression, son. 

427
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,900
    Ah.                         

428
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,300
                        Son?    

429
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,000
              She's, uh, calling
                  you "son" now?

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,100
Well, that's just               
an expression.                  

431
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,800
You know, like                  
"powder my nose."               

432
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
            I understand, Woody.

433
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
    I want to thank you, really,
  for all you've done for my ma,

434
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,600
    you know, giving her a place
         to live and everything.

435
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,000
        There's one thing       
        my sense of pride       

436
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
won't allow me to say to her,   

437
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,200
        but I know I can talk to
        you about it man-to-man.

438
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,300
            (crying):           
         I want my mommy back.  

439
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,600
You can't have her back.        
You gave her up.                

440
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,000
            Wood, I miss her!   

441
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Well, if I give her to you,     
then I'll miss her, too.        

442
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,300
    Can't we share?             

443
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,400
          I don't want to share!

444
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
      Oh, for God's sake!       

445
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,000
  You're acting like children.  

446
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,500
      Now, listen, Woody,       

447
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
        Esther Clavin is        
    Cliff's natural mother.     

448
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,900
     Therefore, logic would     
    dictate that, uh,           

449
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,700
  well, Cliff gets first dibs.  

450
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,000
Well, Woody, are we ready       
      to line some shelves      

451
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,900
    with flags of the world?    

452
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,600
    Woody?                      

453
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Woody, if you stick             
that lower lip out any further, 

454
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
a pigeon's gonna land on it.    

455
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
You know that they like         

456
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,600
shiny, ledge-like surfaces.     

457
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
                    (crying):   
      Don't bring up bird trivia
             now, Mother Clavin.

458
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,600
              It hurts too much.

459
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,100
Why, Woody, whatever            
are you talking about?          

460
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,300
         (crying and mumbling)  

461
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,700
All right,                      
all right, all right.           

462
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,900
Is this true, Clifford?         

463
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,400
        Yeah, Ma, it is.        

464
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,700
                I want you back.

465
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,900
Well, is there room for me in   
that singles' paradise of yours?

466
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,200
        I'll, I'll make room.   

467
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, I made room               
for you, Mother Clavin.         

468
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
                I'll make room  
                in your face!   

469
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,100
        No, no, no, no.         
        Now, now, boys,         

470
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,800
let's not get into a Cain       
    and Abel situation here.    

471
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,900
      I can love you both       
     for different reasons.     

472
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,400
     Woody, I can love you      

473
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,900
    because you're generous     
      and kind and strong.      

474
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
  And Clifford, I can love you  

475
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,500
        because I'm your        
    biological mother,          

476
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,200
      and nature dictates       
        there be a bond.        

477
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
Now, boys,                      

478
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,900
        I've got plenty         
    of love for both,           

479
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,700
    and Lord knows I've got     
     plenty of shelf paper.     

480
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,000
      I'll tell you what,       
      let's get cracking.       

481
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,300
We can do both of your          
apartments before dark.         

482
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,400
     Got to do mine first.      

483
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,000
            Not if I get to     
             the car first.     

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Yeah, well, you're not going    
to do that until you beat me.   

485
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,900
                    I can.      
No, you can't!                  

486
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,600
 Boys, watch out for the hole!  

487
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
(Woody and Cliff yelling)       
          (loud crash)          

488
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
        Yes, they are my        
      children all right.       

489
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,500
    Both dumb as dishwater.     

490
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,100
Well, we can get him out,       

491
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,300
but we're gonna have to         
bring in the Jaws of Life.      

492
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,000
    He's really stuck           
        in there.               

493
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,700
Yeah, it remind me of that      
Winnie the Pooh story.          

494
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
         Say, how'd he get stuck
            in there, anyway?   

495
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,900
Well, he ate up                 
all of Rabbit's honey...        

496
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,500
    No, I mean this guy.        

497
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,300
Uh, we were, uh, building       
        a new entrance.         

498
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,000
Do you have a permit            
for that?                       

499
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,700
          Oh. He wants a permit.

500
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,500
                 This time we'll
             handle it your way.

501
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,300
            No.                 
     Yes. Yes, I'll do it.      

502
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,600
     Let me just reach into     
    my magic-permit pocket.     

503
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,000
                    No, no.     
    Yes, yes.                   

504
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,400
          And, oh, here's       
        a nice little permit    

505
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,500
        with a picture          
      of General Grant on it.   

506
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,200
What are you doing?             
            (chuckles)          

507
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,400
What, like you have             
never been bribed before?       

508
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Are you trying to give          
us this 50 bucks?               

509
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,200
What, 50 isn't enough?          

510
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,700
    How about 100?              

511
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
All right, you're               
under arrest. Come on.          

512
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,000
    Sam, would you get          
         my checkbook?          

513
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,600
      So you guys ought to      
      have me out of here       

514
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,700
  in just a few minutes, huh?   

515
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,800
          Right, guys?          

516
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,000
             Guys!
