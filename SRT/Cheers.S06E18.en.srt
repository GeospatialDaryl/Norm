 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,637
No, no, it's                    
a well-documented fact          

3
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:09,272
that the female                 
of the species                  

4
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,575
     is irresistibly drawn      
    to men in uniform.          

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:14,093
Yeah, just yesterday,           
some lonely,                    
frustrated housewife            

6
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:15,962
saw me coming                   
up the garden path,             

7
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,347
    you know, peeking           
      through the window,       

8
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:19,416
         and she tries          
     to coyly titillate me      

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,950
by pulling down the shade       

10
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,352
      so I wonder what's        
      going on behind it.       

11
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:24,587
                Let me dispel   
                the mystery.    

12
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:25,805
                 She was puking.

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,290
        Carla,                  

14
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:29,659
             don't you get bored
             just hanging around
             here all day       

15
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:31,494
              waiting to take   
              cheap shots at me?

16
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,562
  Yeah, I should get a beeper.  

17
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:36,316
                All right, look.
                That's it.      

18
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,700
                    I am sick   
                    and tired   

19
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:38,851
  of being your whipping boy.   

20
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,486
     Today the worm turns.      

21
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,088
 You are not going to insult me 
          any longer,           

22
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:44,190
    because I am not going      
    to give you the chance.     

23
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:44,924
     As of from right now,      

24
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,610
    I am shutting up,           
        zipping my lip.         

25
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:48,278
          ( <i>applause</i> )          

26
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,783
And my friends support me.

      in the world today       

29

 Takes everything you've got   

30
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,348
         Taking a break        
    from all your worries      

31
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:11,450
 Sure would help a lot         

32
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:16,655
       Wouldn't you like       
         to get away?          

33
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,609
   Sometimes you want to go    

34
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:24,481
     Where everybody           
    knows your name            

35
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:29,719
 And they're always glad       
        you came               

36
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,721
         You want to be        
      where you can see        

37
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:34,724
          Our troubles         
    are all the same           

38
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,496
 You want to be where everybody
    knows your name            

39
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,581
         You want to go        
      where people know        

40
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,768
   People are all the same     

41
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:49,339
      You want to go where     
  everybody knows your name.

                    You know    
                    something,  
                    chaps,      

44
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:10,076
            I had a particularly
            fascinating session 
            this morning.       

45
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:14,630
                No, honestly.   

46
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,470
            Someone I was seeing
            for the first time. 

47
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:22,939
      Extraordinarily beautiful,
      young woman,              

48
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,741
                who's uh, rather
                unique malaise  

49
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:28,594
        is to be aroused        
        with sexual frenzy by...

50
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,946
                  Oh, good Lord.

51
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,148
            Excuse me.          
            I don't really think

52
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:34,266
          I should be discussing
          my patients here.     

53
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,657
        Uh... how about         

54
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:44,327
                 discussing them
                 over here?     

55
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,361
Well,                           

56
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,679
 I suppose it wouldn't violate  

57
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:48,480
    any doctor-patient          
        confidentiality         

58
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,149
     if I don't use names.      

59
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:52,118
Pour the beer, Woody.           

60
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:54,420
         I thought you weren't  
         going to use any names,
         Dr. Crane.             

61
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:55,488
        Woody...                

62
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,507
    Well, it seems this woman   

63
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,410
    has her passions inflamed   
    by men who dance.           

64
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:02,828
         Wait a minute,         
         Wait a minute.         

65
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,263
                  Men who dance?

66
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:05,664
         That's weird.          

67
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,950
    What's even more bizarre,   

68
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:09,619
    is that she will catapult   
    herself compulsively        

69
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:13,690
        into the arms of any man
        in tights or tap shoes. 

70
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,324
        Fascinating fixation.   

71
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:16,508
                    Huh.        

72
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:19,345
             Ooh, geez. I've got
             to go. I'm sorry.  

73
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,263
                Where you going?

74
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:22,615
        My ballet class.        

75
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,216
            No, no,             

76
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,034
         lunch, lunch.          

77
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,452
That was a little psychological 
             humor.             

78
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,237
You know, as my old             
professor used to say,          

79
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,773
    if you can't laugh          
    at your patients,           

80
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:31,040
    what fun are they?          

81
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,127
        See you later.          

82
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,161
            Norm.               

83
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:36,462
Morning, everybody.             

84
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,097
            PATRONS:            
             Norm!

         WOODY:                 
         Can I pour you a draft,
         Mr. Peterson?          

86
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,318
                A little early, 
                isn't it, Woody?

87
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,702
          For a beer?           

88
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,721
    No, for stupid questions.   

89
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:47,857
                        Pour.   

90
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,126
Would you believe the board     
of directors is asking          

91
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:51,560
for a breakdown                 
of projected earnings           

92
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:53,596
for the next six months?        

93
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,465
                    Yes.        

94
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:58,634
                        NORM:   
                        Rebecca,

95
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:00,019
    I started painting          
    Mr. Drake's house.          

96
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,887
      I want to thank you       
    for that recommendation.    

97
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:02,889
 Oh, it was my pleasure, Norm.  

98
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,157
        How's it going?         

99
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,407
         Great, great.          

100
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:06,876
He's out of town for a few days 
            so, uh,             

101
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,378
 I thought it'd be a good time  
 to get started in his bedroom. 

102
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:11,181
            I was doing a little
            prep work over there
            this morning,       

103
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:12,882
     and I must say, that's     
      a cute photo of you       

104
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,517
          he has next           
to his night stand there.       

105
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,151
             What?              

106
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:16,653
                Just kidding.   

107
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,174
I will kill you, Norm.          

108
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,408
                You know, uh,   

109
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,993
                 I am over there
                 all by myself, 

110
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,662
             so if you want     
             to drop by and, uh,

111
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:26,996
                  check any of  
                  the house out,

112
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,598
            I can get you in.   

113
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:31,333
         No... I can't.         

114
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,719
Oh, go on.                      

115
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,420
You're dying to look            
in his drawers.                 

116
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:38,507
That's right,                   
he won't be there.              

117
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,545
The last thing on my mind       
         is Evan Drake          

118
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:43,979
      and where he sleeps.      

119
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,097
No, I don't want                
to be distracted.               

120
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,934
I've got to get these figures   
into the bed of directors...    

121
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,319
      board of directors.       

122

        Excuse me,              

125
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:00,946
I'm looking for Dr. Crane.      

126
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,415
He mentioned he'd be here.      

127
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:03,733
         Oh, I'm sorry,         
      you just missed him.      

128
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,034
Oh, darn.                       

129
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,736
I had a session                 
earlier today                   

130
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,404
and left a package              
in his office.                  

131
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,707
When I went back,               
it was locked.                  

132
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:11,991
    Gee, I don't know           
    what to tell you.           

133
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,126
  But then again, I don't know  
what to tell most people.       

134
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,713
Uh, excuse me.                  

135
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:18,014
Uh, you had a session           
with him?                       

136
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,915
Are you a patient of his?       

137
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:21,150
              That's right. Why?

138
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:22,518
Oh, just curious.               

139
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,210
                 Well, it's not 
                 that important.

140
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,678
                I just thought  
                if I caught him,

141
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,314
            I could still       
            get my package back.

142
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:35,714
I understand perfectly.         

143
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,573
            Well, I'm out       
            of luck, I guess.   

144
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:45,608
            I'll just have      
            to stop by tomorrow.

That's a beautiful name         
for a beautiful girl.

down with me,

    a dancer could do

171
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,084
                    kicked you

I know-- that's how I feel      
in my bedroom.                  

183

I just feel kind of like        
I'm trespassing.

    This is not right.

  I should not be doing this.

          I shouldn't.

  explain it if I got caught.

How are you going to get caught?

Because people always get caught
    in this situation.
