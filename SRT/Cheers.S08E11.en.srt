00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,355
i'm telling you guys,   
        davy crockett was the   
        greatest american hero.

3
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:08,924
[Men chattering]       
                 no question.

4
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:11,793
Come on, man! That guy--       
 he deserted his wife and kids,

5
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:14,729
had one of the worst        
    absentee records            
    in the history of congress.

6
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,713
Well, who's your hero?

7
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,382
Bambino, babe ruth,

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,451
sultan of swat,        
         built yankee stadium.

9
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:20,902
What?  
 Come on, stop, will you?

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,370
From what i hear,              
 the guy was a glutton,

11
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,038
a regular eating               
 and drinking machine.

12
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:26,808
Oh, who am i supposed to       
 pattern my life after, gandhi?

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,311
All right, you wanna talk      
 about american heroes?

14
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,880
I'll give you              
      <i>numero uno,</i>               
                    <i> who?</i>

15
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:34,048
The only guy who should be     
 on the list:                   
 mr. J. Edgar hoover.

16
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:36,918
What?       
 J. Edgar hoover                
 was a paranoid,

17
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:38,553
right-wing, megalomaniac

18
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,389
who used his position          
 to intimidate presidents       
 and congressmen

19
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,491
and smear anybody              
 who disagreed with him.

20
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,662
[Exclaiming]                   
 can't poke any holes           
 in that guy, can you, then?

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,432
Let's face it, everybody.      
 In america, in the 1990s,

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,967
there are no heroes anymore.

23
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:55,070

Hey, everybody, guess what?

35
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,310
I was reading          
          <i>the farmer's almanac.</i>

36
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,664
Guess what?                    
 This is an historical day.

37
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:59,400
This is the 2nd coldest day    
 in the history of boston.      
                        Yeah?

38
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:01,652
And don't you wanna know   
     when the coldest day

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,654
in the history             
     of boston was?

40
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,406
Uh, well,                  
     things are pretty boring   
     around here

41
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:08,109
but i don't think we've    
     quite sunk                 
     that low yet, woody.

42
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:09,511
Guess what, you guys?

43
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:12,030
Robin colcord                  
 bought me a new desk.

44
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:14,799
So when was the coldest day 
    in the history of boston?

45
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:17,902
(Woody)                        
 interestingly enough,

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,056
the coldest day                
 in boston's history            
 did not start out that way.

47
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:23,090
Yeah, it started out           
 relatively warm,

48
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,960
then but by noon,              
 the temperature                
 began to drop.

49
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,895
So, you got a new desk, huh?

50
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:35,553
Hey, normie, you wanna see 
     where the flannigans' dog  
     almost bit me?

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,124
Oh, congratulations, cliff, 
    you have just won           
    the boston bore-athon.

52
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,660
Mr. Clavin, how can you        
 be delivering mail

53
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:46,497
on the coldest day             
 in the boston's history        
 except for one?

54
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:48,466
A very good question,          
 young woodman.

55
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:52,070
It seems that like, uh,        
 any member of                  
 your camel family, uh,

56
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,005
we clavins have an extra--

57
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,908
oh, wait. That's how i can go  
 without water for a week.

58
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:01,313
Woo! Boy,              
         is it cold out there!

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,782
Don't even try, sam.           
 These people don't care.

60
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:07,953
Hey, it's the kind of day

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,956
you wanna curl up          
     in front of a roaring fire 
     with a good book.

62
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:14,292
Unfortunately, the one      
    i've been working on        
    is around here someplace.

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,513
Oh, here we go! Let's see, 
     where was i? Tina! Tina.

64
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,566
Tina, 2 stars.

65
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,718
2 stars?                       
 That's not very good,          
 is it, sam?

66
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:25,436
Are you kidding me?    
         It was great.

67
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,405
That's what                 
    she was wearing, 2 stars.

68
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,944
Sammy, uh, excuse me,      
     do you know                
     how to spell "courteous"?

69
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,862
Um, yeah, norm,         
        just as it sounds.

70
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,383
Then check it with frasier.

71
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,418
Yeah, i gotta write            
 this letter of recommendation

72
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,087
for doris,                     
 remember my secretary doris.

73
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,056
Oh, yeah, what, did she, uh,   
 she quit?

74
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,074
No, i have to let her go.

75
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:51,712
Business hasn't been       
     going too good since       
     i decided to stop working.

76
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,231
Anyway, she's on her way   
     over here. I got to        
     finish this puppy.

77
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,083
Oh, what have you got      
     so far there?              
                I got like,

78
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,503
"to whom it may concern,   
     doris..."

79
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,506
and then                   
     there's this middle chunk  
     that i'm still working on.

80
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:03,808
Then i close it with,  
         "i hope the red sox    
         win the pennant.

81
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,860
Norm peterson."

82
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:09,130
Which is-- that's how i end 
    all my correspondences.

83
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:12,350
No, actually, norm,            
 you have to use                
 upbeat adjectives like, um,

84
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,553
oh, hardworking,            
    loyal, professional...

85
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,037
good.              
             Good, good, good.

86
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,273
Uh, how about prompt?

87
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,391
Ooh, prompt.        
            Cliffie, all right.

88
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,094
If i might make a suggestion,  
 why don't you write it         
 on stationery

89
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:26,698
instead of a cocktail napkin?

90
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,367
Boy, you know, i--i--i bet     
 it was murder for robin

91
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,404
to get that desk        
        delivered on a cold day 
        like this.

92
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,273
Yeah, i bet there was          
 only one day                   
 in boston's history

93
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,476
when it would've               
 been harder to get             
 something delivered.

94
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,678
If you pretend             
     like you're interested     
     in my desk,

95
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,780
i'll pretend               
     like i'm interested        
     in your weather.

96
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,282
Deal, miss howe.

97
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,201
You know,                  
     interestingly enough,      
     the coldest day

98
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:49,270
in boston's history            
 did not start off that way.

99
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:52,507
Like the barometric pressure   
 in the morning--               
     i'm sorry, woody. Wait.

100
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,392
I bit off                      
 more than i can chew.

101
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:57,828
All right, guys.

102
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,931
Here, i got a good start    
    on this.

103
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,066
I open with all that   
         courtesy crap.

104
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,201
(Cliff)                 
        yeah?

105
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,653
And, uh, then i go,         
    "i'm sorry to let doris go.

106
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:08,356
"No reflection on her.      
    She's a, uh, fine worker.

107
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,491
"And i'm sure she'll be        
 an asset to any company.

108
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,294
And may the red sox...     
     yada-yada. Norm peterson."

109
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,646
(Cliff)             
            that's good.

110
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,013
(Norm)         
                 yeah. Uh-oh.

111
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,665
Oh, there she is.

112
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:22,820
My god. He's going to fire     
 the morton salt girl.

113
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,727
Doris, hi.         
             Here you go. Uh,

114
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,679
just have a seat.

115
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:36,651
Thank you, mr. Peterson.       
            Oh, you're welcome.

116
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:39,253
It's a very nice place.        
                        Well...

117
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,622
i would offer to               
 buy you a drink,               
 but i don't have any money.

118
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,791
Ah.     
 Do you know if they accept     
 the sears card?

119
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:48,329
No, no, it's ok, doris. 
        It's ok, really.

120
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:51,549
[Sighing]              
         doris, i don't know    
         quite how to put this.

121
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,019
You've really been          
    a great secretary, but, uh,

122
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:57,939
i just can't afford 
            to keep you around  
            any longer.

123
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,224
Oh, god, i'm fired.        
     I wish i was dead.

124
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,978
Doris, really, i'm very sorry. 
 You know, it really            
 hurts me to do this.

125
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,263
Oh, don't be sorry.

126
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,865
The last thing i want to do    
 is make you feel guilty.

127
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,952
I mean, working for you        
 has been                       
 the high point of my life.

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,907
Doris, all you ever did    
     was sit around my office   
     and sharpen pencils.

129
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:19,360
Please, mr. Peterson,          
 you're going to make me cry.

130
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,313
(Norm)      
                    anyway, um,

131
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,082
i've-- i've written a, uh,

132
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,284
letter of recommendation   
     for you.

133
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,819
Go ahead and take that. 
        You--you can type it up

134
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,989
and, uh, give it to me 
         for my signature.      
         That'd be...

135
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:34,225
oh, what the hell?  
            Just go ahead and   
            forge my signature.

136
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,494
Mr. Peterson, i'm overwhelmed.

137
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,780
Oh.        
 I don't know what to say.

138
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,766
What's there to say? I think   
 i've said it all there.

139
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,385
Oh, yes.                   
     Oh, yes, you have.

140
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,121
And i want you to know         
 i love you, too, mr. Peterson.

141
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,780
Prompt, courteous, 
             red sox.

142
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,298
Doris, i...

143
00:06:57,365 --> 00:07:00,050
uh, you're reading     
         something into this,   
         i-- i think. You know?

144
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:03,287
You know, it must have taken   
 a lot of guts                  
 to open up that way.

145
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:05,539
Doris, i didn't--      
         i didn't say anything.

146
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,908
I didn't mean to imply 
         anything.

147
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,626
Well, then,                
     why would you lead me on?

148
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,962
I'm not leading you on, doris. 
 You're a fine secretary.

149
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,683
Uh, a good employee, that's--  
 end of story, ok?

150
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:18,702
Oh, i see.             
                         (Norm) 
                         yeah.

151
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,571
Well,                      
     this is so embarrassing.

152
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,040
So very, very embarrassing.

153
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,293
If you'll excuse me,           
 i'll just go quietly.

154
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,795
Uh, oh, no, no, 
                doris, please.

155
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,447
Now,                       
     you don't have to do that.

156
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,865
You don't want me to go?

157
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,251
No, no, i--i--          
        i don't want you        
        to go quietly.

158
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,522
I mean, come on,   
             think about it,    
             this is a bar.

159
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,490
You can make as much noise 
     as you like.

160

         hey! Ho! Come on! Hey.

161
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,344
Hey, there!

162
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:46,848
I'll always remember           
 the way you looked             
 when you said that.

163
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:54,022
Norm, that was                 
 a very hard thing to do,

164
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:56,223
and an even harder thing       
 to watch.

165
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,051
(Rebecca)          
             oh, it's gorgeous.

166
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,386

167
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,473
isn't it gorgeous, 
             everyone?

168
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,928
You know, i could have had 
     a desk like this once.

169
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,531
A beautiful antique,   
         real prestige piece,

170
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:23,234
something to mirror        
     and dignify my status.

171
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,770
But i decided that         
     that sort of display       
     was too ostentatious,

172
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,305
so i put my money into         
 pinstriping my beamer.

173
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:31,609
Looks pretty sporty, too.

174
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,481
Afternoon, everybody.

175
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,199

Anybody seen doris         
     around here?

179
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,865
Oh, yeah, little gal

180
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,517
Bingo. Yeah.

181
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,936
Thought you got rid of her.

182
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:01,722
Hey, sammy, i'm trying to. 
     I can't shake the girl.

183
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,057
I mean, i come in cheers,  
     she's here.

184
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,810
I go upstairs              
     to plug the parking meter, 
     she's there.

185
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,012
I come back in cheers,     
     she's here.

186
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,716
Sammy, it's like somehow   
     she's figured out          
     my whole routine.

187
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,318
Oh, oh, mr. Peterson,          
 i knew i'd find you here

188
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,937
when you weren't               
 at the parking meter.

189
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,658
Could i warm up            
     your seat for you?

190
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,643
It's ok, doris,    
             it's never cold.

191
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,580
I love that about him.

00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,036

                doris,

194
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,406
Yes, mr. Peterson?

 i am not interested            
 in you, ok?

196

I'm not interested             
 in any woman                   
 except my wife,

197
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,948
and i'm not even               
 interested in her.

198
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,485
She's a very lucky woman.

199
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,637
Doris, i really hate           
 that it's come to this,

200
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:51,439
but scram, ok?

201
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,207

 You know, as a matter of fact, 
 it would.

"that's going to make you  
     very happy.

254
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,284
"Don't look for it

255
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:03,888
"because i want to be there 
    to share the surprise.

00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,023
"I will give you one hint.

"the key word is

ring."

260
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,067
It's a ring, carla.

261
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,837
There is a ring        
         hidden in that desk.

262
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,723
Isn't that romantic?

263
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:26,443
My ex-husband                  
 hid my engagement ring

264
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:28,646
in an x-rated soap on a rope.

265
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:33,634
He scrubbed me raw             
 for 2 hours                    
 before i found it.

266
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,771
Now, that's magic time.

267
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,291
God, what am i supposed to do?

268
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,178
I can't look for my ring       
 for 2 weeks?

269
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,664
All right.                  
    If that's what robin wants,

270
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,400
i will respect     
             the man's wishes.

271
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,202
The important thing            
 is to stay out                 
 of his drawers,

272
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,122
which shouldn't be too hard    
 for you.

273
00:12:58,693 --> 00:12:59,794
Want another one, norm?

274
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,312
No, thanks, sammy.      
        I think i'm going home.

275

[Sniffing]

276
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,982
i don't know,              
     not feeling too great,     
     you know?

277
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,285
I just can't shake         
     the sight of doris

278
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:11,005
staring at me               
    and undressing me           
    with her eyes.

279
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,857
Now i want to go home.

280
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:17,478
Anyway, uh,             
        see you in the morning, 
        i guess, huh?

281
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,096
Yeah, i may be a little late.

282
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,414
Uh, that's ok.          
        I had a key made.

283
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,293
[Norm screaming]

284
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,471
[norm screaming]

285
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:50,010
she's following me! 
            Make it stop!       
            Make it stop!

286
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,613
I'm sorry, mr. Peterson.       
 If you don't want me           
 to follow you,

287
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,148
i could walk                   
 in front of you.

288
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,183
Then you'd have to tell me 
     where you're going         
     all the time.

289
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,085
Doris, how long have you       
 been out there?

290
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,554
I don't know.           
        The crystal on my watch 
        cracked from the cold.

291
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:04,074
I would take it off    
         but i think it's fused 
         to my skin.

292
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,159
Doris, what am i gonna         
 do with you?

293
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:08,312
Do you want me         
         to go outside and wait 
         by the parking meter?

294
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,896
No. Just sit down, will you?

295
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:13,050
Sammy, do you have      
        any hot chocolate       
        or something like that?

296
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:16,137
Uh, frasier,       
             we have to talk.

297
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:17,538
Come on.

298
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,240
No, norm, i'm sorry.

299
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,907
What?          
 I've had it                    
 with giving out

300
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:23,744
this free                      
 psychological advice.

301
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,596
It's bad enough                
 i do it as a living.

302
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,731
I mean, i have to come         
 to the bar                     
 and do it here, too?

303
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,234
I'm not about to analyze       
 this poor, pitiful creature

304
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,053
who obviously is suffering     
 from a very low self image

305
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,156
and finds in you a validation  
 of her sense of self           
 and her own personality.

306
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,909
Damn it!                       
 I did it again!

307
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:42,813
Ok, so what you're saying is   
 that i basically appeal        
 to her desperate nature?

308
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,299
Well, clinically speaking,     
 she'd go for anything

309
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:48,301
that could lumber up           
 to her under its own power.

310
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,089
Ok, now,                   
     how do i get rid of her?

311
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,591
Uh, try building up            
 her self-confidence.           
                 Uh-huh.

312
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,160
If she feels better            
 about herself,

313
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,895
she'd be less inclined         
 to degrade herself

314
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,731
by going                       
 for the likes of you.

315
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,600
I mean no offense.             
 I mean, when i say,            
 "the likes of you,"

316
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:07,304
i don't mean you personally,   
 just any unappealing,          
 go-nowhere loser.

317
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:14,261
So, why should i take offense?

318
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,964
Good man.

319
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,733
Doris.

320
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,284
I have no idea              
    why you're attracted

321
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,654
to such an unappealing,    
     go-nowhere loser as me.

322
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,674
Now, there are 100s of--

323
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:30,427
i--i'd say there's 1,000s      
 of guys who'd be happy         
 to be involved with you.

324
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,829
1,000s?                
         Yes, dozens.

325
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,934
But the letter.

326
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,036
No, doris, i didn't write  
     the damn letter, ok?

327
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,272
I mean, i--i wrote             
 the part with the red sox,

328
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,440
but the--the other guys,   
     they helped with it.       
     They--

329
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,676
cliff, cliff wrote             
 the word "prompt,"             
 didn't you, cliffie?

330
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,144
Yeah, you bet.

331
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,931
Wow.                           
 And you don't even know me.

332
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:53,400
Although,                   
    maybe in a way you do.

333
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:59,122
Ooh, ooh,                      
 red light. Red light, cliff.

334
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,859
Oh,                         
    what's-- what's the matter? 
 Frasier, come on, tell him.

335
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:02,993
Come on!

336
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:06,497
All right,              
        but after this          
        you're on the clock.

337
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,833
Cliff, you may think that  
     you're getting involved

338
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,735
in a nice little conversation  
 with this girl,

339
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,103
but, believe me,        
        she will read volumes   
        into everything

340
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:16,173
you say and do.        
 Cliffie, it's like she's       
 a zombie love slave,

341
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,975
just willing to do anything

342
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,377
to serve her man.              
 You understand                 
 what i'm saying?

343
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:22,146
Oh, yeah.      
                 Crystal clear.

344
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,865
I got a live one.              
 I don't even have to buy her   
 a drink.

345
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,518
Hey.

346
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,521
Carla, come here.

347
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,257
There's a handle loose      
    on one of the desk drawers. 
    Do we have a screwdriver?

348
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:35,676
You can't fool me.             
 You're just trying to take     
 that desk apart

349
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,027
to look for your ring.

350
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm way above that. 
            I would not betray  
            my man's trust.

351
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,518
You know, that handle  
         is really loose.

352
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,487
Do we have a crowbar?

353
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,925
[Traffic humming]

354
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,661
you know,          
             a postal carrier   
             is pretty much

355
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:57,697
the indiana jones              
 of your, uh, civil servants.

356
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,019
Just as indy faces off  
        a pit of rattlesnakes

357
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,270
or a sewer full of rats,

358
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:09,442
i have to, daily           
     mind you, trade wits       
     with the flannigans' dog.

359
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,661
Oh, cliff,                 
     when you get out           
     of the service,

360
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,647
could we go out together?

361
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,335
Well, uh, you know, doris, 
     there's actually no rule

362
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:20,371
against mailmen dating women.

363
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:22,723
It just sort of turns out  
     that way.

364
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,111
How you doing there, norm?

365
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,596
Uh, kind of at loose ends  
     a little bit, you know?

366
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:30,714
[Inhaling]

367
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,449
i just feel strange 
            not having

368
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:36,353
that sad, pathetic creature 
    following me around         
    all the time.

369
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,055
Doris kind of grew             
 on you, huh?

370
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,040
Oh, no. I meant cliff.

371
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:43,226
Hi, guys.

372
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,179
Woody, what are you doing  
     in that stuff?

373
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,464
Man, where's your coat? 
        You must be freezin'.

374
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,182
You're telling me.

375
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,519
The deejays made me dress up   
 in all this hawaiian stuff

376
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:54,622
and take pictures              
 outside the radio station.

377
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:03,430
Then they locked me out    
     and kept all my clothes.

378
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,833
I hate                     
     those mean morning shows.

379
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,653
Hey, there.             
         Yeah.

380
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,188
We found this in the truck.

381
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,457
It must've fallen out          
 that big old desk.

382
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,559
Oh. Well, yeah,    
             thanks very much.

383
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:17,978
Ooh.

384
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,663
I wonder if...

385
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,567
[mocking rebecca]          
     the ring is in there?

386
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,204
I'll tell you, nothing         
 more pathetic than             
 a billionaire on the make.

387
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,639
You know, when i got a babe    
 in my cross hairs,

388
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:32,843
i don't waste time             
 sending her jewelry            
 and furniture.

389
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,812
The only time you'll see me    
 move a desk

390
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,430
is when i want                 
 more room on the floor         
 for her.

391
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,752
What do you got?           
             No ring in here,   
             just some paper.

392
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,153
[Clears throat]

"this certificate

00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,807
I wonder if that's the one     
 where he fought                
 the mole people?

400
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,748
So this tea cup thing  
         is the ring

401
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,783
colcord was talking about.

402
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,019
Yeah, boy,                  
    that's really romantic,     
    isn't it?

403
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:20,190
A desk that used               
 to belong to some dork         
 who writes comic books.

404
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:23,760

 a lot to learn about chicks.

[Chainsaw buzzing]

00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:50,621
maybe, some other time.

00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,360
I have to go powder my nose.

All right, cliffie,            
 i'm not gonna let you

418
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,382
take advantage                 
 of that poor girl, ok?

419
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,384
Oh, come on,                
    stop being such a big baby.

420
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,769
Y-you're just mad          
     'cause, uh, she likes me   
     and not you.

421
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,989
Carla, hurt cliff.             
     No, no! Hey! No, no, no.

422
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,608
I'm having a good time. 
        That's all, man.

00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,160
Come on, cliff,             
    she's a nice girl.          
    She's got a few problems,

424
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,263
and you're just using          
 that knowledge to get          
 an easy roll in the hay.

425
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,814
Well, duh!

426
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:38,218
Come on, cliff,             
    you don't really care       
    about her. Admit it.

427
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:40,503
Oh, come on, norm, 
             of course i care   
             about the girl.

428
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:43,039
I mean, i'm the one        
     who said she was prompt.

429
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,342
You're a mailman,              
 what the hell do you know      
 about prompt?

430
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,111
All right.             
         That's it, peterson.

Oh, i'm really shaking, cliff. 
 What are you going to do,      
 speed sort me?

433
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:57,771
Hey, are you two       
         fighting over me?

434
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:01,758
Oh, no. I've broken up  
        a wonderful friendship

435
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,995
because i was selfishly 
        thinking of nothing

436
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,380
but my own burning     
         womanly needs.

437

I hate myself.

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,869
Now this has gone on       
     long enough.

If i may intercede,            
 you are mistaken.

2 men were about to have   
     a fight over you.

Now that should show you   
     that you're worth having.

442
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,344
You don't have to settle,      
 you can pick and choose.

443
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,798
You can be selective           
 you can go out                 
 with whoever you want.

444
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,068
Who are you,        
            and why are you     
            so damned handsome?

445
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,557
You're settling again.

446
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:36,143
Oh. Oh, i guess        
         you're right.

[Mumbling]

448
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,913
of course, in a case           
 with someone like me,          
 i can see how you wouldn't

449
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,264
think it was settling--

450
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,733
oh, no, no, you're right.  
     I can do better.

451
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,620
Good luck, babe.

452
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,675

I can do better than you.

I can do better than you.

455
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:04,604
No. I could never          
     do better than you.

You--you weren't like this  
    when you worked for me.

460
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,563
Well, i was different then.

461
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:15,365
I was somebody.

462
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,302
I was                      
     mr. Peterson's secretary.

463
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,871

464
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,657
Well, wait a minute.       
     Now what if you came back  
     to work for me, huh?

465
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:25,342
What if i hired you again?

466
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,377
Mr. Peterson                   
 please don't taunt me          
 this way.

467
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:28,945
No. I'm serious.

468
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,114
I would hire you,          
     we miss you at the office.

469
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,083
I mean, business        
        has fallen off these--

470
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,935
these 7 hours           
        since you've been gone, 
        terribly.

471
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,422
Oh, mr. Peterson,           
    i gladly accept your offer.

472
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,357

474
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,061
but i--i think,             
    you should know,

475
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,596
i have a rule about romance    
 in the workplace.

476
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:48,482
Yeah, sure.             
        Anything you say. What?

477
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,517
I don't fish                   
 off the company pier.

478
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:55,438
That's ok, doris.       
        This company            
        doesn't have a pier.

479
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,342

     rather well,               
     don't you, wood?

     a, uh, celebratory beer,   
     please?

                         Hey.

483
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,520
You mean to tell me,           
 you're going to pay            
 that girl week after week

484
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:11,688
just to stop following you,    
 watching your every move,

485

    your beer drinking?

Come on, frasier,          
     this is nothing.
