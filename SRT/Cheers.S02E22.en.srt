1
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:05,048
I'LL BE SEEING YOU (PART 2 )

2
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:11,130
- That's it, foIks. Let's Iock it up.
- Hey, CarIa. Can I give you a Iift?

3
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:16,468
- I doubt it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

4
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:20,764
- A ride home? I know what that means.
- What?

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:25,561
We'II get to my pIace and you'II say,
''I couId do with a coffee.''

6
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:30,024
Out of the goodness of my heart,
I'II invite you in.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,361
We'II taIk for a whiIe.
Then it'II get Iater, quieter.

8
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:38,157
You'II ask me if my radio works.
I'II say, ''Yeah.''

9
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:43,912
You'II put on a soft music station,
we'II start dancing around the kitchen.

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,460
As we dance, you'II take a chance.
You'II give me a kiss right here.

11
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:53,797
- I'm not that kind of guy.
- Shut up and Iisten.

12
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:59,011
You give me a kiss
and a nibbIe on the ear.

13
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:01,347
- Which ear?
- Your choice.

14
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:05,225
I respond reIuctantIy
which makes you crazy.

15
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:14,878
I'm Ernie Pantusso. I'II teII you
what happened Iast week on ''Cheers''.

16
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:18,882
I'm good at expIaining things.
I was a basebaII coach.

17
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:23,762
Let me iIIustrate. You may remember me
from my pIaying days.

18
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:27,391
I hoId the record
for the most times hit by a pitch.

19
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:30,894
That's as good as a hit.
Anyway, where was I?

20
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:36,233
Last week on ''Cheers'', this feIIow
Semenko came into the bar.

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,657
He's a very famous artist. WhiIe he was
here, he saw Diane and he got an idea.

22
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:47,578
He decided to paint her.
He thought she was speciaI.

23
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:52,249
Diane Ioved the idea. She'd heard
of him and thought he was good,

24
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,043
and Diane's very smart.

25
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,632
The troubIe is, when Sam met
this artist Semenko, he hated him.

26
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,304
He toId him not to paint Diane's
picture and to get out.

27
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,100
Semenko started to go. Sam Ieft
the room. Diane pretended to go aIong,

28
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,394
but went behind Sam's back.

29
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:17,816
Wait. This is starting to Iook
Iike a diagram for our oId doubIe steaI.

30
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:23,947
When the pitcher goes into his wind-up,
the runners break for second and third.

31
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:27,242
If they are occupied,
second breaks for third.

32
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:30,913
Third goes home.
The batter hits to the opposite fieId

33
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,710
so the fieIder's pIay is to home pIate.
Sorry. This isn't the doubIe steaI.

34
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:40,088
These are directions
to my daughter's house.

35
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,507
I'm wrong again. She moved.

36
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,718
Or did she?

37
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:48,263
Anyway,
Diane was going behind Sam's back.

38
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,433
Wait. I reaIIy want you to paint me.

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,020
What about that maIignant growth
you caII a boyfriend?

40
00:03:55,187 --> 00:04:00,108
Once he sees the finished work, he'II
forgive me. He'II forgive everything.

41
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:03,820
He'II hate it.
And he'II hate you for doing it.

42
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,156
So you won't do it?

43
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:08,367
I'II do it for free.

44
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:13,747
I'm worried. I can't remember
where my daughter Iives.

45
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:16,291
Oh, weII, you're up-to-date.

46
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,712
It's somewhere in New EngIand.
Something Lane or Drive.

47
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:35,185
Listen up, everybody, wiII you?

48
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,396
The picnic is off.

49
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:43,527
- Why is that, Coach?
- Lack of interest. I'm caIIing it quits.

50
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:45,862
Sorry to spoiI your picnic.

51
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,073
My picnic?

52
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,743
You think I was doing this aII for me?

53
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,874
You think I Iike sitting out in the dirt
and fighting the ants for a chicken Ieg?

54
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,085
I can do that at home.

55
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:06,383
But Iisten. Forget everything. Forget the
picnic, forget my sweat and my work.

56
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,718
Forget me.

57
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,348
What the heck.
I'm going to Coach's picnic.

58
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:16,685
Stick my name up there too,
wiII you, Taffy?

59
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:24,985
Pathetic-oId-man bit, CarIa,
works Iike a charm.

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,323
Afternoon, everybody.

61
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:36,663
- What's up, Normie?
- The temperature under my coIIar.

62
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,209
- What's the matter?
- The Hungry Heifer Restaurant again.

63
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:45,213
- It's the pits.
- You went back? I thought you hated it.

64
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,886
- I got Iured back, Surf and Turf SpeciaI.
- What's that? Lobster and steak?

65
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,514
Tuna fish sandwich with beef gravy.

66
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:00,562
Diane is Iate again today.

67
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,857
You know, she's been Iate
every day this week.

68
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:07,152
Ever since Sammy threw Semenko out.

69
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,906
I couId have toId Sammy
a Iot about that guy.

70
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,116
He's a reaI headcase.

71
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:19,372
And Iike aII artists worthy of the name,
the man is a homosexuaI.

72
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,877
You think everyone a bit different is gay.

73
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:29,549
- I've given you the benefit of the doubt.
- You think aII artists are gay?

74
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:35,180
AbsoIuteIy. If you don't beIieve me,
I'II bring down this book from home.

75
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:40,060
''Nude MaIe Statuary''. You teII me
after Iooking at those pictures

76
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:45,357
that the guys who chiseIIed those Iads
aren't Iight on the Ioafers.

77
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,585
It's wonderfuI.

78
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:08,046
ReaIIy. It is.

79
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,720
Damn it! I've run out of taIent.

80
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm worthIess.

81
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,811
I'm a dog.

82
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:26,439
Stick a knife
between my shouIder bIades.

83
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:29,484
PIease. You do this every day.

84
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:36,533
- Today it's different. I've reaIIy Iost it.
- Is there anything I can do?

85
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,704
- WeII, there is one thing.
- Anything. What?

86
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,123
Let's go to bed.

87
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:48,044
You want to...make Iove?

88
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:52,924
No, I aIways take a nap
with a bIonde in the afternoon.

89
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:57,512
I don't know what to say.
We have a professionaI reIationship.

90
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,723
Afterwards, you can pay me.

91
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,853
I make Iove to everything I paint.

92
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:09,983
You're most famous painting
is of the Harvard-YaIe footbaII game.

93
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,194
Yes, I spent three months in jaiI.

94
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,615
CoIIege types don't understand me.

95
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:21,411
I do, however,
stiII get a few Christmas cards.

96
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,377
You're a very taIented man.

97
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:32,589
If we had met at a different time...

98
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:37,010
Wait a minute.
The probIem is not my taIent, it's you.

99
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:43,224
You've Iost your agony. You've Iost that
sense of anguish that drew me to you.

100
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,644
I'm sorry.
What shouId I do to get unhappy?

101
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:50,273
Why don't you go see
what BuIIwinkIe's doing?

102
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,736
- Don't caII him that.
- Who?

103
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:57,655
I know to whom you are referring.

104
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:01,117
You're aIways making remarks
about him.

105
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:08,249
- I don't Iike that. You don't know him.
- I know him better than you do.

106
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,460
What a prize!

107
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,713
Stop.

108
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:17,842
I admit,
Sam and I are very different peopIe.

109
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:24,515
Sometimes that's good.
Sometimes it's not so good.

110
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,686
Sometimes he makes me cry.

111
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,360
Sometimes he hurts me
and seems to Iike it.

112
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:43,868
That's it. It's back. The torment is back.

113
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,330
And with it, my briIIiance!

114
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,836
- I'II put some coffee on.
- Never mind. I'm done.

115
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,632
What?

116
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,936
I Iove it.

117
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,939
So wiII Sam. He wiII.

118
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,736
I got it. My probIems are soIved.

119
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:21,781
An expIoding pizza for Diane?

120
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:25,743
No. That's good, but no.

121
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,123
Remember how she was disappointed
that I wouIdn't Iet Smirnoff paint her?

122
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:34,377
- Insists he's a great artist.
- We know what that means.

123
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,213
I've got something to cheer her up.

124
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,177
Someone did a painting from photos that
weren't good enough for Laughing Boy.

125
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:47,473
- Where did you get it?
- Saw it in an ad in the TV guide.

126
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,186
The one with the cover story
about the ten cutest sitcom kids.

127
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,147
Interesting reading.

128
00:10:54,313 --> 00:11:00,737
This guy takes an ordinary photograph
and he turns it into a work of art.

129
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:03,197
You ready for this?

130
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,460
Good one, Sammy!

131
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:21,132
Even I think that's tacky.

132
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,135
ReaI jerky.

133
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,345
I knew that.

134
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:29,390
Don't you worry about me. I knew that.

135
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:34,228
- A reaI work of art there.
- This is great, actuaIIy.

136
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,231
I was afraid she might think
I was serious,

137
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:42,195
but I see now that the humour of this
isn't wasted on anybody.

138
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:50,244
It's the most powerfuI statements
of meIanchoIy I've seen

139
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:56,250
and Sam wiII appreciate that it's
atrabiIious yet not a bit Iugubrious.

140
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,379
If you think
Sam's gonna Iove this painting,

141
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:04,008
you're crazier than I'm accused of being.

142
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,888
Go ahead and show it to him.

143
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:12,266
Goodbye.

144
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:15,645
You're not coming to the bar to show it?

145
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:19,440
No. But say hi to aII the gang for me.

146
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:25,488
Besides, I think you shouId be aIone
with Mortimer tomorrow.

147
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:29,867
Don't caII him that,
and why shouId I be aIone with him?

148
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:34,038
Because it's the Iast time
you'II ever see him.

149
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,471
Hi, CarIa. Sorry I'm Iate.

150
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:58,020
- What's that?
- The Iarge package is a portrait of me.

151
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:01,107
It's that weirdo artist Sam threw out.

152
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:04,777
- I know what you been doing.
- You figured it out.

153
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:07,363
Of course. It's aII so obvious.

154
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:14,620
I've been Iate a Iot this week. You've
had to do a Iot of extra work. Here.

155
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:17,581
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

156
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:23,379
My way of saying you did something
nice for me. And I thank you.

157
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,348
Hey, that's beautifuI.

158
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:39,145
- You can wear it with your purpIe outfit.
- I probabIy can!

159
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:46,235
It's poIite to express gratitude
when one is given a gift.

160
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,446
Yeah, right.

161
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,631
Damn, I Iove that thing too.

162
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,676
- CarIa, keep it.
- Good.

163
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,514
- Where's Sam?
- In the back.

164
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:19,310
Why don't you take the day off?
I'II cover.

165
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,771
I owe it to you. Join the picnic.

166
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,193
OK. I know what you're doing.
I see what you're up to.

167
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:33,616
You're doing aII this just to get me to say
that thing that peopIe say

168
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:36,577
when other peopIe do them favours.

169
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:40,998
- You don't have to say it. Go.
- I don't? Thank you.

170
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,337
I have to punish my tongue.

171
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:58,849
- Hey, babe. What's up?
- This.

172
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:03,187
- What's that?
- It's a painting of me.

173
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,984
It was that Semenko guy.
You went behind my back.

174
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:14,198
I toId you I didn't want you to do this.
You knew how I feIt and did it.

175
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:17,910
Let's not taIk untiI after you Iook.

176
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:21,080
I don't want to Iook.
I want an expIanation.

177
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:27,086
- This is my expIanation.
- Fine. I'II Iook at the damn thing.

178
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,714
- Don't Iook in that frame of mind.
- Tough.

179
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:36,554
You're upset. I don't want you to Iook
untiI your mind is open.

180
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,099
It's fiIIed with animosity
to PhiIIip and me.

181
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:43,519
It is not. My mind is compIeteIy empty.

182
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:47,481
I'm not going to have you Iook
untiI you caIm down.

183
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:53,320
You're crazy. First you teII me you want
me to Iook at it, now you won't Iet me.

184
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:58,409
You can Iook. I just have to see
some evidence of caImness.

185
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:00,619
I'm caIm, Diane.

186
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:03,372
- No, you're not.
- I am caIm.

187
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,709
No, you're not.

188
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,796
I'm caIm. If I were any more caIm,
I wouId be dead.

189
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:15,551
Your jaw muscIes are quivering.

190
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:19,930
I get that way when I'm about
to Iook at art. Now, come on.

191
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:26,270
- We'II do this Iater.
- Fine.

192
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:32,985
I don't want anything to distract you
from this painting.

193
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:37,197
When you see it,
you'II understand and forgive.

194
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:43,203
- What happens if I hate it?
- You know you're going to Iove it.

195
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,292
Because in the Iast six months,
you've made so much progress.

196
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,712
You sound Iike
you're taIking about a chimp.

197
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,007
I push the buttons
and out pops a banana?

198
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:57,968
That's a Iudicrous comparison.

199
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:02,681
There isn't a chimp aIive
who couId keep up with you.

200
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:07,644
I hate when you do this.
You teII poor Sam what he shouId Iike.

201
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:14,109
What he shouIdn't Iike. How he shouId
waIk. What fork to use with soup.

202
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:19,448
I know. You don't use a fork with soup.
It was a mistake.

203
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,744
Do not say,
''You don't use a fork with soup.''

204
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,914
Do not say,
''You don't use a fork with soup.''

205
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:34,922
- My God. I've made you a babbIing idiot.
- Who are you caIIing a babbIing idiot?

206
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,300
Don't get upset. I'm criticising myseIf.

207
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:43,263
You caII me a babbIing idiot
and you're criticising yourseIf?

208
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,684
Let me criticise me for a whiIe.
You're sickening.

209
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,982
I shouId have known.

210
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:59,404
I tried to convince myseIf that you...
That I'm... That we're...

211
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:09,581
This reIationship has aIways been
a contest of wiIIs. I give up.

212
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:14,211
AII my rage has gone.
Maybe everything has gone.

213
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:20,884
I see what you're doing. You don't
wanna fight because I'm winning.

214
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:26,890
I hammered you good. I've won a Iot.
I just never mentioned it before.

215
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:32,563
- Yeah, come on.
- I'm Ieaving. I find this very tiresome.

216
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:36,984
You're not Ieaving yet.
Not tiII we've had a brouhaha.

217
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,611
Brew on your own haha.

218
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:43,907
I teII you, I'm through. I'm empty.

219
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:48,078
The onIy thing
empty about you is your head.

220
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:53,750
You Ieave and I'II be
crawIing with chicks by sundown.

221
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,961
Wait. I'm not through yet.

222
00:18:56,128 --> 00:19:00,382
You want that?
Watch this. I'm gonna do it too.

223
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:02,593
I'm gonna do this.

224
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:08,181
AII right. Wait!
I'm saving my best for Iast!

225
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,393
Ready for my best?
This is my best shot.

226
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:19,651
My God.

227
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,862
ChiIdish.

228
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:28,785
It's degrading to me, to you.
To the human race.

229
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:34,166
This doesn't bother me at aII.

230
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,251
Stop it!

231
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:42,299
- Gotcha. I win again.
- I want you to know something.

232
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:48,555
Since knowing you, I've said to myseIf,
''One day, we'II get down to the reaI you.''

233
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:50,766
WeII, we did it.

234
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:57,564
Do you know what the difference is
between you and a fat, braying ass?

235
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,650
The fat, braying ass wouId.

236
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,034
Speaking of fat, braying asses,
you're about to get dumped on yours.

237
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:12,287
How dare you sIap me?

238
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:18,877
- Don't you ever hit me again.
- Like heII.

239
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:29,596
You aIways think you've gotta get
the Iast one in. AII right. Come on.

240
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:34,518
- PIease, Iet go.
- You first.

241
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:38,230
AII right. On the count of three.

242
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:43,568
One, two, three. Now.

243
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:50,200
- You're not Ietting go.
- You're squeezing harder.

244
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,619
Because you're not Ietting go.

245
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:57,916
I'm not Ietting go
cos you're squeezing harder. Come on.

246
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:05,340
This is it. We have sunk as Iow
as human beings can sink.

247
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,928
There's no degradation Ieft.

248
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:20,397
- Are you OK?
- Do I Iook OK?

249
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:25,151
ActuaIIy, you Iook a IittIe Iike RudoIph.

250
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:32,993
Come to me, my sweet IittIe reindeer.
Your big oId stag's in town.

251
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,412
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

252
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:38,206
- You hit me!
- WeII, not hard.

253
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,334
What does that mean, not hard?

254
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,671
It means not as hard as I wanted to.

255
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:48,258
- I'm Ieaving.
- Wait. You're not Ieaving yet.

256
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:51,553
- Not untiI I say one more thing.
- What?

257
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,306
Get the heII outta here.

258
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:05,358
You are about to cross a dangerous Iine.

259
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,861
You heard me. I want you out.

260
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:12,991
If this is coming out of the heat
of the moment, it is a bad mistake.

261
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:17,579
- One you wiII never be abIe to correct.
- Out.

262
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:22,167
Because if I go,
I am never, ever coming back.

263
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,420
Can I get that in writing?

264
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:28,923
Damn, I onIy got penciIs.
I'd Iike this in ink.

265
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,636
Don't joke, Sam. I mean it.

266
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:37,766
And I want you to understand.
If you don't stop me now,

267
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:41,353
this is the Iast time you'II ever see me.

268
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,996
Fine.

269
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:04,667
Hey, Diane.

270
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:10,840
This is it.

271
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:20,183
This is it.

272
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,354
Goodbye.

273
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,564
Goodbye.

274
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:02,452
