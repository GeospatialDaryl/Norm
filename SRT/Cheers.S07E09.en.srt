Perhaps in the house
             Woody grew up in,

the thermostat was
                at the bottom

Yes, Miss Howe.

for the executives' brats;      
well, I'll show them.

151
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,700
I am going to throw the best  
    damn party of the year.

152
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,200
I am going to have              
the best food, the best games...

153
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,100
Does anybody know where I can  
hire a professional clown?

154
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,200
Would you settle for a couple  
  of amateurs with red noses?

155
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,700
Say, you know who   
            you should hire?

156
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,800
Woody. He's an actor.

157
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
At least a
        perennial understudy.

158
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,200
That's not a bad idea.

159
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,500
I wonder if Woody's interested.

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,100
Woody?

161
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,800
I have to hire a clown      
    for a children's party.

162
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you think                    
you could handle the part?

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
"Handle the part"?

164
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,800
I've always wanted
            to play a clown.

165
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,900
You hear that,
                      everybody?

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
I get to be a clown.

167
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm a clown,          
I'm a clown, I'm a clown!

168
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,700
Sam?

169
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,200
Judy?

170
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,700
( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
            Oh, wow!

171
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
God, what a relief!

172
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,400
What are you talking about?

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
Well, it's been 15 years since
          we've seen each other,

174
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,400
and you look just   
            as good as I do.

175
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, hey, how you been?

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Oh, I've been great,            
I've been great.

177
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Well, come over
                 here, sit down.

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Carla, let's have           
 some, uh, white wine, please.

179
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,200
Guess what?
             What?

180
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,300
My daughter Laurie
        came along to say hi.

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I'd love                        
to see her again.

182
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,100
Weren't the three of            
us, didn't we have              
fun together, huh?

183
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,700
You were always a 
             great uncle, Sammy.

184
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,500
A lot of men
                    get jealous.

185
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,900
They don't want
                    to share.

186
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,200
Hey, I hope I never get

187
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
so possessive that
              I'm not willing...

188
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,700
Hi, Mom.

189
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
...to share.

190
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,500
Sam, you remember Laurie.

191
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Hi.

192
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
( <i>laughing ):</i>          
               Wow.

193
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,700
You used to be so...

194
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,500
And now she's so...

195
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,400
So, uh... hey, how are you?

196
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm fine, Mr. Malone.

197
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
"Mr. Malone"?

198
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,600
Hey, come on, I'm the same guy

199
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
that used to push you      
         in the swings

200
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,900
and give you            
        piggy-back rides

201
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,200
and play with you           
        in the bathtub.

202
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,400
No, that was me.

203
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
Oh, right, right, right.

204
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,100
Well, look at the two of you.

205
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,400
Look at the three of us.

206
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's look at the two of you  
             again.

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,300
Look, I know you two

208
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,600
have a lot of catching up to do,
     but it was really good

209
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
to see you                      
again, Sam.

210
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,700
Oh, wow, I just flashed     
        on the way

211
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,400
you used to make me hold        
your hand crossing the street.

212
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
Anyway, I'll see you.

213
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Wait, wait, where you going?

214
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,800
What's the rush?

215
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,000
Why is my voice so high?

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I got an idea.

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,200
Uh, why don't, uh,

218
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,800
why don't the three of us       
          uh, do, uh,

219
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
one of those things we used   
    to do in the old days--

220
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
You know, get an
                  ice cream cone
         together, or something.

221
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,500
I would love that.

222
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Do you know                     
something, Sam?

223
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,900
What?               
I am really glad

224
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,700
that I picked up the phone      
and called you.

225
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,700
Oh, me, too.

226
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,500
Come on, Uncle Sammy.

227
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,400
There's a lot of traffic        
out there.

228
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
( <i>high-pitched laugh</i> )

229
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,500
Looks like Sammy's              
heading for trouble.

230
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,300
Yeah, looks like
             kind of a fun trip,
             though, doesn't it?

231
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,200
Carla, did you have       
the soft drinks delivered

232
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,100
to Mrs. Ridgeway's house
        for the party tomorrow?

233
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,500
Yeah, yeah-- four cases.

234
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,400
The kids will be burping
        all through Woody's act.

235
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Don't worry, with this outfit   
and these props,

236
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,100
I'm going to have those kids    
rolling on the floor.

237
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Yeah, rolling around            
and burping--

238
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,800
now <i>there's</i> an attractive image 
for you.

239
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
You know, Woody, I envy you,  
          I really do.

240
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Creating laughter           
     can be a healing art.

241
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,400
Sometimes a clown can do better 
      than a psychiatrist.

242
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,600
Yeah, and you can fit more      
of them into a little car.

243
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,200
Got my funny horn,              
my squirting flower,

244
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
my joke book--
                can't miss.

245
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,900
CARLA:                          
Oh, yeah?

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Let's see an example            
of a joke that can't miss.

247
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
"Did you hear about             
                        Yeah.

248
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
"the human cannonball?

249
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
It's hard to find a man         
of his caliber."

250
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
I don't, uh, hear any hilarity 
    ensuing there, Wood-man.

251
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, you have to try them
        both at the same time--

252
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
the props <i>and</i> the jokes.

253
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,800
Try it again.

254
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,500
Boy, this is going              
to be flop city.

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
"Did you hear                   
about the human cannonball?

It's hard to find

See? Can't miss.

00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,000
Let me try this.

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
This looks like fun.

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Uh, all right. "You hear    
    about the sword swallower

Go ahead, Norm,

268
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,800
do another one.

269
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,500
All right.

270
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,300
Uh, "Did you hear about

Here we go.

276
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,100
Thanks, Uncle Sammy,      
        that was great,

277
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,900
but I've got to get             
to aerobics class.

278
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll call you tonight,          
Mom.

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,100
Bye, honey.

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,100
God, kids are fun!              
                 Mmm.

281
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,700
I especially loved taking her  
    to that department store

282
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
and watching her little face  
        light up.

283
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Obviously.

284
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, come on,

285
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,300
what's the matter   
                    with you?

286
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm getting a little tired

287
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,700
of having you invite Laurie     
along with us everywhere we go.

288
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,300
Oh, now, come on.

289
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,700
Mommy needs a little            
quality time for herself.

290
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Well, sweetheart, all 
          you had to do was ask.

291
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,400
Listen, what do you say         
I pick you up around 8:00--

292
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,600
just the two of us,

293
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
all evening?

294
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,300
Adults only.

295
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,300
Mmm.              
                    Mmm.

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
Why? What?

301
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
What's the matter?

302
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I guess I'm remembering
                what happened

303
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,300
the last time you tried

304
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
to pitch both ends 
             of a double header.

305
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,800
Oh, boy.

306
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,000
Is it that obvious?

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,300
I think it was
            the drooling that   
                  gave you away.

308
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
Yeah, well, see, the thing is

309
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,000
that I'm really attracted       
to Laurie,

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,700
and I want to ask her out,

311
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
but I don't want to stop dating 
the mother at the same time.

312
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,000
I mean, it's like               
a real problem, you know?

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Gee,

314
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,100
must be a burden
             being so sensitive.

315
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah.

316
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,700
Uh, Sammy,      
                door number two.

317
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,500
Hey, Laurie, what'd you
         do, forget something?

318
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Well, my class was canceled,    
so I was gonna find Mom

319
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,100
and see if she wanted           
to grab some lunch.

320
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
But I guess she                 
already left, huh?

321
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,700
Yeah, just a few minutes ago.

322
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,800
Oh, well, it's no biggie.

323
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Well, wait a minute,
            wait a minute.

324
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
Listen, uh, if you      
        have a couple minutes

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
on your hand here...

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm about due for a break,
      aren't I, Rebecca?

327
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,500
Hell yes, you've been           
back at work

328
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,300
for almost five minutes.

329
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Wouldn't it be a hoot      
     if your uncle took you

330
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,600
back to the same zoo,      
      but 15 years later?

331
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,700
How about it, guys?

332
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,200
Would that be a "hoot"          
or what?

333
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,900
Uncle Sammy,                    
you're too much.

334
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll go bring                   
the car around.

335
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,100
Great, I'll meet you      
        up there, okay?

336
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,800
Just a minute.

337
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,100
Zoos are kind of sad,           
you know?

338
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,200
Huh?

339
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,400
I mean, all those               
sedentary animals...

340
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
can't move,                     
can't run free,

341
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
they just sit there             
and drink

342
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,000
and shovel food                 
in their faces.

343
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
Sorry, man, that   
             is no kind of life.

344
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,800
FRASIER:                        
Sam?

345
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You're trying to date           
your girlfriend's daughter.

346
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,200
Now, isn't there                
a little voice

347
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,300
in the back                     
of your mind

348
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,700
trying to tell you              
something?

349
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Little voice?

350
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
Your conscience?

351
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,000
My conscience?

352
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,000
You mean like  
                 Jiminy Cricket?

353
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Well, okay.

354
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,400
Well, yeah,         
            as a matter of fact,

355
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,300
I do hear         
              this little voice.

356
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,600
But it's not coming from  
      the direction of my brain.

357
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
CARLA:
                          Sammy,

358
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,300
you better be careful.

359
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,000
See, even Carla agrees with me.

360
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
No, I'm just worried

361
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,400
that he's going to blow
         it with both chicks.

362
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,200
Mothers and daughters   
        talk to each other.

363
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, not in my family,
         but usually.

364
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,500
Sweetheart, I've handled        
trickier situations

365
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,600
than this before.

366
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,000
You remember    
                the time I dated

367
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,700
those lovely    
                Henshaw triplets

368
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,200
all at the same time?

369
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,900
Sammy, first of all,

370
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
that was back when          
 you were drinking like a fish.

371
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
And second of all,

372
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
that was one chick.

373
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,900
Frasier, you okay, bud?

374
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm a little            
        concerned here, Norm.

375
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,900
My fingers are tingling.

376
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,900
My hand's numb,     
            my feet are cold.

377
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Either I'm having   
            a heart attack

378
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,600
or this new     
                French underwear
                Lilith gave me

379
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
is too tight.

380
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,700
Ah... cancel   
                 the paramedics.

381
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,900
All right, all right.

382
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
All right!              
     I'm going on tonight!

383
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm going on!   
What do you mean,               
in your theater group?

384
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah, yeah.           
  The lead has a fever of 106.

385
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,800
The rest of the cast      
 tried to drag him out of bed,

386
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
but he kept falling down.

387
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,700
I get to go on!

388
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,500
Woody, are you                  
ready to go?

389
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,500
We're going to be late          
for the kiddie party.

390
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, Ms. Howe, I hate to let you 
down, but I can't be your clown.

391
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm playing Marc Antony.

392
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,300
"Friends, Romans, countrymen."

393
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
What are you                    
talking about?

394
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,900
Countrymen-- people who live  
    outside the city.

395
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You know, shepherds,
            farmers, ranchers.

396
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Woody, you can't                
desert me like this.

397
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't have time               
to get anyone else.

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This is the chance
          he's been waiting for.
Butt out!

399
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,900
You are the one                 
who insisted I hire him

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,900
in the first place.

401
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Well, I was merely
              suggesting...

402
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,700
Where am I going to get         
another clown now?!

403
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,200
I am ruined                     
and it's your fault.

404
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
You're the one                  
who got me in this mess.

405
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,000
You owe me a clown.

406
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
Well, where do you think
        I can find one now?

407
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,700
Gee, Frasier,      
             I mean, weren't you
             the one who said

408
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,800
how much you    
                envied Woody?

409
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Well, yes,              
    I did say that...           
                And that clowns

410
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,300
do more good than   
            psychiatrists?

411
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,100
Well, surely          
    you're not suggesting...

412
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,400
Yeah, you'll be great,     
        Dr. Crane.

413
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,300
Stuff's all right here     
          in this box.

414
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,800
You can't miss.

415
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,100
Me?

416
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,100
You want me to don  
            the jester's motley?

417
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,500
It's got to be you, Dr. Crane.

418
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,100
It takes a big man          
      to fill these shoes.

419
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Well, why not?

420
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,500
I mean, they're just children  
        after all.

421
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
And I always have had      
    a special rapport

422
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
with the wee people.

423
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Where's the harm?

424
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,500
All right,                      
let's go, Frasier.

425
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
We're late already.

426
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,300
Here's your outfit!

427
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh, gee, Woody, you know,

428
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,600
I haven't had time              
to rehearse.

429
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,300
I don't know anything           
about being a clown.

430
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
You got any last minute advice 
            for me?

431
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,500
Just be yourself.

432
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,900
Ah, words of wisdom.

433
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,200
Well, I'm out 
                  of here, okay?

434
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,900
You think Bozo the Shrink       
    can really cut it?

435
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Are you kidding?

436
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,100
That stuff is foolproof.

437
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,400
The squirting flower, the horn, 
the trick handkerchief...

438
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,200
What trick handkerchief?

439
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,500
You never showed us that.

440
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,100
That's the best one of all.

441
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,000
You pull the handkerchief       
    out of your pocket

442
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,400
and your pants fall down.

443
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,800
Underneath I'm wearing     
        these ridiculous

444
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,200
big red polka dot shorts.

445
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,300
It's a riot!

446
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,800
You mean Frasier's supposed   
  to be wearing those shorts?

447
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,200
Oh, no.

448
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
I forgot to give my underwear  
         to Dr. Crane.

449
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I should call.

450
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Well, no, no.          
I've got to get to the theater.

451
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,000
Listen, Carla,         
somebody should warn him.

452
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Would you call him?

453
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,100
Of course.

454
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,300
( <i>laughing</i> )

455
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Okay, kids,         
            you say hi to Binky!

456
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,400
KIDS:                           
Hi, Binky!

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,300
Binky, do your act.

458
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,300
I don't have an act,      
      I'm a psychiatrist.

459
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,200
Show them your funny feet.

460
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,400
I can't, I've got  
             these big shoes on.

461
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,900
Oh, I see     
                  what you mean.

462
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Say, kids, what do you      
    think of these feet, huh?

463
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,800
I got such big feet       
 because my mother was a goose.

464
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
Want to hear me honk?      
         ( <i>horn honks</i> )

465
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,600
The real clown was killed.

466
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,700
Rebecca, what am I gonna do?

467
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,500
I don't know what               
you're going to do,

468
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,000
but you better think            
of something quick

469
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because you're making...

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
Do the flower deal.

471
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
Oh, you mean this.

472
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,000
( <i>laughing</i> )

473
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,300
Hey, they like it!

474
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,700
You want to see     
            that again, kids?

475
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,100
Yeah!

476
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Hey, I'm a clown,   
            I'm a clown!

477
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,700
Hey, guys...

478
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Wait till you hear this.

479
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm sitting at a table     
    in this restaurant

480
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,600
with Judy and Laurie.

481
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,200
The mother reaches over         
and grabs my knee and says,

482
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,500
"Sam, I want you."

483
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,800
Get out.

484
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Then I feel the daughter        
reaching over

485
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
and grabbing my other knee.

486
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,300
She says, "I want you,          
too, Sammy."

487
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, yeah, yeah?

488
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,800
Then I woke up.

489
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
You know what this dream means, 
        don't you?

490
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,200
Mm-hmm, it means  
              you even dream    
              better than we do.

491
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
No, no, it means        
     that Frasier's right.

492
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,500
That my conscience          
    is getting to me.

493
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
You know,      
                 I must feel bad

494
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
that I'm going out          
        with this woman

495
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,800
while I'm trying to score with 
 her daughter at the same time.

496
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,000
Sammy, you're scaring me.

497
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,800
How do you think I feel?

498
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,100
I mean, this hasn't       
  ever happened to me before.

499
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,300
I mean, you don't think that...

500
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,000
that I'm getting scruples?

501
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,300
Now you just stop it      
    right there, buddy boy.

502
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,500
You're talking crazy.

503
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,300
Damn it, I mean,

504
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,500
I really hate this.

505
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,900
I keep hearing this little voice

506
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,700
and this time          
it's coming from my brain

507
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,200
and it just, it won't shut up.

508
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
And I got this feeling

509
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,800
that it's going                 
to keep nagging me

510
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,400
until I just                    
do the right thing

511
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,600
and break it off                
with the daughter.

512
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,100
Whoa, wait, wait,       
        Sammy, Sammy, listen.

513
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,800
I could probably weather    
      this scruples stuff,

514
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,500
but the guys...

515
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,400
I mean, they look 
              up to you so much.

516
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Sammy.        
                  Sammy, please.

517
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,700
Reconsider, okay?

518
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,100
A mother and    
                her daughter.

519
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,300
This was going 
                 to be something

520
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,900
I could tell        
            my grandchildren.

521
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, Sam, Sam.

522
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,100
Listen, guys.

523
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,300
I just have to do               
the right thing here.

524
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Hi.         
Hi.

525
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,900
What ya doing?

526
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,900
I want to talk to you.

527
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,800
I hope I'm doing the right      
thing coming to you.

528
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,700
My mom doesn't know             
I'm here.

529
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't know how                
to ask you this.

530
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,100
I've never                      
done it before.

531
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Ooh...

532
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,900
Go on.

533
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,100
Sam, when I                     
was a little girl

534
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
I used to think you were        
the most wonderful man

535
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
in the whole world.

536
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
I still do.

537
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,100
But I'm not a little            
girl anymore.

538
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,800
ALL:              
            Ooh...!

539
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
Would you, uh,
                  wait a minute?

540
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,100
I'll be right back.

541
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,300
Remember those scruples?    
                        Yeah?

542
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
To the showers.

543
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,900
Say, Laurie,

544
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,800
I want to tell you              
how happy I am

545
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,100
that you feel you can           
come and talk to me.

546
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
Because I feel that             
you and I have this...

547
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,700
Oh, look at that.               
A new ring?

548
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,900
That's what I came
              to ask you.

549
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What?                       
             I'm getting married

550
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
and I want you  
                to give me away.

551
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,100
Why you little,                 
sl... sly one.

552
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Who's the lucky guy?

553
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Oh, it's a guy  
                I met at school.

554
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,100
We've been going together   
    a couple years.

555
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,300
You know,

556
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,700
he's a lot like         
    a young you, Sam.

557
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,900
Thank you.

558
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,700
I can't wait to give you away.

559
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,400
Thank you, Uncle Sammy.

560
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I love you.

561
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, whatever.
                 Run along.

562
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm so sorry.

563
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,300
Don't feel bad, Sammy.

564
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
I let you guys down.

565
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,600
CARLA:        
                  Listen, Sammy.

566
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,300
Sure, things didn't
             go your way

567
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,700
and, sure, we're      
          a little disappointed,

568
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,100
but we'll get over it.

569
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
What's important here

570
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
is that you tried     
          to do the wrong thing.

571
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,800
Hey, that's right,              
I did, didn't I?                
                        Sammy,

572
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,200
( <i>chanting</i> ):          
         Sammy, Sammy!

573
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,100
( <i>applause</i> )

574
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Thank you. Okay, now I think  
    there's some more

575
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,500
cake and ice cream in there   
            for you.

576
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
Yay!

577
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,900
Oh, Binky, you were wonderful.

578
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,100
I must admit I was              
a bit worried at first,

579
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
it took us quite a while        
to warm up to you.

580
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,500
Yes, well, thank you,   
        kind lady.

581
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,500
See, actually I have
        a confession to make.   
    Ah?

582
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,600
I'm really Dr. Frasier Crane,   
practicing psychiatrist.

583
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,800
Clowning is     
                my avocation.

584
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
And, Ms. Howe,

585
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I will be sure to       
        mention to my husband

586
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,400
the splendid work     
          you did on this party.

587
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
Thank you, Mrs. Ridgeway.

588
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,600
Now, if you will       
         excuse me for a moment.

589
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,900
You have no idea                
how lucky we are.

590
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,100
That was Woody                  
on the phone.

591
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,500
He called                       
to check up on us.

592
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,800
That handkerchief               
is a trick handkerchief.

593
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,600
If you had pulled               
that out of your pocket,

594
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,000
your pants would have fallen    
down around your ankles

595
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,400
and then we would've seen       
those skimpy underpants.

596
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Oh, good Lord.

597
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
That's not the half of it.

598
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
You see, I took off that    
    little French torture device

599
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,000
that Lilith got me
              earlier today.

600
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,600
I've been doing this
            al fresco.

601
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,100
Dr. Crane,

602
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
would you come here
             for a moment?

603
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,200
I'd like you to
                 meet my mother.

604
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,400
Why yes, I'd be delighted to.

605
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,900
I've heard such wonderful things
        about her.

606
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
( <i>sneezes</i> ) 
    Gesundheit, madam.

607
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Here's my handkerchief.

608
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,200
REBECCA:
                        No!

609
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,900
( <i>woman screams, loud thud</i> )

610
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,700
MRS. RIDGEWAY:         
         <i>Mother? Mother?</i>
