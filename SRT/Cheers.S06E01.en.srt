Can't believe the number        
of changes around here.

140
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,600
Thank God                       
you're still pregnant, huh?

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
                ( <i>laughing</i> ):   
                Yeah.

142

( <i>chuckling</i> )

143
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Who's the lucky guy?

144
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Everybody but Eddie LeBec.

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
        Eddie.

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,900
    Yeah. You thirsty?          
    I'll get you a seltzer.

147
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
Yeah, get me                    
something to drink here.

148
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
              Sam, what happened

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
 to your around-the-world sail?

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,700
     Well, it kind of lost      
some of its appeal, Woody,

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,700
         after I sank.

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
              ALL:              
          Sank? Where?

153
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
  Somewhere in the Caribbean.

154
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, you must                  
feel terrible.

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
     Well, no, not really.

156
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,200
        You know,               
 a lot of good came out of it.

157
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,100
I discovered a reef

158
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,600
that nobody                     
had ever heard of,

159
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
  and even named it after me.

160
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,800
    "No Brains Atoll."

( <i>Woody joins in</i> )

163
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
         Maybe you two          
should start calling each other

164
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
        in the morning.

165
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
                          Sammy,

166
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,300
                 it's part of   
                 the new regime.

167
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,200
      They're running this joint
      like a military outfit.

168
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
     Well, that's too bad.

169
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,900
Oh, no,                         
look at that.

170
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,200
What happened                   
to my photograph?

171
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,500
          Never mind;           
        now you're back,

172
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
                you can buy     
                back the bar,

173
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
              things can be     
              the way they were.

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,700
I don't have enough money       
to buy back an ice cube.

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,600
But anyway, you know, hey,      
I just want to work here.

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
                    If I can't  
                    be the boss,

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,000
          I can at least be the 
          highest-paid employee.

178
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,400
Yeah, well, I don't know.

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
We got two bartenders           
already, Sam.

180
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
            You're kidding. Who?

181
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,600
Well, hold onto                 
your sides.

182
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm going to introduce you      
to Mr. Chucklepuss.

         this is Wayne;         
    Wayne, Sam Malone.

186
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,100
    How do you do?              
                    Hello.

187
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,600
 Sorry, Wayne, but Sam is going 
     to take over your job.

188
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, well,                     
there's no reason

189
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,900
why you can't hang around

190
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,700
and be a relief bartender.

191
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,000
            I'm hardly a        
            relief bartender.

192
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
      Yeah, that's right.

193
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,300
             You know, uh, Wayne

194
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,100
              has bored the hell
              out of people

195
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,200
      in some of the finest bars
      and restaurants in Boston.

196
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,600
          And as he'd be the    
          first one to tell you,

197
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,700
             he can make any    
             drink known to man.

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,100
Oh, is that right?

199
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,700
Try me.                         
            Okay.

200
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
        Um, a moonbeam.

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,100
With or without                 
curaçao?

202
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
              Serendipity, neat.

203
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
That only comes with ice.

204
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,600
                Saddleback.     
Onion or olive?

205
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,300
            Both. Stick 'em     
            in your nostrils.

207
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,100
    Well, that's all right.

208
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,500
             What the hell, I'll
             just come at this  
             from another angle.

209
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
         Uh, who's, uh,         
  who's running the show now?

210
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,600
    Oh, no, no, I-I wouldn't    
     approach it that way.

211
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,800
No, this new manager            
eats live sharks for breakfast.

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,300
Ah, but don't go by me.

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
I've hated every boss           
I've ever had.

214
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,000
        How can you say that?

215
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
                I was your boss.

216
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,200
    Yeah, right.

217
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,000
             Oh, I was; come on.

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
Anyway,                         
I really hate her.

219
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,100
     "Her"? Whoa-- a woman?

220
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
      Oh, is she married?

221
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,300
Who'd marry her?

222
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,600
      An unmarried woman.

223
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,400
     Might take me all of five  
     minutes to get my job back.

224
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
    Ha-ha-ha.

225
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,100
                      Why? What?

226
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Oh, no, what, is she            
one of those pasty-faced

227
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,300
little business school          
graduates with thick glasses

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
and her hair pulled back        
so tight

229
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,700
she hears through her eyes--    
one of those?

230
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,000
         She's coming right now.

231
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,800

              the judge of that?

233
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
    Watch this.

234
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,600
        I came up               
    with a few new grabbers

235
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,400
    while I was out at sea.

236
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,400
        Mm-boo-ah.

237
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,800
    Miss Rebecca Howe,          
          Sam Malone.

238
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,400
    Sam, Rebecca Howe.

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,700
How do you do?

        Ah-voo-ah.

241
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,700
    And to you.

242
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
If you'll excuse me.

243
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
    Boy, you know,

244
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,700
she's almost as great-looking   
as I am.

CARLA:                          
Almost.

246
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,500
Gee, I wonder what              
she'll make me for breakfast?

247
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,800
         Miss Tortelli, you have

248
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
        a couple of customers   
        in the corner

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,300
    that look like they're on   
    the verge of a good time.

250
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,000
  You better hurry over there   
 and put your usual stop to it.

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,700
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,000
                 Good afternoon,
                 Miss Howe.

253

    Hello, Woody.

254
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,700
         I mean Wayne.

255
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,600
          Did you lose          
      your name tag again?

256
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,900
                        Yeah.

257
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
        But I found my pants.

258
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,100
Keep up the good work,          
Woody.

259
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,800
Uh, excuse me.

260
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
Um, I want to apologize

261
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,800
for my behavior                 
back there.

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,100
    I was led astray.

263
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Somebody told me that you were  
kind of a schnauzer.

264
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,600
                Uh-- Sam Malone.

265
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
        Yes. Yes.               
            You're the gentleman

266
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,900
                that used to    
                own this bar.

267
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,000
    Well, I heard you were      
    sailing around the world.

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Well, I was going               
to do that, but, uh,

269
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,500
something                       
kept pulling me back here,

270
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,300
and I just couldn't figure out  
what it was, till now.

271
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,800
              Which reminds me  
              of the other thing
              I heard about you.

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,900
( <i>chuckling</i> ):                  
Oh, no...

273
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,600
        Wait, let me set        
the record straight here.

274
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,300
        There have been         
      a lot of ridiculous,

275
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,200
unbelievable rumors             
about my sexual prowess.

276
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
    I just want to tell you     
    that most of them

277

    are right on the money.

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
     You know, Mr. Malone,

279
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,300
     we've known each other     
         only seconds,

280
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,400
 and I'm already tired of you.

281
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,900
Uh, w-w-wait                    
a minute,

282
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,300
         wait a minute.

283
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,400
I know                          
you think you've had

284
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
  just about enough excitement  
          for one day,

285
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
    but there's more.

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm back... and I'm ready       
to jump behind the bar.

287
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,400
            We're fully staffed,
            Mr. Malone.

288
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
            Jump somewhere else.

289
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,300
  Uh, well, hold on a second.

290
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,800
Can't we, uh,                   
can't we discuss this?

291
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,100
                We just did.

292
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
No, no, no,                     
I meant someplace private

293
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,300
where we could                  
slip out of our things

294
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,500
and say howdy.

295
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,200
                    REBECCA:    
                    I don't know

296
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,500
                if I find       
                your come-ons

297
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
                disgusting or   
                merely pathetic.

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,800
            I do know you're    
            giving me a headache

299
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
                behind the eyes.

300
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,900
                 It feels like  
                 a little insect

301
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,300
        boring into my brain.

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
             Oh...!

303
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
    You didn't knock.

304
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,100
             Habit.

305
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,800
    Oh, my God.

306
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,500
Boy, this place                 
doesn't even look

307
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,800
like my office anymore.

308
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,100
Thank you; it wasn't easy.

309
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,400
     How could you do this?

310
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,400
            I mean,             
  you-you took away all the...

311
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,300
all the charm,                  
all the warmth.

312
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,600
Where's Dave?

313
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
                "Dave"?

314
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
    My moose head.

315
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,700
        I set him free.

316
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,800
    If he really loves you,     
        he'll come back.

317
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
          This is, uh,          
a lot of changes to absorb

318
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
in such a short time here.

319
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Would you just get out of here?

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,300
         ( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
    Oh, hey, come on.

321
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,500
          Lighten up.

322
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,100
         Running a bar          
    should be fun, you know?

323
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
              No, visiting a    
              bar should be fun.

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
                Running a bar   
                is hard work.

325
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
  Mr. Malone, I have had a great
  deal of training and education

326
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,800
        to get to this point,   
        and it's important to me

327
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,400
                that I succeed; 
                that <i>it</i> succeed.

328
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
Well, in that case,

329
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,900
          you're missing a great
          opportunity here.

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
        You see, having a sports
        celebrity in the bar

331
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,000
          is great for business.

332
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
I mean, you take a look         
at your, uh...

333
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,900
You take a look                 
at your, uh,

334
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,200
at your major places            
in Atlantic City.

335
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,800
They got your Willie Mays,

336
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,300
your Mickey Mantle...

337
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
            It seems            
a critical difference here

338
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,600
    is that I've heard          
        of those people.

339
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
    Oh, now...

340
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
Wait a second here.

341
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,400
You know, a lot of people       
may not know this,

342
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,400
but I happen to be              
quite famous.

343
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,200
          Well, I don't care if 
          you're famous or not--

344
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
    I don't need a bartender.

345
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,900
But you're                      
perfectly welcome

346
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
to come here                    
as a patron anytime.

347
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,900
And I personally                
guarantee

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,900
you'll be treated               
with every courtesy.

349
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,000
Unless you're waited on         
by Miss Tortelli.

350
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,700
Now, if you don't mind...

351
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,400
Wait-wait a second here.

352
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,900
        Um...

353
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,000
I sold this bar

354
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
because it had a lot of, uh,

355
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,500
bad memories for me.

356
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
But once I got away from it,

357
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
I realized that it had

358
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,000
a lot of good memories, too.

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
    Mr. Malone, I really...

360
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,300
Please, please listen.

361
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm not enjoying this, either.

362
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
There was, uh, one memory

363
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,400
in particular that

364
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,100
                I have been     
                trying to shake.

365
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,900
            ( <i>clears throat</i> )

366
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
                 See, I was, uh,

367
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,600
                I was afraid    
                that I was gonna

368
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,500
            walk in here        
            today, and, uh...

369
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,400
          see her face          
      everywhere I looked,

370
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
  but instead, what I saw was

371
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
    all these silly changes     
    you made in here.

372
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,100
I happen to think it's...

373
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,700
                 No, no, I mean,
                 it was good.

374
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,600
                It helped me.

375
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,500
Look, what I'm trying to say is,

376
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
         uh, this place         
      is the closest thing

377
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,400
     I have to a real home.

378
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,600
      I want to come back.

379
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,900
            Please.

380
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm very sorry, Mr. Malone.

381
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,400
I wish that I could help.

382
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,200
I see.

383
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,500
         Wait a minute.

384
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,500
            I guess we could use

385
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,600
    another relief bartender    
a couple of nights a week.

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
      Well, it's a start.

387
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,500
    I appreciate that.

388
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
    Don't mention it.

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,900
 You've had some tough breaks.

390
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,900
     Oh, not so bad really.

391
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,300
    You lost the bar.

392
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
      And now you tell me       
    that's your home.

393
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
You lost your girlfriend.

394
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,100
      And I guess you were      
    some sort of an athlete

395
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,200
                    who's having

396
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,100
        a lot of trouble        
        getting over it.

397
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,400
                         Anyway,

398
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,900
    I just hope working here

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,500
     can help fill a little     
    of the emptiness.

400
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,300
 Yeah, well, I'm sure it will.

401
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
         Thanks again.

402
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,800
You're not doing this           
out of pity, are you?

403
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,000
             Pity?

404
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Well, yeah. I...

405
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,400
I can't take this job           
if it's just pity.

406
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,400
      It's not just pity.       
    There are other things.

407
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
        Oh. Well, good.

408
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,700
        Like what?

409
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
            Like...

410
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
        It's pity.

411
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,700
Just pity?

412
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,400
        Just pity.

413
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,800
          No respect?

414
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
              No.

415
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,400
    No personal value?

416
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,400
Do you like my shirt?

417
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,800
Actually, that's a great shirt.

418
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,700
Well, you know                  
what they say.

419
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
Uh, pity and a nice shirt,

420
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
and the world's                 
your oyster, huh?

421
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,300
        Well, uh, I got the job.

422
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,500
        All right.              
Wow!

423
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,700
Great.

424
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,400
            Well, it's-it's only
            part time, you know.

425
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,300
            I mean, you do      
            have two bartenders.

426
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Yeah, well,                     
maybe not for long.

427
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,000
I've already launched

428
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
"Operation Wayne                
Down the Dwain."

429
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,700
Our boys are in the air.

430
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,800
        ( <i>phone rings</i> )         
            What do you mean?

431
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,900
                          Wha...

432
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Cheers.

433
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,100
      Mr. Malone, will you      
     fill out this W-4 form

434
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
        and return it to me?    
                        You bet.

435
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
    Mr. Drake for you.

436
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
         Give it to me.         
    No, wait a minute.

437
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,100
I'll get it in my office.

438
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
      I locked myself out.

439
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,800
         No, I didn't.

440
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
         Well, so much          
     for her dress shield.

441
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
                    ( <i>chuckles</i> )

442
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,100
                        Why?

443
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,500
        Who-who's this, uh...

444
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,800
        who's this Drake guy?

445
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,700
He's vice president of the      
corporation you sold out to,

446
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
and she's got a third-degree    
case of the hots for him,

447
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,400
and he doesn't know she's alive.

448
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
                 Yeah, I have my
                 doubts myself.

449
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Mm.

450
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,700
                 Hey, Carla, you
                 used to, uh,

451
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
            listen in on my     
            phone conversations.

452
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Never. I'm insulted.

453
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
                Show me how to  
                do it, will you?

454
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,400
Just press that third button,

455
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,600
pick up the receiver.

456
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,200
Well, no, I have not sent       
that statement over yet,

457
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
  but I'll send it right away.

458
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,000
      No, it's no problem,      
          I love you.

459
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
      I mean, I'd love to.

460
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,600
          I'd love to.

461
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,700
        Oh, by the way,         
I hired a new relief bartender.

462
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,500
  Kind of a sad case, really.

463
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
          Sam Malone.           
  Used to play for the Red...

464
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,500
        Yes, that's him.

465
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,400
    Well, of course I tried     
     to get him full time.

466
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,300
    Wonderful drawing card.

467
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
        Yes, sir.

468
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,800
    I'll sweeten the offer.

469
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
        Of course.

470
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,500
        Thank you.

471
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
        Good-bye.

472
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,900
             Rats.

473
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,200
          Mr. Malone?

474
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,700
 May I speak with you a moment?

475
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,900
    Sure, what's up, Becky?

476
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,200
I've just been                  
in there thinking.              
                    Mm-hmm.

477
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,100
You know, maybe I'm cutting off

478
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,800
     the bar's association      
    with sports too quickly.

479
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
    Oh, I don't know, Becks,

480
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,700
          I think you were right

481
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,800
      in the first place.

482
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,500
        Besides, I, uh,         
I don't think I could live

483
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,900
on a relief bartender's salary.

484
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
        Well, what if I         
      made you full time?

485
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
 I don't think I could survive

486
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,200
      on a full-time bartender's
      paycheck, either.

487
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,400
Does that, uh, include          
all the usual perks--

488
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
medical,

489
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
            dental,

490
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,000
          horizontal?

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
        Mr. Malone, we can      
        discuss the terms later.

492
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,000
             The important thing

493
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
              is that you come  
              back to work here.

494
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,300
    Oh, I don't know.

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,100
                 ( <i>lackluster</i> ):
                 Please.

496
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,500
Since you're                    
practically begging--

497
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
      Ha!-- yeah, I guess       
     I could take the job.

498
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,500
Uh, you know, I'm gonna

499
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,600
hate the see Wayne              
hit the streets.

500
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
                Yes, I agree.

501
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,500
        Woody, may I see you    
        in my office, please?

502
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,600
You bet, Miss Howe.

503
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,800
            SAM:                
            No, no, wait, uh,   
            no, not Woody.

504
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
Uh, what about Wayne?

505
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,700
      I happen to think Wayne is
      a very talented bartender.

506
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't think he's so great.

507
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,500
            No, Ms. Tortelli?

508
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,700
                          CARLA:
                          No.

509
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,200
I bet there are a lot of drinks 
he doesn't know how to make.

510
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Impossible.

511
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,900
I know every drink there is.

512
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
            Oh, yeah?

513
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,700
  I say that a customer is gonna
  come into this bar tonight

514
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,200
          and order a drink     
          you've never heard of.

515
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,000
No way, never happen.

516
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,400
            Well, if it does,

517
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,100
        will you take a hike?

518
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
All right.

519
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,200
And if I win?

520
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
    Then you get Sam's sailboat.

521
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,200
                      Deal, Sam?

522
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,000
                    It's a deal.

523
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,900
You're on.

524
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,000
I love sailing.

525
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
        Oh.

526
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,200
    This looks like a nice,     
        friendly tavern.

527
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,900
  Heck, I'll give it a chance.

528
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,100
        Norm!

529
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,000
      Not now, you idiot.

530
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,700
        Yes, sir.

531
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,800
                      Let's see.

532
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,100
                What do I       
                feel like today?

533
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,300
                What am I in    
                the mood for?

534
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,200
    I guess a, uh,              
    Screaming Viking'd do it.

535
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,100
                Don't you, uh

536
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,900
          mean a Laughing Swede?

537
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,500
                    No.

538
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,100
What's the matter, Wayne?

539
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,500
You heard the man.

540
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
                 That drink     
                 does not exist.

541
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
                  There's been  
                  many a morning

542
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
                  I wished to   
                  God it hadn't.

543
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,500
    I've never heard            
    of that drink,

544
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,000
    and no one                  
    else has, either.

545
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,400
                  This gentleman
                  made it up.

546
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,900
             Do I have to take  
             my business else...

547
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,500
            No, please, sir.

548
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400
    Excuse me, Miss Howe,       
    I can make that.

549
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
 You want the cucumber bruised?

550
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,700
                    Slightly.

551
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,100
Shall I get your coat, Wayne?

552
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,900
     There is no such thing     
     as a Screaming Viking.

553
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,400
    I assure you, Miss Howe.

554
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
        Screaming Viking        
    over here, please.

555
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,700
  I don't know what's going on  
here, but I've been a barten...

556
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,200
    Bartender, make it two.

557
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,900
        Coming right up.

558
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,300
WAYNE:                          
Wait a minute!

559
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
     There is no such drink     
    as a Screaming...

560
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,000
     Uh, I think I'll have      
      a Screaming Viking.

561
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Although, the, uh...

562
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,600
    the name itself             
    is a misnomer,

563
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,100
    since the Vikings           
    were not actually

564
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
    the murderous plunder...

565
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,700
Would you shut up!

566
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,000
And welcome, stranger.

567
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
            You know what I'm   
            in the mood for?

568
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,400
Screaming Viking.

569
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
            PATRONS:            
    Screaming Viking!           
    Screaming Viking!

570
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
         Yeah, Screaming Viking.

571
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,400
    Screaming Viking!           
    Screaming Viking!

572
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,600
        Miss Howe!

573
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
        I'm sorry.              
    I gave it a shot.

574
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
         But obviously,         
         I am not liked

575
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,300
by the customers                
or the employees.

576
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,800
Screaming Viking!

577
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,300
I haven't been called that      
      since my honeymoon.

578
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Mr. Malone?

579
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,000
May I see you in my office?

580
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,900
          Yes, ma'am.

581
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,500
                    Whoo-hoo.

582
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,700
Here's to the best              
Screaming Viking in town.

583
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,800
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )

584
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,600
    ( <i>all grumbling</i> )

585
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,300
                    Here you go.

586
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,900
What's this?

587
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,200
              A severance check.

588
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,900
        Please be a stranger.

589
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
          Why? Wha...

590
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
         What did I do?

591
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,000
  In baseball-ese, Mr. Malone,

592
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,300
    you showed me up.

593
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,700
                You and the rest

594
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
of the katzenjammer kids.

595
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,100
        Good-bye.

596
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
      Now, wait a minute.

597
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,200
  What about that conversation  
    you had with your, uh...

598
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,100
            My what?

599
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,700
        Your-your heart.

600
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
          Your heart.

601
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
         Y-You pity me.

602
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,700
    You've spent your pity,     
          Mr. Malone.

603
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,600
          Okay, fine.

604
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,100
    Yeah, you know, I don't     
    want your pity, anyway.

605
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,300
You know, I can live            
without this job.

606
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,800
I'll find another way           
of supporting myself.

607
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
         And my mother.

608
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,300
        I mean, now that        
  the doctor's only giving me

609
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,600
      six months to live.

610
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,500
Come on!

611
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,800
Please listen.

612
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,100
I swear to you, nothing like    
this'll ever happen again.

613
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Come on, a decent boss          
would give me a second chance.

614
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,000
And I'll tell                   
you something, I...

615
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,900
Don't say, "A guy would."

616
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,900
      I wasn't gonna say,       
         "A guy would."

617
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,700
         But he would.

618
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,300
        All right.

619
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,800
 I'll give you another chance.

620
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
     All right, thank you.      
        Thank you.

621
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,300
        But I want to make      
        something very clear.

622
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,900
Okay.

623
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
                You've just got 
                one chance left.

624
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,600
Mm-hmm.

625
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
                 And as far as  
                 I'm concerned--

626
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,500
        again, in baseball-ese--

627
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,000
it's the bottom of the ninth,

628
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,500
            you've got two outs,

629
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,700
                    two strikes,

630
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,600
            and no balls.

631
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
Okay, all right.

632
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm still at the plate,         
though, right?

633
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,300
                Right.

634
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,500
All right.

635
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
    Now, I think Woody          
    would probably appreciate

636
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
        a little help out there.

637
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,400
Can...

639
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,600
         Can I ask you          
     just one small favor?

640
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,700
             What?

641
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,800
      Can I see you smile?

642
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,000
              Why?

643
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,700
     You know, it'd just be     
      a friendly gesture,

644
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
            to prove            
  there are no hard feelings.

645
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
Oh, come on,

646
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,900
 I bet you're the kind of girl

647
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
     that lights up a room      
        when she smiles.

648
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,000
         That's stupid.

649
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,100
  I'll give you a little help.

650
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Watch this, watch this.

651
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
              Hmm.

652
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,500
    Gee, I was wrong.
