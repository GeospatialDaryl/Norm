1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,432
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,399
You go all over town...

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,835
There ought to be a law.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,232
- Bunch of meatheads.
- So it's true.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,710
He keeps on talking
even when people aren't there.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,192
Yes, but if no one's there to hear it,
does he really make a sound?

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,270
Cliffie, is it worth my asking
what the problem is?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,317
Yeah, Norm, it's my transmission.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,755
Spend day after day taking it
to garages all over town,

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,673
- nobody can fix it.
- Here we go, Cliffie.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,718
Pierson's Garage, Braintree.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,199
They can fix anything. All right?

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,158
Yeah, well, yeah.
Thank you very much, Normie.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,437
You know, my toaster's on the blink.
You think they could fix it?

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,430
Well, only if you got one in your car.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,670
See, they're
auto mechanics, Woody.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,832
Oh, great, it's in
the back seat right now.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,912
All right, all right. Take it easy, Norm.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,559
The kid's good, but you can take him.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,678
All right, I have to select my
words rather carefully here.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,359
Woody, they can fix only those things
that originally came with the car

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,509
when you bought it.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,989
As far as I know, cars don't come
with toasters.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,151
Well, mine did.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,512
It was part of a
promotional campaign.

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,110
You know, if I'd bought a convertible,
I'd have got a food processor.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,315
Ask for Luis.
He doesn't speak English.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,191
Woody, whisky neat.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,517
Frasier, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a date tonight.

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,672
I did, but when I showed up,
she was in the middle of a shower.

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,079
Well, couldn't you wait?

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,674
It was her bridal shower.

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,278
Next time I make a date two months
in advance, I'll call to confirm.

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,469
Afternoon, everybody.

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,518
- Hey, Sam, how were the mountains?
- It rained all weekend.

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,669
Sam, you forgot this.

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,757
Yeah, thank you.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,356
In other words, it was great.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,195
Hey, Diane, how you doing there?

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,232
How am I doing?

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,631
Did you ask me how I'm doing?

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,513
No, not me. That was Woody.
He's a ventriloquist.

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,035
Why? What's the matter?

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,151
- Last week...
- Yeah?

45
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,232
...we were at passion's portal...

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,277
...standing on the threshold of a new
and excitingly textured relationship.

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,830
We were about to open the door
on a brand-new beginning for us.

48
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,758
Well, I knocked at the door,
but nobody was home,

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,798
so I went to the mountains
with the girl next door.

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,798
I see.

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,633
Apparently last week meant
more to me than it did to you.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,469
Come on, what are you doing here?

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,154
Are you saying that even though
we're not really going together,

54
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,117
you want me not to date
anybody else?

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,198
It's not what I want, Sam.
It's what you want that's important.

56
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,152
Well, good. Because what l
wanted to do

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,356
was go to the mountains
with Andrea.

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,756
Very well. Let's just forget
the whole thing.

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,430
Oh, come on, Diane.
It was just physical.

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,637
I mean, that stuff doesn't
mean anything to me.

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,839
Come on, don't you see what I'm
doing here? I'm just honing my skills

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,878
for that magical night that you
and I hit the sheets running.

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,912
Sam, you and I will couple when 1,000
ice ages have come and gone.

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,830
All right. How soon do we
get to play touchy-feely?

65
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,149
Lighten up, will you?

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,958
- Good evening, citizens.
- Looking a little beat, buddy.

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,396
Been staying up late watching
those adult movies on cable again?

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,472
Ma put a lock on that channel.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,319
It's my paperboy, Normie.

70
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,471
He's hitting every place
but the front porch.

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,119
So I got a little plan worked out now.

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,955
All right, get this, 4::30
tomorrow morning in the a.m.,

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,311
I'm gonna put on the old
camouflage jacket,

74
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,072
stick a couple of branches
behind my ears,

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,912
and duck in the rhododendron bush.

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,832
He's smart, but I'm
a little bit smarter.

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,840
You talking about the kid
or the rhododendron bush?

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,228
I wanna see all my employees
in my office, immediately.

79
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,955
Cheers staff, this means you.
In the office, on the double.

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,238
Hey, come on, you heard me.

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,557
We didn't hear the magic word.

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,876
- Please.
- That's not it.

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,996
Come on, Carla,
what's the magic word?

84
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,515
Money. We all want a dollar.

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,274
Okay, okay, all right.

86
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,914
Come on, come on, here you go.
Here's one for you. Here you go.

87
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,308
One for you.

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,799
One for you.

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,313
Whoa, wait, whoa.

90
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,469
What are you trying to do?

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,278
- Beat me out of a buck here?
- Sammy.

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm here out of a fierce sense
of loyalty as your accountant, pal.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,197
And the dollar is your little way
of saying thank you.

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,954
Well, thank you for coming.

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,636
I want you all to take a look at this
in the newspaper.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,153
It really got me going here.

97
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,112
"Grown Man Lives in Refrigerator"?

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,673
No.

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,915
No, no. Not that part.

100
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,513
Let me see that.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,389
Oh, my God, look at that.
He's got a TV in there.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,670
Sam, what is this about?

103
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,551
Oh, yeah, all right.

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,359
Yeah, column three,
down at the bottom.

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,792
"Don Talbot's Locker Room,
Grand Opening."

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,635
Yeah, not only that, Don has got two
other pubs opening the same time.

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,671
I mean, he's doing
fantastic business here.

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,872
What's this got to do
with the guy in the refrigerator?

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,029
Nothing, Woody, nothing.
This has to do with me.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,474
This has to do with my life.

111
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,511
I mean, Don was up
with the Red Sox for what,

112
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,079
a cup of coffee, for goodness sake.

113
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,674
I was there five years,
and now this clown is a celebrity,

114
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,195
and I'm paying my employees
to come talk to me.

115
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,752
You're gonna be paying us a lot more

116
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,992
unless this conversation
starts getting exciting.

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,549
Okay, fair enough.

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,109
I brought you in here because
I wanna ask you a question:

119
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,236
What is Cheers missing?

120
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,391
A mechanical bull.

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,316
No, Woody, that was one of those
questions you ask

122
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,277
when you don't
really want an answer.

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,913
You mean, rhetorical.

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,034
Yeah, rhetorical, right.

125
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,192
Anyway, what I'm gonna do here,

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,874
is I am gonna come out
from behind the bar,

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,160
and I'm gonna become a full-time
manager/host.

128
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,429
A what?

129
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,995
Manager/host.

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,669
Yeah, I greet people.

131
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,912
No, it's perfect. I mean, let's face it.
I'm recognized on the street.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,232
So is a fire hydrant.

133
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,870
You see, at the same time, I'll be able
to hustle up some more business,

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,636
I'll be able to handle the publicity,
the quality control, handling bookings.

135
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,949
I mean, it's great.

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,473
What do you think?

137
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,353
Is that another rhetorical question?

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,117
Well, yeah, it is, Woody, actually,
because we're gonna do it.

139
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,713
We're gonna start immediately.

140
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,075
Does that mean you
won't be bartending anymore?

141
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,275
I'm glad you asked that.

142
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,396
Now that I've
moved up to management,

143
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,632
we're gonna have an opening behind
the bar, and we're gonna need to fill it.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,234
Wait a minute. You know, there was
a guy in here the other day,

145
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,029
- had an application. He was fantastic--
- Hey, now wait. Time out, Sammy.

146
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,832
Does this mean that you're
gonna be hiring

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,433
- another full-time bartender?
- Yeah.

148
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,636
I have to advise you,
I think that's unwise.

149
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,716
- You sure?
- I'd stake my career on it.

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,677
You're unemployed.

151
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,799
All right, I'll stake your career on it.

152
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,077
You really-- You can't afford yourself
as a full-time host/manager.

153
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,514
No, see, that's the beauty of it.

154
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,797
As manager, I'll be thinking up new
schemes to bring in more business,

155
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,837
but I'll be so darned charming
as the host,

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,389
that people will start bringing in
more friends. It's perfect.

157
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,154
I'll be thinking and charming
all at the same time.

158
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,390
Add chewing gum,
and we can sell tickets.

159
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,514
Sammy, I'm sceptical,
but more importantly, I'm thirsty, so...

160
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,513
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for coming in.

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,998
Ken, don't forget to run a
handkerchief over those shoes.

162
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,474
Mr Malone, they're tennis shoes.

163
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,875
Well, don't spend
too long on them then.

164
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,193
Hey, what's with the spread, Sam?

165
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,152
Well, I really topped myself tonight.

166
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,833
I booked a party in here.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,437
The-- Let's see. The Fraternal Order
of the Caribou's sending a group over.

168
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,631
Great.

169
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,920
A group of loudmouthed, rowdy
conventioneers, drinking like fish,

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,594
swearing like sailors,
and putting their paws all over us.

171
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,036
Yeah, happy birthday to me.

172
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,875
How many are coming?

173
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,508
Well, I don't know. They said they're
sending over a whole herd,

174
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,432
so I guess we're
gonna be swamped here.

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,798
I just hope we have enough food.
What do you think?

176
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,595
Welcome. I'm Sam Malone,
your host and owner of Cheers.

177
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,637
You may remember me
as Mayday Malone,

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,358
the relief pitcher for the Red Sox?

179
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,074
Anyway, I just want you to know
the autographs are free,

180
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,719
but the drinks are gonna cost you.

181
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,478
Make him go away, Neal.

182
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,110
Well, welcome.

183
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,635
Carla, a couple tables over here
you may wanna get to.

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,356
Gee, wait on tables. Is that what
a waitress is supposed to do?

185
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,714
Thanks for the tip, Sam.

186
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,757
Diane, we need a mop
over here, please.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,719
I'll buy the bullets
if you'll pull the trigger.

188
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,118
Shooting is too quick.
I want him to suffer.

189
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,679
Why don't you date him again?

190
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,513
Get it in gear, girls.
We got new customers coming in.

191
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
Not if you greet them.

192
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,749
What?

193
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,114
Sam,

194
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,351
this isn't working.

195
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,919
We've done this for a week,

196
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,911
and I haven't seen
any more customers

197
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,991
than there were before you
took over as host.

198
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,957
In fact, there are less.

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,635
And you haven't come up with
one good idea to increase business.

200
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,559
Tonight's different. I've booked
a whole lodge into this place.

201
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,280
I mean, tonight-- Tonight we're
making Cheers history here.

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,035
A little of the old Malone magic
is beginning to spread.

203
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,157
I could use some of that
on my flowers.

204
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,759
Just--

205
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,399
Well, Woody,

206
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,030
Iooks like the new man behind the bar
is working out pretty well, huh?

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,317
Yeah, he's doing pretty well
considering the pressure he's under.

208
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,358
I mean, after all, working around
a man of my experience

209
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,511
is probably a little bit intimidating.

210
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,439
Good, he seems to be adjusting.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,558
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sam Malone.

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,154
Yeah. Let go of me, you little devil.

213
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,830
Yes, I am. I'm--

214
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,628
- I'm the manager.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,233
- Well, thank you.
- Fred Anderson.

216
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,755
- Social Director, Caribou Lodge.
- Yeah, right. I got you.

217
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,512
- Well, you ready for us?
- You bet I am.

218
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,477
Great, great.

219
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,839
Come on in, guys. Looks clean.

220
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,514
Gather around, employees, please.

221
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,511
Okay, now, next couple hours
it's gonna be hell.

222
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,511
You're gonna be running
your little tushies off.

223
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,796
But tonight, when you put your
head down on the pillow,

224
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,428
you're gonna know it was worth it,
because tonight is the night

225
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,670
that we put Cheers on the map.
Okay, all right.

226
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,392
You guys are the whole lodge?

227
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,558
Yeah, we just got our charter
last week.

228
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,793
You're right, Sam.

229
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,188
We just got on the map.

230
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,638
Cheers, population: three Caribou,
one jackass.

231
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,035
Aren't people like that sad?

232
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,792
Huddled together,

233
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,269
totally lacking confidence
in their own individuality.

234
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,471
And incapable of an original thought.

235
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,916
You know,
as Dr Bennett Ludlow once said,

236
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,436
"I'll speak no thought but mine own."

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,431
All right, I'll admit that things
haven't turned out

238
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,478
exactly the way I planned them,
but it'll be okay.

239
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,359
They'll tell their friends,
and their friends will tell their friends.

240
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,274
Do you have anything else?
I'm allergic to shellfish.

241
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,758
Sammy, I'd face reality if I were you.

242
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,789
You have three guys in bad suits and
enough food to cater the Crusades.

243
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,517
Next to this, Hula Night
was a smashing success.

244
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,352
All right, it's okay.

245
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,751
I know things haven't gone
exactly great up to this point,

246
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,990
but they will, they will.
I'll think of something.

247
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,515
Hey, skimpy outfits
on the waitresses, Sammy.

248
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,716
- That's not bad.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

249
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,872
I don't want people having to look
at something I'm ashamed of.

250
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,792
- You got a lovely body.
- Yeah.

251
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,837
I'm talking about hers.

252
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,758
You see, Sammy,
topless waitresses, scientific fact,

253
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,674
they can deliver drinks faster than
their clothed counterparts.

254
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,154
Just forget it, Clavin.

255
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,756
This is just your slimy way of trying
to cop a look at my tooters.

256
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,679
Well, everything seems to be
running smoothly out here.

257
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,628
Think I'll step in my office
and think up some more ideas here.

258
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,711
I don't wanna be disturbed.

259
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,791
Go away, Diane.

260
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,155
Sam, may I speak to you
for a minute?

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,636
This situation isn't working.

262
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,513
Your schemes aren't working,

263
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,393
and you're driving Carla and me crazy,

264
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,916
and if you continue this
entrepreneurial bent of yours,

265
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,036
you're going to bankrupt the bar.

266
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,475
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

267
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,039
Well, I don't know what.

268
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,031
Well, because you don't
have my brain.

269
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,192
Well, whoever has it
should return it.

270
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,959
You need it right now.

271
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,712
Hey, leave me alone, please.

272
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,915
Oh, Sam, I'm sorry.

273
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,718
It's just obvious
what has to happen here.

274
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,199
You have to go back
behind the bar.

275
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,193
I know. I know. I've known it
for a long time.

276
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,038
But why aren't you
doing anything about it?

277
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,113
Well, because doing something
about it means I have to fire Ken.

278
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,393
Right.

279
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,152
And he's such a nice guy too.

280
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,515
Yeah, damn it.

281
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,551
All right, I've put this off
long enough.

282
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,711
Go get Ken.
I'll handle this right now,

283
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,678
and I'll do it quickly,
cleanly and painlessly.

284
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,274
Just like a surgeon. Yeah.
Yeah, just like a surgeon.

285
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,032
Very well.

286
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,112
- He's headed this way.
- All right.

287
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,795
I suggest you start
scrubbing up, Dr Malone.

288
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,318
- Sam, you got a minute?
- Yeah, Ken.

289
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,471
I'd like you to meet my family.

290
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,635
I just want you to know that it was
pretty rough going there for a while,

291
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,678
- for the four of us.
- The five of us.

292
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,872
But thanks to you,
we've turned the corner.

293
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,190
Kids, this is Mr Sam Malone.

294
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,349
- Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,873
Hi.

296
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,274
Well, this-- This is very nice, Ken,
but I do need to talk to you.

297
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,868
Oh, yeah, well, all right,
there you go.

298
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,315
Yes, Mr Malone?

299
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,279
Ken...

300
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,276
...I'm giving you a raise.

301
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,992
That's terrific. Well, thank you.

302
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,718
Thank you, Mr Malone.

303
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,189
Come on, honey, I want to introduce
you to the others, okay?

304
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,634
Okay. Nice to meet you.

305
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,869
Yeah, you too. You too.

306
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,669
- Come on, children.
- We want to stay with Uncle Sam.

307
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,716
- Is that all right, Sam?
- Sure, sure.

308
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,557
Well, quite an operation, Dr Malone.

309
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,993
What am I gonna do?

310
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,878
I can't fire Woody.

311
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,231
Well, maybe if he knew the
situation, he'd wanna go.

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,713
Why don't you just explain it to him,
and let him draw his own conclusion?

313
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,348
Maybe he'll volunteer to leave.

314
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,239
He's such a sweet guy.
I'll bet he will.

315
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,236
Boy, he is a sweet guy.

316
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,436
Of course he will.

317
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,510
Sam, you look quite natural sitting
there with a babe on each knee.

318
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,118
She's seen babes in my lap before.

319
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,355
Yes, but these know
how to tie their own shoes.

320
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,110
Goodbye, you sweet little cherubs.

321
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,076
I don't like her.

322
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,636
Try dating her.

323
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,079
Sam, you wanted to see me?

324
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,912
Yes, I do, Woody.

325
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,834
Say, you know Ken's
two kids here, don't you?

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,513
Yeah, I met them before. Hi.

327
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,829
- Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,592
Yeah. Sit down, Woody.

329
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,395
I called you in here
because I got a kind of problem.

330
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,073
I hope I can help you, Sam.

331
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,435
Well, I hope so too, Woody.

332
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,548
You know, that scheme of mine to
come out from behind the bar

333
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,633
and be a host/manager
hasn't turned out too well.

334
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,916
Well, that's putting it mildly.

335
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,196
But if it means I'm gonna get you
back behind the bar,

336
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,509
then I can't say I'm sorry.

337
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,036
Well, it does mean that you're getting
me back behind the bar, Woody,

338
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,116
but the problem is,
I can't afford three bartenders.

339
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,350
You did meet Ken's kids here,
haven't you?

340
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,790
- Yeah, I did. Hi.
- Hi.

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,510
So, what it boils down to, Woody, is
I'm gonna have to let somebody go.

342
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,952
Boy, that's tough, Sam.

343
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,668
Yeah.

344
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,831
You kids are getting
awful heavy here.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,594
Why don't you go sit on old
Uncle Woody's lap there, huh?

346
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,318
There you go. There you go.

347
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,754
Hey, there we go.

348
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,515
Okay, now, Woody, try to follow
me closely on this, okay?

349
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,231
Now, see, I can't fire myself because,
well, I own the place.

350
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,152
- Well, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

351
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,992
So that means

352
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,638
either you or Ken,

353
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,552
the father of these two kids.

354
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,392
You get what
I'm saying here, Woody?

355
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,879
- No.
- I do. I do.

356
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,718
No, no, no.

357
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,269
Listen, maybe you kids
ought to go now, huh?

358
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,830
Thank you. Bye-bye,
sweetheart, bye-bye.

359
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,509
You're firing me, Sam.

360
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,795
Woody, l-- Boy, I don't know
what to say here, man.

361
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,075
Leave Cheers.

362
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,913
You know, I always thought this job
was just too good to keep forever.

363
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,513
Well, I understand.

364
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,750
You know, I'm young and unattached,

365
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,957
and I can afford to be
out of work more than Ken.

366
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,439
- You are the sweetest guy I know.
- You are too, Sam.

367
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,999
Whoa, what are we doing here?

368
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,593
This doesn't have to be
a big goodbye.

369
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,038
I'll help you find another job, and if
Ken ever leaves, you'll be first in line.

370
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,349
I appreciate that.

371
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,829
Woody--

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,479
No, I know what
you're gonna say, Sam.

373
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,393
Really? I don't.

374
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,591
Well, it would have been great.

375
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,718
I'll see you, Sam.
I'm gonna go get my things.

376
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,551
Oh, boy.

377
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,509
Sam, this has gotta be the
strangest night of my life.

378
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,477
Yeah, it must be
something in the air.

379
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,108
Boy, I don't even know
how to bring this up, but...

380
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,316
Well, there was a guy
sitting at the bar,

381
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,072
said he was from the Harvard Club.

382
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,037
Wait a minute. Here's his card.

383
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,879
Anyway, he said he
liked the cut of my jib,

384
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,429
and he asked me
if I wanna go and work for him.

385
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,273
Now the money he's offering
would be hard to turn down.

386
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,998
- Sam?
- Woody!

387
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,033
I swear to uphold
the bylaws of the lodge

388
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,158
and to defend
the dignity of the herd.

389
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,153
Woody, Woody, Woody. Wait, wait,
wait, man. Wait, wait, wait.

390
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,117
Listen, there's somebody
in the bar here,

391
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,350
somebody from the Harvard Club,
who wants to hire Ken,

392
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,669
so you don't have to leave.

393
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,400
I mean, just get back
behind the bar, man.

394
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,516
God. What a relief.

395
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,035
Wait a minute, Sam.

396
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,559
What?

397
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,598
What do you think I am?

398
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,273
I got fired from a job that
means more to me

399
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,714
than anything else in the world,

400
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,791
and you want me to just come
walking back in here

401
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,793
because Ken wants to leave?

402
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,558
Well, I can't do that.

403
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,955
Listen, I need you.

404
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,430
Please, isn't there anything
I can do to change your mind here?

405
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,031
- Hundred-dollar-a-month raise?
- Hundred dollars?

406
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,913
No, no, Woody, wait, wait.

407
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,672
I need you.

408
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,111
Yeah, okay, a hundred bucks.

409
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,113
- It's a deal.
- Yeah.

410
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,157
All right.

411
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,991
Boy, yeah, you know,
you really surprised me here. I--

412
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,673
You're a pretty tough negotiator.

413
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,674
Yeah, Sam, boy, I know you think
I'm just a country bumpkin.

414
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,470
And the Boyd family may not be too
sharp about a lot of things.

415
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,278
I mean, we don't
know much about math.

416
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,431
We don't know much
about science.

417
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,318
We don't know much
about politics.

418
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,436
We don't know much
about medicine.

419
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,158
We don't know much
about world affairs,

420
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,039
but I'll tell you, there's something
we're pretty darned sharp about.

421
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,599
What's that?

422
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,830
What were we talking about?

423
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,555
Machinery.

424
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,597
We don't know much
about machinery.

425
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,797
I'll tell you, my uncle, he lost his arm
in some kind of contraption--

426
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,313
Oh, you're kidding me.

427
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,669
Wait a minute.

428
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,353
- What? What?
- I remember.

429
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,669
We were talking about money.

430
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,796
That's right. That's right.

431
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,590
We were talking about your
$50-a-month raise.

432
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,551
Sam, it was 1 00 a month.

433
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,869
But you know, I'll tell you.

434
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,279
I think 100 a month is too steep.

435
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,753
- I'll settle for 30 a week.
- You got it.

436
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,190
Host/manager extraordinaire.
