Then, finally,
when he's in his mid-20s

61
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,938
and he comes
to me and says,

62

"Father, let's go hear
Bobby Short at the Carlyle,"

(music stops)

180
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,829
Don't you want
to shake my hand?

181
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,214
She shook everyone's hand.

182
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,717
She even kissed some guy
in the fourth row.

183
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,190
They don't shake your hand
in row YY in the second balcony.

184
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,424
Oh... no.

185
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,960
They'll happily charge you
$28.50 a pop,

186
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,931
but that don't buy no handshake
in double Y.

187
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,401
So Frasier was married
to that-- oh,

188
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,770
how would one
describe her?

189
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,739
Bitch.

190
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,978
Never even told me
about her.

191
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,581
Well, if that's what he wants,
he can have it.

You had to be there.

199
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,308
Boy, never seen this side
of Lilith before.

200
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,978
I like it.

201
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, I know
what Lilith's going through.

202
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,349
When I was in high school,
I used to date this guy--

203
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,984
Corky Pasavak.

204
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,722
He was in drama class, but he,
but he was still real macho.

205
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,357
Anyway, one time he asked me
to go to the movies,

206
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,025
and when we were walking
down the aisle

207
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,994
we ran into his old girlfriend.

208
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,328
I don't even know
why I'm telling

209
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,164
this story;
I mean, I'll just end up...

210
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,032
(quavering):
...getting a lump in my throat,
trailing off...

211
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,568
(sobbing):
...and bursting into tears.

212
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,405
Not this time,
damn you, not this time!

213
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,144
Well, I think that
was a new record.

214
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,347
Where is Lilith?

215
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,748
She's in the ladies' room.

216
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,216
Hey, Fras,

217
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,085
heard you used to be married
to a children's singer.

218
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,119
What's the matter?

219
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,888
Burl Ives
turn you down?

220
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,325
Look, am, am I the only one
who was ever married before?

221
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,960
It's history,
it was a long time ago.

222
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,729
So I didn't tell her.
So what?

223
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,198
Yes, Frasier, but why
didn't you tell her?

224
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,866
Hmm?

225
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,835
Marriage is built on trust,
you know.

226
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,270
You ever told her how
you really feel inside?

227
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,006
Have you ever
shared with her?

228
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,907
Have you ever cried with her?

229
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,143
You're right, Norm.

230
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,644
I should have told her about it.

231
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,348
I, I'll never forgive myself.

232
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,251
That was beautiful,
Normie.

233
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,819
Where'd you get it?

234
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,955
<i>Last week's Matlock.</i>

235
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,024
I don't know what he
got the guy off for,

236
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,292
but that was his summation.

237
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,463
Oh, it's my first husband.

238
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,565
Now, cut that out.

239
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,467
Where's my son?

240
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,502
Where's Frederick?

241
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,037
Did you sell him to the gypsies

242
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,740
so you could spend more time
with Nanny G Spot?

243
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,110
It was perfectly innocent.

244
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,746
Oh, Frasier,
let's just not talk about it.

245
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,648
You say it was
a youthful indiscretion.

246
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,216
I'll take you
at your word.

247
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,319
I can do that because
I'm secure within myself.

248
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,289
I've also had
a wee bit of Dewar's.

249
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,592
So it's...
it's really behind us?

250
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,128
Yes, just don't mention her.

251
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,330
The chapter is closed.

252
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,832
So, in other words,

253
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,735
you don't want her to come
in here and apologize to you.

254
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,869
No.
(door opens)

255
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,571
Hi.

256
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,540
Storm over yet?

257
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,309
Time to make a rainbow?

258
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:23,449
Lilith, I'm so sorry
if I caused you any pain.

259
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,484
I would have hated it

260
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,787
if anybody had kissed my husband
the way I kissed yours.

261
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,456
I guess
I've just always been a...

262
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,857
a kissy person.

263
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,958
(chuckles)

264
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,360
A huggy,

265
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,328
kissy person.

266
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,964
Give me a big hug.

267
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,035
I'd really prefer not to.

268
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,138
Lilith is not
a huggy person.

269
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,042
I know someone who could
never get enough huggings.

270
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,877
Well...

271
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,849
Well, I feel like
I want to hug you.

272
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,684
You don't have to hug back.

273
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,990
(humming)

274
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,192
And you didn't.

275
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,094
Nanny G, I was wondering
if you could...

276
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,363
Lilith, I'd really like
to make this up to you.

277
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,166
...ignore me like
a cheap piece of trash.

278
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,502
"Oh, you could?
Thank you so very much."

279
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,840
I have a super idea.

280
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,109
Frasier tells me you're
having a birthday party

281
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,210
for your little boy tomorrow.

282
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,645
How about if I
come by and sing

283
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,813
for the kiddletinos?

284
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,014
LILITH:
Oh, well,

285
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,649
actually, it's not really

286
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,117
going to be
much of a party.

287
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,686
<i>It's just a small
family gathering.</i>

288
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,554
NORM:
Oh, hey, if, uh,

289
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,889
Nanny G's going to sing,
you know Vera's

290
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,323
nieces and nephews would
love to come.

291
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,391
It is free, isn't it?

292
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,726
Sure is.
CARLA:
Oh!

293
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,861
My God, wait till
the twins find out.

294
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,196
I'll be their hero.

295
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,031
I couldn't get tickets
to the concert.

296
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,534
Guess I should've tried.

297
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,369
It's free, right?

298
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,338
Actually, as much
as I'd love to invite

299
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,906
all of you and
your little folk,

300
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,874
the party's going
to be in our own home,

301
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,444
and, frankly,
it's much too...

302
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,679
well, I just don't
want you there.

303
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,450
Well, I'll tell you what,
why don't we have it in the bar?

304
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,085
Before we open,
tomorrow morning; it'll be fun.

305
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,686
Well, that's settled, then.

306
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,987
See you all tomorrow.

307
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,091
And don't forget
to have goofy dreams.

308
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,627
You know, most people would make
that sound corny, but...

309
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,730
Yeah, well, I'd better, uh,
make some phone calls.

310
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,365
I've got a whole neighborhood
full of brats.

311
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,899
If I bring 'em, they'll, uh,

312
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,568
probably tell me
where my car is.

313
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,339
Darling, are you going
to be okay with this?

314
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,043
Am I going to be
okay with this?

315
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,478
Let's see.

316
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,314
Earlier today I discovered
that my husband

317
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,783
had an ex-wife
he never told me about.

318
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,085
Then I had the pleasure
of watching him kiss

319
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,654
said ex-wife in front
of a thousand children,

320
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,956
including his own.

321
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,525
Then, to top it all off,
she hugged me.

322
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,927
Can you deduce from my tone
whether or not

323
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,397
I'm going to be
okay with this?

324
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,066
Baby, you're the greatest.

325
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,674
Pretty good eats,
huh, Norm?

326
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,008
Not bad for a two-year-old.

327
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,211
I, myself, have been enjoying
these teeny little

328
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,515
tuna fish sandwiches shaped like
tiny little dinosaurs.

329
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,951
Yeah, quite ironic
actually, uh,

330
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>seeing as how tuna, known
in Latin as Pisces middayicus--</i>

331
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,091
roughly translated
as "lunch fish"--

332
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,328
was, uh, was not
a contemporary of the, uh,

333
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,330
prehistoric reptilian
land wanderers.

334
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,067
Hi, pal.

335
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,635
You want some
apple juice?

336
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,670
Okay.

337
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,340
Frasier, where's the Nanster?

338
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,641
Oh, she'll be here.

339
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,710
You can always count on Nanette.

340
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,645
You know, I, I can't
get over

341
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,780
her becoming
such a big star!

342
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,450
Although she always
had a gorgeous voice.

343
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,319
Personality... God,
she'd light up a room

344
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,021
when she entered it.
Really?

345
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,358
I wasn't making a direct
comparison, dear. It's...

346
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,060
You and, you and Nanette
are apples and oranges.

347
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,497
But you are by far
the finer of the two produce.

348
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,632
And which one would that be?

349
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,203
Uh... app-ranges.

350
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,307
Look, allow me to preempt
any further discussion

351
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,975
by simply saying that

352
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,811
you are the love
of my life.

353
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,180
And nobody,
nobody could ever

354
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,683
pry my eyes from
your beautiful face.

355
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,852
She's here!
She's here!

356
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,154

FRASIER:
Isn't she wonderful?

363
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,342
You know, I used
to be married to her.

364
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,344
But now I've got
this honey.

365
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,915
Happy birthday, Freddie!

366
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,617
And...

367
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,952
a big hello
to the birthday mother.

368
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,890
Great, now I'm going
to smell like gingerbread

369
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,558
for the rest of the day.

370
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,926
Cliffie.

371
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,128
Huh?
You smell gingerbread?

372
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,130
Yeah, let's
hunt it down.

373
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,474
My goodness, Frasier.

374
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,911
I can't believe you have
such a big, wonderful boy.

375
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,380
Frasier and I
weren't together

376
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,115
long enough to have
any children.

377
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,384
Although we sure did
try a lot, didn't we?

378
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,955
I, uh, I don't remember.

379
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,226
I do.

380
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,427
Hey, Nanny G.

381
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,363
Hi, I'm Carla.
Hi, hello.

382
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,464
And these are my twins,

383
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,598
Jesse and Elvis.

384
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,600
My, they're glorious.
Thanks, thanks.

385
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,801
They're a little shy,

386
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,803
but they'd both like
an autographed album.

387
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,805
Why, sure.

388
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,575
"Love, Nanny G."
It's for you.

389
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,679
Would you like an autographed
album for your little girl?

390
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:54,947
Oh, that's so sweet.

391
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,082
Twenty bucks.

392
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,986
They grow up so fast.

393
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,726
<i>Oh, sure, she's got lots of time
to hook the little consumers.</i>

394
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,461
Oh, Woody.

395
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,498
Have a Fruit Loop necklace
and chill out, will you?

396
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,266
Come here.
Come here.

397
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,501
Say, Nanny G?

398
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,802
Yes?
Somebody here wants

399
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,971
to meet you.
Come on, come on.
Oh, no, Sam,

400
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,706
you don't have to introduce us.

401
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,341
I recognize this fellow.

402
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,810
The next to last row
of the balcony,

403
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,446
section YY.

404
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,381
I couldn't forget your smile.

405
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,483
Although I haven't
seen it since.

406
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,486
There it is!

407
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,955
I, I...

408
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,857
I love you, Nanny G!

409
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,733
You think he bought it?

410
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,101
Yeah, he's an easy sale.
Good.

411
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,311
Hey, no cuts!

412
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,246
You're not
the boss of me.

413
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,857
You like that stool?

414
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,859
Yep.

415
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,628
Drink pretty good there?

416
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,630
Yep.

417
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,869
Tell you what, kiddo...

418
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,206
Here you go, scoot, go on.

419
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,808
Wish someone
would've done that for me

420
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,477
when I was seven years old.

421
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,949
Mommies, daddies,
boys and girls...

422
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,651
half a bar full of people
I've never seen before...

423
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,720
I'd like you to gather
around here at the steps

424
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,024
for a special sing-along
with Nanny G.

425
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,658
She saw me!

426
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,361
She saw me in the theatre
from a hundred miles away.

427
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,164
She's magic.
Nanny G is magic!

428
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,266
Get a life.

429
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,177
Well, my, my,
my, oh, my.

430
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,379
Well, I was going
to start by singing

431
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,081
"The Doodle Bug Song."

432
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,450
(cheering and applause)

433
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,818
Thank you.
Thank you.

434
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,286
But instead,

435
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,055
I want to begin by singing

436
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,724
a very special song

437
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,760

She isn't looking at me.

444
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,488
She's looking in the general
direction of our loving family.

445
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,491
I think she's singing
the song to you, Frasier.

446
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,892
Oh, you're being paranoid.

447
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,862

I'm sorry,
I can't help it.

Frasier, I've never
stopped loving you.

You know, I'm going to suffer
for this tomorrow,

459
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,327
but today, right now,
this exact moment,

460
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,529
I'm the happiest man on Earth.

461
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,364
Girls!

462
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,004
Well, Lilith, the bleeding's
finally stopped.

463
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,339
(whistles):
Those head wounds.

464
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,808
Serves you right
for trying

465
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,610
to get between us.

466
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,212
Darling, I, I had to stop
the two of you.

467
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,682
Although I must say I was

468
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,917
proud to see you
fight for me.

469
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,219
It made me feel so loved.

470
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,623
Of course, Nanette
was pretty vicious, too.

471
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,159
Oh, but you were
by far the most vicious.

472
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,327
Thank you.

473
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,729
Lilith, I...

474
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:04,897
I should have told you

475
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,266
about my first
marriage before, but...

476
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,134
I just didn't
think it was

477
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,070
relevant to our
lives today.

478
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:14,673
Frasier, I know
why you didn't tell me.

479
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,643
You didn't tell me because
you're a craven coward.

480
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,379
You know me so well,
it's frightening.

481
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,586
Can you ever forgive me?

482
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,555
I suppose I'll have to.

483
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,893
You know, if I must say so,
you hug better than she does.

484
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,862
Frasier, you're such a toady.

485
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,864
Yes, but I'm your toady.

486
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,900
Dr. Crane, I didn't
want to interrupt you

487
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,069

but, uh, I found this box
