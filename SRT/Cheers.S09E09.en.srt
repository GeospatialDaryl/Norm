        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,200
Oh, Lilith.                     

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,800
  Boy, am I happy to see you.   

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,400
      And I, as ever, you.      

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,100
You know, I was                 
cleanin' out my garage,         

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,700
and I was gonna toss            
a whole bunch of old toys       

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
into the Dumpster,              
and then I thought,             

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,600
"Oh, heck, maybe                
the Crane kid would like 'em."  

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,400
                     Oh, goodie!

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,700
                    War toys.   

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,500
Yeah.                           

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
Get a load of these, huh?       

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
                    Ah.         

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,200
                      Little tin
            Confederate soldiers

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,100
                 so my child can
                    have the fun

16
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,700
     of reliving the carnage and
         agony of the Civil War.

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,800
    You bet.                    

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,600
My Gino once did a battle       
of Gettysburg using these       

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,900
and a can of tomato             
bisque soup.                    

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,100
                    Oh!         

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,500
                Here's a cute   
                little dolly.   

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,700
        Yeah.                   

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,100
If you run her along            
the bar, she screams,           

24
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,700
and sparks fly out              
of her eyes.                    

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,700
            Carla, these toys   
              are inappropriate.

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,200
I fear that a child who spent   
      his time playing with them

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,600
        would be in grave danger

28
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,200
            of developing severe
          personality disorders,

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,500
              possibly bordering
            on the psychotic.   

30
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
        Wow! Spark Head!        

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,400
             God, I used to love
          this when I was a kid!

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,300
              Hey, guess who Sid
             and Gladys ran into
                  the other day!

33
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,400
            Hank and Marilyn!   

34
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,200
             (imitates squeaking
                and thudding)   

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,100
                     Through the
                windshield! Aah!

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,300
 Aah! Skidding on the pavement! 

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
            (laughs)            

38
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,500
                            See?

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,100
             Do I want my son to
              grow up like that?

40
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
      (theme song begins)       

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,200

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
             Thanks for dropping
                  me off, honey.

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,100
        Sure.                   
                Yeah.           

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
                  Oh, I tell you
            guys-- man, phew!   

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
        Martha's Vineyard is the
        sweetest place on Earth.

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,000
Bye, Sam.                       

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,900
                    Bye, Martha.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,800
            (laughs)            

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
    Hey, let me buy you guys    
    a round here, huh?          

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
        Hey, all right.         
    Thank you, Sammy.           

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
                    You are in a
                 good mood, huh?

58
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,100
    Well, why not? I woke up    
 on the right side of her bed.  

59
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,400
                        You dog!

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,300
    I know something that'll    
make you feel even better.      

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,500
              Yeah? What's that?

62
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,500
Guess who's taking over         
Melville's today.               
                        Me?     

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,800
                    Wow!        

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,600
John Allen Hill...              
                        Hmm.    

65
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
...Manhattan's foremost         
restaurateur.                   

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,100
              And guess who made
                  it all happen.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,300
Me? Wow!                        

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
REBECCA:                        
No.                             

69
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,600
            Me. I was talking   
                    to Rob...   
Wait, wait, wait.               

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,800
Does this story have anything   
to do with me?                  

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
                        Yes.    
            Wow!                

72
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
Go on, go on, go on.            

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,000
             When Mr. Hill makes
            Melville's the toast
          of Boston's nightlife,

74
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,300
        our little bar will ride
            right along with it.

75
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,800
                         And all
                  because of me.

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Wow!                            
              Wow!              
                            Wow!

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,700
     Guys, check this out.      

78
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
     Kelly sent me pictures     
        of herself              

79
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,600
    all the way from Paris.     

80
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,800
        Ah.                     
                  Oh.           

81
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,200
                    Hmm. This   
                  one's a cutie.

82
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,600
        Ooh! Yeah.              

83
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,800
Oh, yeah, that's her on her bed 
in the... in the convent.       

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,100
                        FRASIER:
                    Looking, uh,

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
        rather fetching         

86
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,700
in an oversized T-shirt reading,
     <i>"Je suis avec Stupide."</i>    

87
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,000
            (laughs)            

88
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,800
            (ribald laughter)   

89
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,800
                    Ooh, la, la.

90
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,000
     So, who do you suppose took
          those snapshots, Wood?

91
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,500
Oh, probably                    
her roommate, Cindy Ann.        

92
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,700
                            Hmm.

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
     Well, I-I don't know,      
             Woody.             

94
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
        There's a thumb         
        in this picture.        

95
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Either it's a man's thumb,      
      or little Cindy Ann       

96
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,800
     could use a big bottle     
     of Nair for Christmas.     

97
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
I can't believe it.             

98
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,700
This <i>is</i> a man's thumb.          

99
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
She's having some hairy         
French guy                      

100
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,200
take sexy pictures              
of her!                         

101
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,600
All right, well,                
two can play at this game.      

102
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,300
I'm gonna have some hairy       
French guy take pictures of me. 

103
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,300
         (door closes)          

104
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm John Hill,                  
your new upstairs neighbor.     

105
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,300
            Oh, hi.             

106
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,400
And you must be                 
Sam Malone.                     

107
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,400
     Yeah. How'd you know?      

108
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
My hatcheck girl                
described your hair.            

109
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,300
She didn't do it justice.       

110
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,700
        Ah. Well,               
     it's kind of a hobby.      

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
The joy it must bring you.      

112
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,800
Well, Mr. Malone,               

113
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
since we're going               
to be neighbors,                

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
I brought a little gift         
for your tavern.                

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,500
            Oh! Look at that.   
                 Hey, all right.

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,900
              It's a welcome mat
              with a duck on it.

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,300
                Look at that.   

118
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,500
        Well, we've never really
        used a-a doormat before.

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,800
                    Well, not   
                counting Clavin.

120
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,600
      Do you, uh... Do you think
         this kind of thing goes

121
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,200
                in a sports bar?

122
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,500
    Oh...                       
                          WOODY:
                        Well,   

123
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
        back in Hanover, duck   
        hunting is considered   

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,400
                      one of the
             manliest of sports.

125
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,700
                We used to do it
                all the time.   

126
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,300
        You-You actually        
    shot ducks, Woody?          

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,500
                         Oh, no.

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
                  It was just an
             excuse for the guys

129
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,400
                 to get together
             and drink hot cocoa

130
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,100
        and blow those little   
         quacker dealies, right?

131
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,500
                    I had the   
                    best one.   

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,200
              I made it out of a
            Good and Plenty box.

133
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,100
        He's cute.              

134
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Does he come with               
his own dueling banjo?          

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,700
Well, Mr. Malone,               

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,500
uh, please make sure            
your patrons                    

137
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,500
use this mat before             
tracking dirt up to Melville's. 

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
                         Oh, uh,

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
      John, you know, I...      

140
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Listen, I really don't think so.

141
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
              Oh.               

142
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
          Well, fine.           

143
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,600
    Uh, oh, by the way I...     

144
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,100
I think this will               
amuse you, Sam.                 

145
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
In looking                      
at the property map             

146
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,500
that came                       
with my title deed,             

147
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,600
it appears that the area        
beyond that hallway             

148
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,900
actually belongs to me.         

149
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,800
    Oh, no, no, John.           

150
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,300
         That's, uh...          
     that's the pool room,      

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
  and those are our bathrooms.  

152
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,000
No, no, no.                     
Look here.                      

153
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,300
You see?                        

154
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,400
Apparently, it was Melville's   
old storage basement.           

155
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,700
                 Uh-huh, uh-huh.

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Don't.... Don't                 
get alarmed.                    

157
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,900
I have no designs on them.      

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I just mentioned it, because    
I thought it was amusing.       

159
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,000
                 (laughs weakly)

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
                That's-That's   
                     very funny.

161
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,700
                        Um...   

162
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,600
                 so, do we still
                  get to use it?

163
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,700
Of course! We're neighbors.     

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,700
Neighbors help each other.      

165
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,300
             Yeah, well, of c...
        Yeah, of course they do.

166
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,100
        Of course they... You   
            know, I got an idea.

167
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,300
    Why don't you let me help   
        you put this duck mat   

168
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,000
            right down at the   
             foot of the stairs?

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
  Well, that's very thoughtful  
          of you, Sam.          

170
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,700
                             Oh.

171
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh, um,                         
one other thing.                

172
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,100
Our, uh, garbage area seems     
to be strewn with beer cans     

173
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,500
that appear to have been crushed
against someone's forehead.     

174
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,700
SAM:                            
Oh...                           

175
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,000
                    I warned you
                     about that.

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,400
Hey, I get crazy!               

177
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,500
            Don't-Don't... Don't
        worry about it, John.   

178
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
        I'll, uh... I'll take   
        care of that right away.

179
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,800
Also, your red Corvette seems   
to be parked in my space.       

180
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,300
                         Oh, no.

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
        Now-Now, John, I've-I've
    always parked in that space.

182
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,500
Not any longer.                 

183
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
                    Uh, fine.   
                  All-All right.

184
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,200
            Uh, I'll move it.   

185
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,700
Of course you will.             

186
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,900
         You know, I...         

187
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,500
          I don't know          
  if I like this guy so much.   

188
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,100
He seems kind of snooty.        

189
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,500
                        He's not
                    snooty, Sam.

190
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,000
             He's sophisticated.

191
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,800
  I think this bar could benefit
         from his kind of class.

192
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
Oh, come on. Cheers is          
classy enough the way it is.    

193
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,700
     (party horns tooting)      

194
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,900
              Have you ever seen
                 so many Yuppies
                with gold cards?

195
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,500
John Allen Hill                 
worked his magic,               

196
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,200
and we reap                     
the benefits.                   

197
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,700
                    I love these
                charge slips.   

198
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,500
                Look at here.   

199
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
                 They put down a
                 five for a tip.

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,600
              Now, all I have to
            do is stick a one   
            in front of it...   

201
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
                ...and I got 15!

202
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,900
Uh, oh, all right, Normie,      
you beat me fair and square,    

203
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,600
so, uh, all right,              
let me buy you a beer.          

204
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
                    Yeah.       

205
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,600
                Um... excuse me,
                    I was, uh...

206
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
            I was sitting, uh...
                  sitting there?

207
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,300
Oh, there was no one here       
        when we came in.        

208
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,300
                     No, I mean,
                      yesterday.

209
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,700
                          And...

210
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,100
            I mean, really since
        the Ford administration.

211
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,300
We're just waiting              
for our table up in Melville's. 

212
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,700
                 So you'll move?

213
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Look, there's lots              
of other stools.                

214
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,000
            Um...               

215
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,300
            (chuckles slightly):
                        Um...   

216
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,400
                 (clears throat)

217
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
                 Look, uh, um...

218
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,100
                     Sounds kind
                     of silly...

219
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
                      I'm, uh...
                    I'm Norm.   

220
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,300
I'm Jeffrey,                    
and this is Hillary.            

221
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,600
    Nice to meet you.           

222
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,300
     What do you do, Norm?      

223
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
                    I sit there.

224
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,500
        (clears throat)         

225
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,300
Well, it's nice                 
meeting you.                    

226
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,800
                  (clears throat
                     repeatedly)

227
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,500
      Look, uh, this is...      
        this is...              

228
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,100
                 (clears throat)

229
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,900
      Yeah. We're runnin'       
    out of time here.           

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,300
    He's-He's already           
        two stages              

231
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,800
        beyond anything         
    I've seen before,           

232
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,200
          so I-I think          
you'd better give him the stool.

233
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,100
            I'm-I'm sorry.      
            We're sitting here. 

234
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,200
                      (grunting)

235
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,500
                      (thudding)

236
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
      Norm? Norm! Norm...!      

237
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,800
  (overlapping crowd chatter)   

238
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Uh, what's all                  
the commotion about?            

239
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,100
                      Who cares?

240
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,200
            Set 'em up, Wood.   

241
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,500
        (phone ringing)         

242
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,400
        (clears throat)         

243
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,800
            Cheers.             

244
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
    Uh, okay, just a second.    

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,700
Armstrong, party of four,       
      your table is ready.      

246
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,100
Uh, have our drinks             
sent upstairs.                  

247
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,600
We'll pay for them              
up there.                       

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,300
Excuse me?                      

249
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,500
      Young man, could you      
  call upstairs and tell them   

250
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
    that we're waiting          
    down in the lounge          

251
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,900
    until <i>our</i> table             
    is ready?                   

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,100
                    Sure.       
No, Woody.                      
Woody, no.                      

253
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
This is not...                  
This is not Melville's lounge.  

254
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
Uh, I got to go talk            
to this Hill guy.               

255
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
        This is getting         
    out of hand here.           

256
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,900
        This is my bar.         

257
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,700
      It's not his stupid       
         yuppie lounge!         

258
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,300
                I think Sam's   
                    overreacting

259
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
                     just a bit,
                      don't you?

260
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,800
          Ciao, gang!           

261
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,400
             CROWD:             
             Randy!             

262
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,700
Times they are                  
a-changin', Mr. P.              

263
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey, Norm!                      
Norm, Norm, Norm!               

264
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,200
    Give me your coat           
    and tie, will you?          

265
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
          Forgot about          
    their stupid dress code.    

266
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,200
            Woody,              

267
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,600
you sent up a party of eight    
without calling ahead.          

268
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,400
              Where is my brain?

269
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,100
                        Oh, man!

270
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,400
     This is going too far.     

271
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Sam! Sam! Sam,                  
stop it. Relax.                 

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Listen, don't let your anger    
get the better of you.          

273
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,100
     That's the worst thing     
        you can do              

274
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,500
                in a business   
                      situation.

275
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Well, maybe                     
you're right.                   

276
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,200
I don't know.                   
It just...                      

277
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,400
You know, it seems to me like   
he's turning our bar into...    

278
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
well, into something            
Diane would have liked.         

279
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,300
                 All right, Sam.

280
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,800
                You hold him,   
                I'll hit him.   

281
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,200
            No, no.             

282
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,600
                     You-You-You
                     were right.
                    Thanks, man.

283
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,400
              You were right the
             first time. Listen,

284
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,400
        I'll just go...         
      talk to him... here.      

285
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,200
     Say, Mr. Hill... John!     

286
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,500
                  Could I have a
        little chat with you?   

287
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,500
Oh, certainly, Mr. Malone.      

288
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
                    John, I'm...

289
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,500
            I'm feeling a little
                uncomfortable   

290
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,800
             with you delegating
            new responsibilities

291
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
                to <i>my</i> employees.

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,200
I understand completely.        

293
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,600
        Oh, good, so it'll stop.

294
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,900
    No...                       

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think I deserve               
a little leeway.                

296
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,500
After all, I am allowing you    
to use that poolroom            

297
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,400
as well as both washrooms.      

298
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,600
            Well, no, no, now   
                  wait a second.

299
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,500
          I could just as easily
    say that I'm allowing you   

300
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
              and your customers
            to use my stairs.   

301
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,400
I mean, look, there go two of   
    your customers up my stairs.

302
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, and there go two of your   
customers into my washroom.     

303
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
      Yeah, well, look, there go
    three more of your customers

304
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,600
              up my stairs.     

305
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,600
Sam, I'm sensing                
hostility here,                 

306
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,400
and, frankly, it hurts me.      

307
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean, especially              

308
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
since I came down               
to do you a favor.              

309
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,000
        Oh. Uh, well, I'm sorry.

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
                Uh, what's that?

311
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,400
I wanted to give you            
the number of the impound lot   

312
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,300
where your automobile           
has been towed.                 

313
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,900
                 What?          

314
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,200
Well, you parked                
in my space again,              

315
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
and I had to have it            
taken away.                     

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,500
             You towed my Vette?

317
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
            FRASIER:            
             Sam...             

318
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,800
                         Sam... 

319
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,200
He towed my Vette.              

320
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
    Well... all right.          

321
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,400
     I'm just... I'm afraid     
I'm gonna have to ask you       

322
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,200
    and your customers          
  to no longer use my stairs.   

323
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
        Don't you think         
    that's a little drastic?    

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,700
          No, I don't.          
    I think it's quite fair.    

325
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
     I mean, it's not like      
  I'm scratching their chrome   

326
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,900
    with a giant metal hook.    

327
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,300
        Very well.              

328
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,300
Everyone, may I have            
your attention?                 

329
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,700
Melville's patrons              
are no longer welcome here.     

330
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,100
    Would you please join me    
            upstairs            

331
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,400
 for a complimentary cocktail?  

332
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,300
SAM:                            
No, whoa, whoa.                 

333
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,500
         Not you, Norm.         

334
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
Carla! Carla, bring me one down!

335
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Hey, Carla,                     
get-get out of line.            

336
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,400
  Well, I think I handled that  
          quite well.           

337
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,800
 Nobody messes with Sam Malone, 

338
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,100
least of all some hairless      
    king of the snobs.          

339
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,500
    Wow, that was a real shot   
     at you from out of nowhere,

340
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
                 huh, Dr. Crane?

341
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,900
          There we go.          

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
Well, congratulations,          
Sammy.                          

343
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,400
     It's been a whole week     
 since you gave Hill the boot,  

344
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,400
and he hasn't retaliated at all.

345
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,700
                Oh, yeah, I know
                 guys like that.

346
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,200
        They're all the same.   

347
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
                You know, you   
            call their bluff,   

348
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,000
pretty soon they crumble.       

349
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
             (thud)             

350
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,300
Can you believe                 
the nerve of that guy           

351
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
  putting up a wall like this?  

352
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,900
          (shouting):           
  ...you know the Constitution  
 guarantees us certain rights,  

353
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,600
     among those the right      
     to go to the bathroom      

354
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,100
  and the right to play pool!   

355
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,400
  Way to tell them off, Sammy.  

356
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
Actually they wouldn't let me in

357
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,900
    'cause I wasn't wearing     
        a jacket,               

358
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,300
      but he can hear me!       

359
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,600
Sam, calm down.                 

360
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,600
      I'm calm. I'm calm.       

361
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,900
            I mean,             
 just according to his lawyer,  

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,500
 that horse's ass is not going  
  to take down that brick wall  

363
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,900
        until I pay rent        
        on the poolroom.        

364
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,200
          (laughing):           
  Ooh, ooh... look what I did.  

365
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,700
 I stole all his dinner mints.  

366
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,600
    I know, I know, I know.     

367
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,100
I shouldn't have done it.       
Yes.                            

368
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,600
    I just let him get to me    
         just a touch.          

369
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,500
     It won't happen again,     
         swear to God.          

370
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,200
Ten bucks says he goes          
ballistic by midnight.          

371
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
 I've got ten that says 11:00.  

372
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,700
Well, uh, I'll take 9:30.       

373
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Hey, Fras, you want in?         

374
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Well, I don't think             
that would be fair.             

375
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
I mean, I am                    
a professional psychiatrist.    

376
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
  Then again, it might give me  
        the edge I need.        

377
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,100
         I say by 8:15          
  he'll be spitting up blood.   

378
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,900
        Dr. Crane,              

379
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
I need your help.               

380
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
 I've been walking the streets, 

381
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
      pulling out my hair,      

382
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,300
bumping into things,            
talking to myself.              

383
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,700
          So, what's new, Woody?

384
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,200
Well, it's Kelly.               

385
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,100
I can't stop                    
thinking about her              

386
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,900
and-and that man                
with the thumb.                 

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,500
Oh, Woody.                      

388
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,700
You've created this whole       
scenario based on what?         

389
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
    A snapshot of an innocent   
              girl in a T-shirt.

390
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
    I mean, look, if you want   
    to straighten things out,   

391
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,100
why don't you just call her     
and talk to her?                

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah, maybe you're right.       

393
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,600
I mean, maybe                   
if I just talk to her,          

394
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
we could clear                  
this whole thing up.            

395
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,100
      But, so help me God       
if a man with a thumb answers...

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
            Hold on.            

397
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
 It's him. It's the thumb guy.  

398
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
 And you know what that pervert 
          said to me?           

399
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,900
            "Allo."             
What does that mean in English? 

400
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,800
         Wait, wait, wait, wait.

401
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
          No, I took some French
                 in high school.

402
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,200
            I think "allo..."   
             "allo" means, um...

403
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,900
                  "I've got your
        girlfriend in my arms   

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,800
and, uh, soon we'll be naked,   
            you stupid cuckold."

405
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,600
That's-that's funny, Norm,      
because I thought it meant, uh, 

406
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,700
"I've got your girlfriend       
in my arms                      

407
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,500
and we're already naked,        
you stupid cuckold."            

408
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,900
                        FRASIER:
             Oh, for God's sake.

409
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,100
  Stop hectoring the poor lad.  

410
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,300
          Woody, it simply means

411
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,000
that "I enjoyed                 
your girlfriend."               

412
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,300
        (laughing)              

413
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,800
All right, listen, Monsieur     
Thumb, you think you got...     

414
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,400
    No, no, no, Woody, Woody,   
Woody, Woody, Woody, stop, stop.

415
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,500
            We were just joking.
        Here let me talk to him.

416
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,500
              <i>Bonjour, Monsieur.</i>

417
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,300
 Eh, mm-hmm,                    
 <i>je suis un ami de Woody.</i>       

418
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,800
 <i>Un petit problème--</i>            

419
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,800
 <i>ma question est</i>                
 <i>le photographe de Kelly.</i>       

420
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
    Uh-huh.                     

421
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,500
    (laughing)                  

422
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,200
     <i>Non. Non.</i>                  

423
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,900
              <i>C'est marveilleux.</i>

424
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
     <i>Merci.</i>                     

425
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,300
    Oh, Woody.                  

426
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,700
It seems that there's a...      
a Monsignor, uh, Pilot,         

427
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,800
a very elderly French cleric,   
who was the one                 

428
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,200
that took the photograph        
of your beloved.                

429
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,100
    Oh, well.                   

430
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,800
Thank you, Dr. Crane.           

431
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
I-I feel a million times better.

432
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,000
  You know what I'm gonna do?   

433
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
  I-I'm gonna... I'm gonna go   
          write Kelly           

434
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,600
  the best darned love letter   
        she's ever had.         

435
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,100
             CLIFF:             
         There you go.          

436
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,800
      (Frasier chuckling)       

437
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,600
                So, uh, some old
             French priest, huh?

438
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
I have no idea.                 

439
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,100
    Apparently, Woody dialed    
      the wrong exchange.       

440
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,800
 Somewhere in Belgium, there's  
  a very confused chocolatier.  

441
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,600
    I'm taking things           
    into my own hands here.     

442
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,400
    I hate that damned wall.    

443
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,600
      I'm gonna put my bar      
      back the way it was.      

444
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,600
Coming out, no more bets.       

445
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,000
          Uh, excuse me, you may
          want to move over here
              just a little bit.

446
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
      Fellas, you may want      
  to take note where you were   

447
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,800
  the day the wall came down.   

448
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
        (panting)               

449
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,300
        (panting)               

450
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,100
        Is it down yet?         

451
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,700
        Mr. Hill, wait here just
    one moment, please, okay?   

452
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,200
Sam,                            

453
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,900
      now I don't want you      
        to be mad at me,        

454
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
  but I brought Mr. Hill here   
 to settle this whole ugly mess 

455
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,300
between the two of you.         

456
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,000
Please say                      
you'll talk to him.             

457
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,900
              Oh, sure, I'd love
                 to talk to him.

458
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,700
                    Not with the
                sledgehammer.   

459
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Aw, I wasn't gonna actually,    
you know, hit him with it.      

460
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,500
I was just gonna drop it        
on his foot by mistake.         

461
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,400
                  No, Sam.      

462
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,200
  Sammy, just let me have it.   

463
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,100
             (thud)             
                    Ow!         

464
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
It would have worked, Sam.      

465
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,900
No, I'll just, uh...            

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,300
      I'll go talk to him,      
    that's all right.           

467
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,000
Mr. Hill.                       

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,100
             John.              

469
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
         I'm glad you came back.

470
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
          Sit down for a second.
Oh, thank you.                  

471
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
     Uh, things have just gotten
    too far out of hand here.   

472
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,700
                I mean, come on,
                we're neighbors.

473
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,000
    We need to, well, we need   
      to learn to live together.

474
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,800
          We-we need each other.

475
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't need you.               

476
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,300
        Oh, God, you're evil.   

477
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,200
         I can't fight the evil.

478
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,300
     I-I... I give up, Mr. Hill.

479
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
        You know,               
    the funny thing is, I...    

480
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
     when I got my bar back     
         just recently,         

481
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,300
  I thought, "Hey, Sam, you're  
on top of the world here.       

482
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,300
      "Your life's finally      
        turning around.         

483
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,000
             You're in charge of
              your own destiny."

484
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
                But I was wrong.

485
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,900
          You have my bathrooms,
                    Mr. Hill.   

486
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,900
         You hold all the cards.

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
              You're everything.

488
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,600
                     You're God.

489
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,200
                    I'm nothing.

490
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,400
            Here's your rent.   

491
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,700
I'm sorry, Sam,                 
I was wrong.                    

492
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,400
I don't want your money.        

493
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,100
                You don't?      

494
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,000
No, I just want you to make     
that speech to me in public     

495
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,600
every month                     
when your rent is due.          

496
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,200
            No, no.             

497
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,000
  I was wrong, you're not God.  

498
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
 You're-you're some big petty,  
         mean nothing.          

499
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,400
        I'll tell... you know   
              I'm gonna give you
          your rent every month,

500
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,900
and every month from here       
on out, and I'll tell you,      

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,300
every time I do I'm gonna write 
        right down here         

502
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,200
        on the memo part        
    "You're not God."           

503
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,700
             There.             

504
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,500
     How do you like that?      

505
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,200
Well, you certainly put me      
          in my place.          

506
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,200
         I'll just, uh,         
    take your money and go.     

507
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,400
    Yeah. Good, good.           

508
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,300
Oh, by the way,                 
when I came in,                 

509
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,600
I noticed they were             
towing your car again.          

510
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,900
        What for?               
  I didn't park in your space.  

511
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
 No, but it was in a fire lane. 

512
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,500
I don't make the rules.         

513
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I just notify the authorities   
when they're broken.            

514
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,200
            Oh, God!            

515
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,500
 Oh, he's making me insane! Oh! 

516
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,000
             I'd say that scream
              makes it official.

517
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,300
                      Woody, who
                won the pool?   

518
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,900
            Well...             

519
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
            Oh, Sam,            
 you aren't gonna believe this. 

520
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,700
          The winner of the $200

521
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,300
             is our friendly new
         neighbor, John A. Hill.

522
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
            (grunts)            

523
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,500
            (yells)             

524
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,700
    He gets paid $200           
    to make me insane?          

525
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,300
No, he can't get away with this.

526
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
     No, this is not fair.      
    I'll tell you something,    

527
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,300
  I'm gonna make him take down  
that brick wall, brick by brick,

528
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,500
      with his own little       
     polished fingernails.      

529
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,300
                I need... I need
                    to get back.

530
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,800
                 I need revenge.

531
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,300
         Ooh, yes, yes.         

532
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
            The mat.            
        The stupid mat.         

533
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,400
  I've always hated this mat.   

534
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
    This is a mat from hell.    

535
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,700
    (grunting)                  

536
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,100
    Never mind. Never mind.     

537
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,900
    Where's my sledgehammer?    

538
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,500
Yeah, die you stupid duck.      

539
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,900
        (grunting)              

540
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,600
CARLA:                          
Sammy.                          

541
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,500
You're not making a dent in it. 

542
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,500
      Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?       
          Watch this.           

543
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,300
        (laughing)              

544
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
        (panting)               

545
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,800
      Burn, Donald, burn.       

546
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,300
        (laughing)              

547
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,100
         It won't burn.         

548
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
Say, this is a pretty good mat, 
        isn't it?               

549
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
    I know what I'm gonna do.   

550
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,700
    I'm gonna take this home    
          for myself.           

551
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,900
      I'm gonna bring back      
    one of those cheap ones,    

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,100
     the kind that wear out     
         all the time,          

553
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,700
 and then he'll have to replace 
    it himself every month.     

554
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,400
             I win!
