Yeah, you betcha.

00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,652
Look at this headline here.

"Suicidal Twin Kills

                      Oh, Cliff,

8
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:20,093
you don't actually believe      
that pack of lies, do you?      

9
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:22,229
    Well, Dr. Crane, it just    
  shows you how much you know   

10
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:24,048
        about free press        
        here in America.        

11
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:26,817
I mean, uh, they can't print it 
     unless it's the truth.     

12
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,151
Well, granted, you know,        

13
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:30,104
     some of these stories      
  might be a bit exaggerated,   

14
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,422
    but, uh, I guarantee you    
      at the core of each       

15
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:33,506
    is the kernel of truth.     

16
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,608
    Allow me to demonstrate.    

17
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:35,843
        Hey, hey.

    Come here, fella.

Listen, I just won              
five bucks in the lottery.      

20
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:41,048
Pass it on, will ya?            

21
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,950
Thanks a lot.                   

22

        The truth

has begun its journey           
now around the bar.

00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,520
             When it returns, it
             may be a little bit

25
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:48,372
      distorted, you know.      

26
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,856
     People will be saying      
          I won $500,           

27
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,692
                maybe $5,000,

00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:52,993
  maybe five million dollars,   

29
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:55,295
      but I guarantee you       
the essence of the message      

30
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,630
    will be the truth.

 to different bars in the area  

54
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,454
        reviewing them.

        Need I say more?        

56
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:34,044
                        Yes.

joke about this.                

62
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:46,390
This really means               
a lot to me.                    

63
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,391

                 about it.

            You remember him?

Well, I'm not saying it is,     
but what if it were?            

69
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,019

        kiss your butt good-bye.

70
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:01,956
Actually, that sounds           

71
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,024
more like a job for me,         
doesn't it?                     

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,312
            What's the matter   
            with him?           

73
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:09,597
He's a hater.                   

74
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:10,815
The guy hates everybody.        

75
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,349
I hate people like that.        

76
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:14,084
                        Yeah.   

77
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,369
             He gave Cheers     
             a really bad review
             a couple years ago.

78
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,221
                     Really bad.

79
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:20,741
                I almost stopped
                coming here.    

80
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,159
        What did he say?        

81
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:23,644
A bar full of bores.

00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,448
    Well, we're under           
      new management here.      

85
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:29,917
 A lot of things have changed.  

86
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,117
Like what?                      

87
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,923
                  We have ferns.

88
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,908
                  Didn't he say 
                  anything nice?

89
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,542
Yes, as a matter of fact,       
he said                         

90
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,845
the one saving grace was        
the refreshing lack of ferns.   

91
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:45,415
            You guys are just   
            trying to rattle me.

With the changes I've instituted

93
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:48,819

     in the storage closet,

00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,153
 everything's going to be fine. 

95
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,523
            86 the ferns, Woody.

96
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,859
                    Hi, guys.   

97
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:57,227
         Oh, Carla, Eddie called

98
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,862
        and said he got a job   
        as a penguin.           

99
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:01,014
             Great!

        everybody?              

101
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:06,503
My husband just hooked on       
 with the Pittsburgh Penguins.  

102

Hey, that's great.              

103
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:10,006
    Pittsburgh-- they're an     
    up-and-coming club, huh?    

104
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,310
     I'd say Eddie LeBec is     
on his way to becoming a legend.

105
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:16,780
 Gee, Cliff, what a great thing 
        to say, thanks.         

106
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:18,665
I meant every word of it, Carla.

Can Eddie get us tickets?       

108
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,104
         You know, what I like  
         best about that team...

109
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,106
What?                           
              is their uniforms.

110
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,024
  I mean, the Penguin uniforms  
        are far and away        

111
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,426
the coolest in the league.      

112
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,527
Hey,                            

113
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,295
        everybody!              

114
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:36,400
             Eddie?             

115
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:37,768
     Who else could it be?      

116
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:41,488
Wow, Carla, are their home      
uniforms that neat-looking too? 

117
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,541
Hey, Carla, listen.             

118
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,742
It's been breaking me up,       

119
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,711
you know, not being able        
to find work,                   

120
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,314
not being able to               
support you and the kids.       

121
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:53,517
It's like I was                 
losing myself as a man.         

122
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,486
Well, now, you know,            
I got a job.                    

123
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,653
Aren't you proud of me?         

124
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:59,440
                 Eddie, take off
                 your beak.     

125
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,159
          This is a joke, right?

126
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:03,593
         You're with Pittsburgh.

127
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:04,878
Pittsburgh?                     

128
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:07,847
No, I'm with

You know,                       
that big ice show.              

130
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,935
They're hiring lots             
of hockey players like me.      

131
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,354
             Hey, at least you  
             won't have to worry

132
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:14,588
                about renting   
                a tux, Eddie.   

133
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:15,972
                ( <i>chuckling</i> )   

134
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,474
Yeah, what are they             
paying you, Ed?                 

135
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,276
Seven, eight fish a day?        

136
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:21,762
  Hey, you guys, knock it off.  

137
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:23,263
He's got himself an honest job. 

138
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,865
         He gets paid.          

139
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,650
                    He, um...   

140
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:28,201
                come on, help me
                out here, man.  

141
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,269
All right, all right.           

142
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,037
      Can it, you clowns.       

143
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:34,140
You know, a lot of people       
criticize hockey players.       

144
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,859
They say they're                
wasting their time.             

145
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:37,410
After their careers             
are over                        

146
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,029
            they're not prepared
            for anything.       

147
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:40,964
             Well, my Eddie just
             proved them wrong. 

148
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,466
Thank you, Carla.               

149
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,652
        You walked around in    
        public in that thing?   

150
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,988
I thought you'd get             
a kick out of it.               

151
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,023
Listen, uh, Carla,              

152
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,725
I got to fly                    
to Seattle tomorrow.            

153
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,845
        You can't fly in        
      that thing, can you?      

154
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,399
No, Woody, I'm going            
on an airplane.                 

155
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:02,536
I know, I mean you're not going 
to fly in that thing, are you?  

156
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,187
                        Seattle?

157
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,989
                 I just...      
                 I can't believe

158
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:07,958
              you're going to be
              that far away.    

159
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,476
It won't be that long.          

160
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,545
Look, I'll call you             
every day.                      

161
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,181
Hey, maybe you want             
to come out and see me, huh?    

162
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:15,999
             Yeah. Yeah, well...

163
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,801
        you know, it's really   
        a long way, Eddie.      

164
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,570
             We'll talk about it
             tonight, okay?     

165
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,004
                What do you want
                for dinner?     

166
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,206
I don't know.                   

167
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,274
I kind of got the urge          
for mackerel.                   

168
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,045
Gee, I'm sure going             
to miss you, Carla.             

169
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,696
             Well, who wouldn't?

170
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,683
             You know, not to be
             overly sentimental,

171
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:35,569
             but you're the best
             husband I ever had.

172
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,370
I'll see you, Carla.            

173
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,205
                 Yeah, see ya...

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,441
                    Penguin.    

175
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,961
      I wonder where couples get
      those cute little names   

176
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:46,730
        they call each other.   

177
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,622
          Well, soon.           

178
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,525
Eddie, look, I just can't       
        fly out of here.        

179
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,327
    Are you forgetting          
    I got seven kids?           

180
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:03,997
    Oh, right, eight.           

181
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,999
         Look, look, I'd love to
         talk to you some more, 

182
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,400
        but Sam's calling me.   
What?                           

183
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:08,635
                    ( <i>stamps</i> )  
    Ow!                         

184
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,138
            Be right there, Sam.

185
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:13,674
          Okay, I'll talk to you
          tomorrow then, bye.   

186
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,876
                 Hey, uh, Carla,

187
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,659
I couldn't help but notice      

188
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,679
      that Eddie calls you      
        every single day        

189
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:19,863
  asking you to go out there,   

190
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,782
    and you just keep           
giving him the brush-off.       

191
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,551
 I mean, hey, what gives here,  
          little lady?          

192
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:25,302
    Drop it.                    

193
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:26,920
Or I'll set                     
your face on fire               

194
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:29,790
and beat out the flames         
with your butt.                 

195
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:35,445
         Well, does that satisfy
         your curiosity, Cliff? 

196
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,630
    Totally.                    

197
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,450
But it does raise               
a series of other questions.    

198
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:42,736
                  Hey, hey, hey.

199
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,488
              That restaurant   
              critic guy's here.

200
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:45,555
Where?                          

201
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:46,373
                     Right over 
                     there, see?

202
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,791
Oh, my God.                     

203
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:48,892
      How do I look, Sam?       

204
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,959
    You've got a little drool   

205
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,194
            on the corner of    
            your mouth there.   

206
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:52,813
        No, no, no, leave it.   

207
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,214
I think I better                
go see what he wants.           

208
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:55,565
                 No, relax.     
                 Carla's got it.

209
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,151
Oh, my God!                     

210
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:04,907
 Carla, you don't mind, do you? 

211
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,143
                     Not at all.

212
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,210
            When you're through,

213
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:09,146
        there's a table         
        of six in the corner.   

214
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:11,781
                    Hello.      

215
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:14,867
    You're Murray Treadwell,    
          aren't you?           

216
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:18,571
    Yes, and you must be one    
    of the Flying Wallendas.    

217
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:22,408
     No, I'm Rebecca Howe.      
I'm the new manager here.       

218
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:24,695
                I hope you enjoy
                your visit here.

219
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,479
      Oh, I'm sure I will.      

220
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:27,213
    Would you like a drink?     

221
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:30,150
That seems vaguely appropriate. 

222
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:32,319
                    I'll get it.

223
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:34,587
    You probably want           
      something specific.       

224
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:37,007
How about a vodka martini?      

225
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:37,874
    Excellent choice.           

226
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:38,959
    Anything special?           

227
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,761
  Stirred, shaken, two olives?  

228
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,345
        A little sword?         

229
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,131
    I'd like it today.          

230
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:45,549
        Coming right up.        

231
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,834
Vodka martini for Mr. Treadwell 
      and make it snappy.       

232
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:51,487
    Oh, no, that's the one drink
    I don't know how to make.   

233
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:00,664
    Things seem to be           
    going very well.            

234
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:02,266
            Yeah, just make sure
            he gets a napkin.   

235
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,318
              We only lost about
              a thousand points 

236
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:05,418
              on that last time.

237
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:07,270
             As if it would have
             really killed him  

238
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:10,173
            to use              
            the paper towels.   

239
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,658
        Thank you, Sam.         

240
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,327
     Here you go, Mr. Treadwell.

241
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,829
     Notice the cocktail napkin.

242
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:21,368
    There's plenty more         
    where that one came from.   

243
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,570
Mm, very nice.                  

244
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,572
            Yes, we make        
            a good martini here.

245
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,373
         Oh, that, too.         

246
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,661
    Very sweet of you.          

247
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,563
Do you have any questions       
         about Cheers?          

248
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:35,014
        Actually, I do.         

249
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,584
      But, unfortunately,       
 I'm running a little bit late. 

250
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,187
    Would you, by any chance    
  be free for dinner tonight?   

251
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,388
            Dinner?             

252
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:45,025
    Yes, it's the third meal    
          of the day.           

253
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,177
    We could find somewhere     
         nice and quiet         

254
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,112
where we wouldn't be disturbed. 

255
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:49,929
      Uh... I don't know.       

256
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,247
You know,                       

257
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:53,967
         the more time          
you and I spend together,       

258
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:57,337
      the happier I think       
you'll be with the review.      

259
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,856
  Will you excuse me a minute?  

260
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,924
          I just want           
     to check my schedule.      

261
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:10,200
             He wants me to have
             dinner with him.   

262
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,035
               That means he    
               <i>expects</i> something

263
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,337
              for a good review.

264
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,938
I'll get the petty cash.        

265
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,210
                        Sam.    

266
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,712
              He wants me to    
              compromise myself.

267
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:26,149
Honey, we all do.               

268
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:27,951
                Why do I even   
                talk to you?    

269
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,286
        I'm not going to make   
        a big deal of this.     

270
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,021
        It's just going to be   
        another business dinner.

271
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,355
        That's all.             
        Everything will be fine.

272
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,423
                Listen to me.   
                Listen.         

273
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:36,042
        If, uh, one thing should
        lead to another tonight 

274
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:37,160
                 and you wake up
                 in the morning 

275
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:38,528
              and find out      
              you done something

276
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:39,562
            you wish you hadn't,

277
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,897
        I just want you to know,

278
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,133
            I'd love to take you
            out tomorrow night. 

279
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,472
So I stand by                   
my original review,             

280
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:50,907
"the Hungry Heifer              
is a trough."                   

281
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,958
                     Okay, fine.

282
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:54,160
     But listen, if you can find
     a better 25-ounce steak    

283
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,262
                 for $1.99, pal,

284
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,662
        you just let me know,   
        all right?              

285
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,702
        I'd be happy to have    
        dinner with you tonight.

286
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:04,271
Great, I'll pick you up         
at 7:00.                        

287
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,305
                    Terrific.   

288
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,672
              I'll see you then,
              Mr. Treadwell.    

289
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,058
Please, call me Murray.         

290
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:14,514
     All right, all right,      
    sure thing, Eddie.          

291
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,917
  Okay, listen, break a wing.   

292
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,018
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

293
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,687
    I know, I know, I know,     
     you hate those jokes.      

294
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,690
    Listen, just keep           
      a stiff upper beak.       

295
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,624
( <i>laughs</i> )                      

296
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:25,758
I'm sorry.                      

297
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,327
All right, bye-bye,             
bye-bye.                        

298
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,828
Oh, heck.                       

299
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,514
     That was your husband      
on the phone there, Carla.      

300
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,183
Why was he calling you?         

301
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:34,601
    Well, he's upset.           

302
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:37,403
    He wanted me to ask you,    
    find out why, you know,     

303
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,905
     you won't go see him.      

304
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,423
How can I, Sam?                 

305
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,326
I can't afford                  
a plane ticket to Seattle.      

306
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,827
    Well, now I could           
      loan you the money.       

307
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:45,779
    Great.                      

308
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:48,098
But who could get               
the time off?                   

309
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,265
If it's for the sake            
of your marriage,               

310
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,767
I'm sure we could               
work something out.             

311
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,402
        If you'd like to take   
        a leave of absence      

312
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:54,103
             for say, a year,   
             that would be fine.

313
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:56,873
I-I really, I don't know        
why everybody thinks            

314
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,475
I could just                    
pick myself up and go.          

315
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,343
I got two newborn babies.       

316
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:02,646
Take them.                      
Tykes fly free.                 

317
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,547
          Yeah, usually in the  
          seat right next to me.

318
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,584
Look, I can't go,               
so let's just drop it, okay?    

319
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:08,618
    Geez.                       

320
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:10,853
Just came up                    
for a drink order.              

321
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:14,190
      Carla, Eddie's afraid that
      you're ashamed of him.    

322
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:16,359
Well, I'm not.                  
                 Well, tell him.
                 Don't tell me. 

323
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,994
    I will!                     

324
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,747
The minute he gets back.        

325
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,699
You're not afraid to fly,       
are you, Carla?                 

326
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:26,403
Me? Afraid to fly? Me?          

327
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:30,590
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

328
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,360
          ( <i>cackling</i> )          

329
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:36,045
     ( <i>maniacal laughter</i> )

                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

331
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,483
Well, it must be something.     

332

                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

333
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,895
    I am not afraid to fly.     

334
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,329
            I'm not!            

335
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:57,067
      I'm afraid to crash.      

336
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,736
            MAN:                
            Did you have        
            a bad experience...?

337
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,104
        Yes, I did!             

338
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,474
First time in an airplane.      

339
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:07,360
     It was on my honeymoon     
        with Nick.              

340
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:11,298
We're going to New York--       
short flight, no problem, right?

341
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,667
Well, suddenly, the plane       
hits turbulence, right?         

342
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:18,071
Me and Nick were thrown         
all around that bathroom.       

343
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:23,343
I haven't flown since.          

344
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,877
            Sweetheart, that    
            was just one time.  

345
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:25,812
            I mean, look at me. 

346
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,013
        When I was playing ball,

347
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,548
            I must have flown   
            200,000 miles,      

348
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:30,583
            and I don't remember
            anything happening. 

349
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:31,918
'Cause you were                 
always drunk.

00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:35,789
                Damn right.

        Good afternoon.         

352
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:37,807
              Hey.              

353
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,225
Oh, hey, Frasier.               

354
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,261
Yeah. You're just the man       
     I'm looking for here.      

355
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,895
You looking for my camaraderie, 
              Sam,              

356
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,064
      or do you want some       
    free psychiatric advice?    

357
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:46,416
            Uh... that          
            free thing there.   

358
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,801
             Good.              

359
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,803
                Come on. What do
                you say, Carla? 

360
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,371
    Oh, no way, Sam. Uh-uh.     

361
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,072
I like my head this size.       

362
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,074
  Just keep him away from me.   

363
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:56,743
                He's the only   
                shrink we know. 

364
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:59,579
Oh, stop, Sam.                  
You're embarrassing me.         

365
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,347
What's the problem?             

366
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,767
            Well, Carla wants   
            to visit Eddie      
            on the West Coast,  

367
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,434
                but she's       
                afraid to fly.  

368
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,037
Well, do you mean,              
by afraid to fly, what?         

369
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:11,741
Um... she's claustrophobic,     
agoraphobic, or acrophobic?     

370
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,693
        Death-o-phobic.         

371
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,027
Well, you know, Carla,          

372
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,529
I've done a lot                 
of reading lately               

373
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,030
about fear of flying.           

374
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,099
I've always wanted              
to conduct a workshop           

375
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,934
 for people with your problem.  

376
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:25,305
I'm sure I could <i>scare up</i>       
     <i>a few people like you.</i>     

377
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,506
Oh, no pun intended.            

378
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,260
    None noticed, I am sure.    

379
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:31,694
                No way, Frasier.

380
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,696
        I am not going to       
        wind up in your office, 

381
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,031
        strapped to some table  

382
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:37,033
        with electricity shot   
        through my head.        

383
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,468
    Carla, that's not           
      part of the therapy.      

384
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,470
Oh, yeah? What about Diane?     

385
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,523
            Now, look. I never  
            treated Diane       

386
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:46,125
            with any kind       
            of shock inducement.

387
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,261
Of course,                      
now I wish I had.               

388
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:54,050
                No, no. The key 
                to this therapy,

389
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:57,020
            you see, is, uh...  
            desensitization.    

390
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:58,254
                Over a period   
                of sessions,    

391
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,722
                we slowly break 
                down your fears 

392
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,357
            until you're ready  
            to get on a plane.  

393
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:03,894
            And, at the end,    
            we all take         
            an actual flight.   

394
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,695
Yeah? Well,                     
fly this, Orville.              

395
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,664
    ( <i>phone ringing</i> )           

396
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,665
            Cheers.             

397
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,766
             EDDIE:             
        Hey, Sam.               

398
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:11,968
        Oh, hey, Eddie.         

399
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:13,152
Long time                       
no hear. Yeah.                  

400
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:13,987
    How you doing?              

401
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,205
    Oh, the show? It's okay.    

402
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:17,040
        It's kind               
 of a hockey players' reunion.  

403
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:18,708
            Listen.             
Did you talk to her, Sam?       

404
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,043
I mean, what did she say?       

405
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:21,878
No, listen. The problem, Eddie, 

406
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,847
          is not that           
    she's afraid to see you.    

407
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,681
 It's that she's afraid to fly. 

408
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,016
                Carla, afraid?  

409
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,118
            Carla's not afraid  
            of anything, Sam.   

410
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:30,653
                See, that's     
                just an excuse. 

411
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,288
                I mean, she's   
                ashamed of me.  

412
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,422
                    You know    
                    something?  

413
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:34,757
                    It's just   
                    not working.

414
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,025
            I'm going to quit.  

415
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,093
No, wait.                       
Hold on. Hold on.               

416
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:39,095
Listen, he's so sure            
you're ashamed of him           

417
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,113
that he wants to quit.          

418
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,198
                    Really?     
    Yes.                        

419
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,166
            Give me this phone. 

420
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,652
             Eddie?             

421
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,490
     I'm coming to see you.     

422
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,393
 I'll be there in about a week. 

423
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:54,494
                Really?         
                Aw, gee, Carla. 

424
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,229
        I got the biggest smile 
        you ever saw on my face.

425
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,964
    I wish you could see me.    

426
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,285
                        Eddie?  

427
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,578
Before we take off,             
I'd like to commend you.        

428
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,429
                It's been an    
                intense week,   

429
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:16,215
but here we are, finally,       
at the end of our journey.      

430
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,420
    Or should I say, perhaps    
    the beginning of the end    

431
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:23,088
of our journey.                 

432
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:24,941
I guess                         
we're all set.                  

433
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,826
Let's get this show on the road.

434
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,028
Dr. Crane, uh...                
I... I hope you don't mind.     

435
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,764
I brought along a little        
Saint Christopher's medal.      

436
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,466
         Oh. Well, no.          
If that helps you, that's fine. 

437
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,834
        Oh, great.              

438
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:37,603
     Anybody else want one?     

439
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:38,904
        Now, now, Carla.        

440
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:41,207
    All religious artifacts     
         must be stored         

441
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,476
     either below the seat      
        in front of you         

442
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,144
    or in the overhead bin.     

443
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:47,279
There, now.                     
Isn't this fun? Huh?            

444
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:48,481
                        Now...  

445
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,416
    we're going to take off     
    in a few minutes,           

446
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,218
so what should we all be doing? 

447
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:53,819
            People?             

448
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:58,908
  Well, we should be focusing   
      on our happy place.       

449
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,595
                That place where

450
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,448
     we most like to be...      
where we're most relaxed.       

451
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,317
Can you see it?                 

452
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,985
                Excuse me, sir. 
                We'll be taking 
                off shortly.    

453
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,320
                Would you       
                please sit down?

454
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:11,887
Oh, yes, of course.             
Just a moment.                  

455
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:14,157
        All right, now,         
  you're in your happy place.   

456
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,274
                            Hmm?

457
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,476
You're at peace with the world. 

458
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,227
      ( <i>engines roaring</i> )       

459
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,779
    Oh, God.                    

460
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:21,581
            Now, just stay      
            in your happy place.

461
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:23,699
If it's the beach,              

462
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,784
                just imagine    
                that that sound 

463
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,271
        is the gentle rippling  
        of the water.           

464
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:29,972
                Carla,          

465
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,990
where's your                    
happy place?                    

466
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:32,359
  On the floor of my stomach,   

467
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,193
      clutching the earth       
        with both hands.        

468
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:35,945
          Good. Good!           

469
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,514
     Oh! Uh... Dr. Crane...     

470
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:42,218
         I've forgotten         
    where my happy place is.    

471
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:44,370
I think yours                   
was in the Berkshires.          
                Oh, yes.        

472
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:45,739
                Mine is in      
                the Berkshires. 

473
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,506
Look, everybody can be          
in the Berkshires if they like. 

474
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,712
The Berkshires is an expansive  
and wonderful wooded wonderland.

475
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:56,182
        That's going to go up   
        like a Roman candle     

476
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,051
                when this baby  
                crashes into it!

477
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,320
              MAN:              
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
we've been cleared for takeoff. 

478
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:02,821
  So please, sit back, relax.   

479
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:05,141
Thanks for flying with us.      

480
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:08,477
            Did he say, "Thanks 
            for dying with us"? 

481
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:09,979
    Just relax.                 

482
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:12,181
I'll be sitting                 
right here beside you.          

483
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:15,451
If you're a little nervous,     
go ahead and grab on to me.     

484
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,850
Afternoon, everybody.           

485
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,685
            MEN:                
            Norm! Norm! Norm!   

486
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,287
What's the story, Mr. Peterson? 

487
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,405
         "Bobbsey Twins         
      Go to the Brewery."       

488
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,841
            Let's just cut      
            to the happy ending.

489
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,476
                    Uh-oh!      

490
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,662
We got the Cheers review today.

 Well, at least you'll all know

            I didn't

        got a horrendous review

00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:51,855

611
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:54,564
Frasier's class taught me       
    how stupid it was           

612
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:56,732
    to be afraid of flying.     

613
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:59,034
          Oh, me, too.          

614
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:00,970
 I can't wait to get you alone, 

615
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:06,008
 strip you out of that penguin  
 outfit, and climb all over ya. 

616
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:10,179
      We're sharing a room      
  with the three little pigs?   

617
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:14,683
    Well, they're used          
    to huffing and puffing.     

618
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:17,386
    All right. See you then.    

619
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:18,838
Sam, you don't                  
really think Miss Howe          

620
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:21,674
would do anything she           
shouldn't have to get           
a good review, do you?          

621
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,109
            No, Of course not.  
Then why do you                 
keep teasing her?               

622
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:25,878
                Well, haven't   
                you ever noticed

623
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:28,881
            how her chest       
            kind of heaves      
            when she's angry?   

624
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,800
I always avert my eyes.         

625
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,721
            You're kidding me.  
    No.                         

626
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,474
    I'm a leg man.              

627
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,212
                Excuse me, miss?

628
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:46,148
            I couldn't help     
            but overhear        
            your conversation.  

629
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:48,418
            I've had a fear     
            of flying for years,

630
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:51,137
        and I think it's time   
        that I confronted it.   

631
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:52,789
                How can I get   
                into that class 

632
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,524
            that worked         
            miracles for you?   

633
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,858
I can do                        
better than that.               

634
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,361
The doctor's over               
there. Hey, Fras?               

635
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,746
     I'm in my happy place.     

636
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,800
                Sign up early.  

637
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,141
