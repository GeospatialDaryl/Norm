1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,678
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,915
Buon giorno, Norm.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,474
Cliffie.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,432
Yeah.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,036
- Kind of bright out there today, huh?
- Yeah, I wouldn't know.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,793
Yeah.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,958
I feel sorry for all those
people that have to squint.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,350
Say, Cliff, those wouldn't be
new glasses, would they?

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,590
Oh, hey, you noticed, huh?

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,309
Yeah, ltalian imports.
Sixty-five smack-a-roonies.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
That's right. Notice the sleek,
European styling there,

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,191
the sturdy reinforced frames,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,590
and the hi-tech, shatterproof
reflective lenses

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,273
that allow me to scope out the dollies

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,671
without drawing attention to myself.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,755
You could walk up to them naked
with your hair on fire

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,593
and not draw attention to yourself.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,230
Yeah? What would you know?
They only work on women.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,629
You!

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,236
They seem to have given you courage.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,557
- Prove it.
- Well, what do you mean?

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,234
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing
a little demonstration myself.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,271
- So...
- All right, all right.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,032
All right. All right!

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,237
You've got the shades.
What are you worrying about?

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,752
Excuse me.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,388
Oh, perfect!

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,197
Thanks.

29
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,872
Well, I don't care what anybody says,
we had better chatter out there.

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,150
Shut up, Cliff.

31
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,479
Sounds suspiciously as if
there is no joy in Mudville.

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,677
Who gives a damn? We lost.

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,395
We didn't lose.
We got dumped on.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,120
We were dragged by our noses
through the dung heap.

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,430
They ripped out our guts,
held them up for us to see,

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,114
and then they rammed them
down our throats.

37
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,153
It's a grand old game.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,719
Damn!

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,996
Now I know why they weren't afraid
to let me play.

40
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,229
They were great out there.

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,550
They were like the '27 Yankees.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,718
He's exaggerating.
There were only nine of them.

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,317
Come on, guys. We can't just
sit around crying in our beer here.

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,953
- Norman's right.
- We don't have any.

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,918
Come on, Diane, step on it, will you.
I feel a tear welling up here.

46
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,633
What the hell?
First round on the house.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,677
Hey, Sammy!

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,997
Yeah, well, if you think I'm drinking
with you guys, you're nuts!

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,755
I'd rather drink with those snail pellets
from Gary's Old Towne Tavern.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,150
- At least they're winners.
- That really hurts, Carla.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,470
Hey, really, I don't think we played
so bad, you know.

52
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,677
- Listen to Mr Gold Glove over here.
- Come on!

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,876
Yeah? You drew more flies
than bad liver.

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,359
Oh, give me a break!

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,351
The only thing more amazing than that
was you dropped every one of them.

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,877
Come on, will you. I just have a little
problem with balls hit directly at me.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,639
The...

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,392
I think it's probably
the sun, you know,

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,358
or that I can't bend over.

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,599
Poor Norman.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,830
Well, at least some of us
looked good out there, huh?

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,073
Yeah, Cliff, the less of your
face showing, the better.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,392
Oh, listen to yourselves.

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,951
You're letting a minor setback
in some trivial competition

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,634
ruin what is an otherwise lovely day.

66
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,879
Forget it, Sam.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,673
You just don't get it, do you?

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,834
It's not just that the guys from Gary's
beat us at basketball, volleyball, darts

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,468
and every other sport
known to mankind.

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,471
It's more than that.

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,993
I'm a jock.

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,594
This is a jock bar,
but if we keep losing,

73
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,320
all the jocks are gonna say,
"Hey, Cheers is for losers.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,072
Let's go drink over at Gary's."

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,633
Oh, they'll never say that.

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,677
They'll say, "Me no like Cheers.

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,308
Let's go to Gary's."

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,878
Gentlemen of Cheers. And ladies.

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,598
- Tough game out there today.
- What are you doing here?

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,193
Boy, you guys have the worst luck.

81
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,120
Yeah, it looks like it just
followed us home, huh?

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,788
Listen, we were over having
a celebration at my little tavern

83
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,554
and I kept thinking,
"Something's missing."

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,280
It wasn't as happy as it usually is
when we beat you.

85
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,635
And then I realized what it was.

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,598
I didn't get a chance to thank you
guys for the game.

87
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,638
So I came over here to do it now.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,956
Way to go.

89
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,869
The pop-up king.

90
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,717
Many thanks.

91
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,279
Great glasses.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,271
This is what I was afraid of.

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,590
Hard feelings.

94
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,395
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,989
You guys have nothing
to hang your heads about.

96
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,432
You played hard. You played clean.
You gave it your all.

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,349
Just remember, it takes two sides
to make a victory.

98
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,195
One side to win and you guys.

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,037
Excuse me, but you've obviously
come here to belittle my friends.

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,519
Why? I can only speculate.

101
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,468
Perhaps you're compensating for some
physical shortcoming. I don't know.

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,272
But it's tragic that you place
such stock in a silly competition.

103
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,113
What of higher attainments?
What of loftier pursuits?

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,636
What of art? And philosophy?
What of music?

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,516
I graduated magna cum laude
in American Literature from Princeton.

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,757
Oh? Couldn't make summa?

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,559
Hey, look, Gar. You only came here
to rub our noses in it.

108
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,472
You've done a great job.
Mission accomplished.

109
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,675
Now why don't you take off.

110
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,438
- Yeah, take a hike.
- Sam,

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,359
I came here in the
spirit of sportsmanship.

112
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,478
I'll show you sportsmanship.

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,794
People! People!

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,237
This is neither the time nor the place
for such childish behaviour.

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,278
Yeah, let's save it
for when we kick his butt.

116
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,711
In what? We're kind of running out
of sports, aren't we?

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,470
Well, it's really been
a truly enjoyable afternoon.

118
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,073
Gentlemen, ladies.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,355
- See you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

120
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,909
Listen, I'll have you know
that I'm putting together a team

121
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,595
right this moment, that's gonna have
you shaking in those shoes of yours.

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,075
Hey, those are nice.

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,512
Well, thanks. And is that a challenge?

124
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,597
- Yeah.
- In what sport?

125
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,671
I'll tell you in what sport.

126
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,114
In...

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,111
- Bowling.
- Yeah, bowling.

128
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,232
Great! I've knocked down
a pin or two in my day.

129
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,470
- When and where?
- Well, I'll just let you know.

130
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,232
- Okay?
- Okay.

131
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,469
Okay.

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,755
- Okay.
- Okay!

133
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,273
- Okay!
- Okay!

134
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,795
- Okay!
- Okay!

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,595
Bowling?

136
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,028
Don't worry.

137
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,315
I got this theory, Sam.

138
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,917
You see, all of those other sports
required real athletic ability,

139
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,918
but with bowling, we got the makings
of a great team!

140
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,798
- Oh, Carla, l...
- Oh, listen, listen!

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,235
You go to any bowling alley,
what do you see?

142
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,516
A bunch of out-of-shape
couch potatoes

143
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,638
who do nothing but sit around
and swill beer.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,717
All right, we're number one!

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,594
Back so soon from the sport
of the great unwashed?

146
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,912
How was the audition?

147
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,069
Tryout.

148
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,312
Diane, in sports, it's called a tryout.

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,994
- We got a team.
- Yeah, of what, I'd like to know.

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,794
I'm gonna call Gary and call it off.

151
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,469
I'm telling you, when one lousy bar
can't produce four decent bowlers,

152
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,031
it's time for America to take
a long, hard look at itself.

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,078
Hey, you!

154
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,551
You don't know anything
about bowling, do you?

155
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,874
Hey, Woodhead...

156
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,510
...I asked you if you know
how to bowl.

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,589
You have bowled, haven't you?

158
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,113
- Yes.
- When?

159
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,191
- When?
- Before.

160
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,636
- Before what?
- Before I came to Cheers.

161
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,030
You're good, aren't you?

162
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,154
I won a couple trophies.

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,352
Sammy. Sam, Sam, don't--
Don't call it off!

164
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,112
What? What? Hold on a second.

165
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,952
- We got a ringer.
- Got a what?

166
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,634
We got a ringer. Woody.
Woody is a bowling machine.

167
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,990
Trust me. He's got a room
full of trophies.

168
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,798
Hey, Gar.

169
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,916
No, we're not wimping out.

170
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,433
Yeah, tomorrow.

171
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,592
Vic's Bowl-A-Rama. We rumble.

172
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,269
Okay!

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,112
Okay!

174
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,435
- All right, Woody!
- Woody!

175
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,591
Please don't ask me to bowl. I can't.

176
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,349
Why not?

177
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,033
The tragedy.

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,953
- Well, what tragedy?
- What tragedy?

179
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,869
Once I maimed a man
in a bowling accident.

180
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,556
I'll never bowl again as long as I live.

181
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,996
Great idea, Sam. Bowling.

182
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,274
Okay, it's time to go.

183
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,312
Let's see if we can, you know,

184
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,473
maybe somehow manage
not to embarrass ourselves.

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,075
Ladies and gentlemen, Knute Rockne.

186
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,191
Come on, let's go. I wanna warm up.

187
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,274
Hold on a second, guys.

188
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,557
Say, Woody, it's still not too late
to change your mind.

189
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,990
Don't you understand?
I maimed a man.

190
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,917
Bowling accidents happen. You read
about them in the paper all the time.

191
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,715
He was only an innocent
maintenance man.

192
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,388
Come on, man. He knew the risks.

193
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,919
I still don't know what happened.

194
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,311
One minute, I was picking up
the eight-ten split,

195
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,710
and the next thing I know,
the ten pin flies

196
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,677
and hits old Sully
right between the eyes

197
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,832
and he goes down
like a sack of wheat.

198
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,475
Sam, I ruined the man's life.

199
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,874
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

200
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,359
Oh, no. No, I'm not.

201
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,597
Old Sully got too dim-witted
to stay in bowling maintenance.

202
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,038
Last I heard, he was a clown
at children's birthday parties.

203
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,509
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- He wasn't invited to them.

204
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,836
Come on, Woody.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,958
Listen, man, I've never begged
for anything in my life

206
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,437
that I actually enjoyed once I got it.

207
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,789
Come on.

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,713
Please. Come on,
join the team here.

209
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,638
We need you, Woody. Come on.

210
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,549
I can't! Since the accident, I haven't
been able to set foot in a bowling alley.

211
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,558
Well, why don't you just try it today.

212
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,153
Maybe the memory's faded.

213
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,672
- You don't understand what's at stake.
- Can't you hear me? No!

214
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,637
Sammy, I'll take a crack at him here.

215
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,749
Listen to me, all right?

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,879
Now, every once in a while you just
gotta look beyond yourself, okay?

217
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,270
And think about the team.

218
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,670
Like my old high school football coach
used to always say:

219
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,559
"Give the ball to Peterson.
He'll know what to do with it."

220
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,597
Well, hey, I didn't want
that responsibility,

221
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,672
but for the good of the team,
you understand,

222
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,193
I took it.

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,555
We went ahead
and we had a great season.

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,393
- Were you the fullback?
- No, I was the equipment manager.

225
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,516
- But that's not my point.
- Oh, come on, Norm.

226
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,432
You're wasting your breath.
He ain't bowling.

227
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,352
All right, think about that, Woody.

228
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,838
Go team!

229
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
Yeah! Not too shabby.

230
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,558
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!

231
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,389
Old Towne Tavern!

232
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,397
- Old Towne Tavern!
- Quiet, you guys.

233
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,279
Let's show our worthy opponent
a little courtesy.

234
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,558
Back off, buster, or I'll put Vaseline
in your finger holes.

235
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,518
Just try to touch my ball.

236
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,870
I'm talking about your nose.

237
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,710
- Choke on it!
- Choke on it!

238
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,196
You got the cheering under control.
I'll mosey up to the bar for a beer.

239
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,272
- You're gonna miss the game, Norm.
- Then that's a perfect plan, huh?

240
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,716
Hey, Cliffie, how're we doing here?

241
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,995
Fifty pins down,
sinking like a stone, Sammy.

242
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,119
Norm!

243
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,073
How the hell they know him here?

244
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,668
He's got a life, you know.

245
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,952
That's all right, man. It's okay.
It's okay.

246
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,349
Hey, Tawny,

247
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,557
has anyone ever told you you make
even bowling shoes look sexy?

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,753
Don't you ever stop?
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

249
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,793
No, I'm just trying to distract her here
so she won't know what to do.

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,070
A little wink, a sexy nod,

251
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,755
and a glimpse of these
taut athletic buns.

252
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,717
Oh, wait a second here, Tawny.

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,035
Oh, what's this?

254
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,155
I think your butt needs a tune-up.

255
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,590
- Sam.
- Hey, what're you doing here?

256
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,988
I'm here as a driver only,

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,390
but I brought someone with me
who'd like to bowl.

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
- Woody!
- Woody!

259
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,508
Hey, time out, Gary.

260
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,511
- Who's taking care of the bar here?
- Oh, don't worry. We closed it.

261
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,638
We would have been here sooner, but
it took a while to get those people out.

262
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,831
Oh, well, great. Yeah.

263
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,275
All right, go get some shoes on here.

264
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,311
Woody!

265
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,874
- What made him change his mind?
- I don't know.

266
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,640
He was right in the middle
of doing something and he said,

267
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,358
"l can't let the guys down. Let's go."

268
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,709
Hey, Woody!

269
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,996
How are we gonna do this?
We've already started here.

270
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,952
Cliff, what about your wrist injury?

271
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,748
- What injury?
- Don't make me hurt you.

272
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,115
Easy, easy.

273
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,794
Gary, we're gonna need
an injury substitution here.

274
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,473
Hey, you got it.

275
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,676
The one thing I've never been
called is unfair.

276
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,195
I can believe that's the one thing
you've never been called.

277
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,716
All right, I'm gonna go
fire Woody up here.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,434
The alleys. Thanks.

279
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,876
It's really a sensory experience,
you know.

280
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,958
The scent of Aqua Net
on a beehive hairdo.

281
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,759
The roar of polyester
against old Naugahyde.

282
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,514
The sight of a cigarette stubbed out
in a patty melt.

283
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,998
All this, plus the anticipation
of placing your feet in shoes

284
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,879
only 7,000 others
have worn before you.

285
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,279
Woody! Yeah!

286
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,152
All right! Let's go!

287
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,713
Listen, if this is gonna be
tough on you,

288
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,791
I want you to know that you
don't have to do this.

289
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,552
No, I want to, Sam.

290
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,789
You're absolutely sure?

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,877
Oh, I'm sure.

292
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,553
You all have been like family to me.

293
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,639
I love you guys.

294
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,398
Okay, all right, Woody.

295
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,719
- Watch this, Gar.
- Yeah.

296
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,951
If you're having second thoughts,
that's okay, pal.

297
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,479
No, no, I want to do this.

298
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,314
- Okay, I'm ready.
- All right. All right.

299
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,232
- Woody?
- I wanna do this, Sam.

300
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,389
Remember, I love you guys.

301
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,074
I'm ready, Sam.

302
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,559
It's okay, Woody.

303
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,233
I'm gonna bowl.

304
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,914
I don't know what I was worried about.
This is easy.

305
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,789
Those guys are dead meat.
You know what I'm saying, Sam?

306
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,513
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

307
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,710
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!

308
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,869
Old Towne Tavern!

309
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,076
Old Towne Tavern!

310
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,873
- Hey, nice game, Sam.
- Oh, get out of here.

311
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,315
We said two out of three,
and we're taking you to the wall.

312
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,833
That's right!

313
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,635
All right, all of you in favour of saving
what shred of dignity we have left

314
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,439
and sneaking out of here,
raise your hands.

315
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,750
That's one...

316
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,794
Hey, how come you voted?
You're not even playing.

317
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,159
I thought we were ordering pizza.

318
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,434
Sam, we can't quit.

319
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,310
Listen, Sam, maybe we can
sweeten the pot a little.

320
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,233
- Get out of here, will you.
- No, no, no.

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,630
If you guys win,

322
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,869
I'll set you up with Tawny.

323
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,956
Maybe we can talk.

324
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,799
And if we win,

325
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,751
you set me up with the
Sweetheart of Sigma Chi.

326
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,231
Excuse me.

327
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,911
I didn't date Sigma Chis.

328
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,479
I was Phi Epsilon Delta.

329
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,352
You girls had quite a reputation.

330
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,674
Yes, for academic achievement.

331
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,031
Is that what it was?

332
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,715
Tell me, isn't it true that Phi Epsilon
is Greek for "Hi, sailor"?

333
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,913
Give me your shoes.

334
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,513
Give me your shoes.

335
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,712
- Oh, Diane, are you bowling?
- Yes.

336
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,917
- Come on. Well, are you any good?
- Yes.

337
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,157
And if you whisper a word of this
to anyone who matters,

338
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,117
I'll find you and I'll kill you.

339
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,355
Did you think I came by my utter
contempt for the sport by accident?

340
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,794
Hardly.

341
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,075
I took it in college.

342
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,075
- You bowled in college?
- Yes.

343
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,593
I needed the PE credits.

344
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,633
I could read between frames,
and you didn't have to run.

345
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,588
I spent six semesters sweating
in a tawdry bowling alley.

346
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,557
Bowlers don't sweat.

347
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,917
They do when they're wearing tweed.

348
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,316
In spite of my complete disdain
for the experience,

349
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,155
I have no intention of letting this
lvy League lounge lizard

350
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,710
insult me and my sorority sisters

351
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,198
and send Cheers
to ignominious defeat.

352
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,669
Your mama!

353
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,519
Chambers! Chambers!

354
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,353
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

355
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,832
- Chambers! Chambers!
- Thank you! Thank you!

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,479
Now put me down!

357
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,074
I'm afraid of heights,
and someone has very cold hands.

358
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,111
Okay, everybody, line up.
I'm pouring beers.

359
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,671
I gotta hand it to you, Whitey.

360
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,955
For once, you did something

361
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,270
that didn't make me wanna
shove a rat in your mouth

362
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,475
and sew your lips shut.

363
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,469
Such praise. I blush.

364
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,831
- Congratulations, Sam.
- Yeah. Thank you.

365
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,949
Oh, excuse me. Continue celebrating.
Huzzah, huzzah.

366
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,236
- It was a great win, wasn't it, Sam?
- Yeah, it was.

367
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,868
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

368
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,999
I've been amply rewarded just seeing
how well you're taking this.

369
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,550
The old Sam Malone would have died

370
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,474
before letting a woman
salvage his athletic pride.

371
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,832
- You've grown.
- You know something?

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,276
I think I have. Oh, by the way.

373
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,911
Tawny wasn't the only one looking
sexy out there in bowling shoes.

374
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,148
Well, thank you.

375
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,635
No, oh, no, no. I was talking about me.

376
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,716
You know, I'm surprised
you didn't mention something.

377
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,836
No, seriously, seriously.

378
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,879
Great form out there.

379
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,230
- Thank you.
- No, no, I was still talking about me.

380
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,951
All right, all jokes aside here,
thank you very much

381
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,315
for helping me beat Gary.

382
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,392
Well,

383
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,439
I was getting tired of listening
to some ignorant blowhard

384
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,275
take himself and some stupid
competition so seriously.

385
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,078
Boy, he really does that, doesn't he?

386
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,356
No, I was talking about you.
