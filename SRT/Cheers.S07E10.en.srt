Oh, hi, Dr. Sternin.

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,400
Dr. Crane isn't here.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,400
I know. He's at home,      
    and that's why I'm not.

CARLA:  
                        Whoa-ho!

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,900
Not really.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Scotch, Woody.

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm just not looking            
forward to going home.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,200
Frasier's giving me

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,500
every indication        
    that he expects me

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,700
to indulge in another one of his
silly little fantasies tonight,

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,900
but it's really rather personal.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,000
I know just                     
what you mean.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,500
Husbands can drive you nuts     
about stuff like that.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Take my Eddie.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He borrowed this                
fairy princess costume

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
from the ice show.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,100
Really.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Every Friday night,             
I have to dress up

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,900
and put a magic                 
sex spell on him.

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,100
Well, as long       
            as we're sharing,

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,300
here's what I have  
            waiting for me.

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,500
Every so often, 
                Frasier likes

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,600
to regress          
            to his childhood.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,400
First, he insists   
            on calling me Mommy.

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,900
I fix him cinnamon toast
        and strawberry milk.

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,100
Then it's bath time--   
        one of my favorites--

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,800
followed by my      
            tucking him into bed

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,100
and singing "All the    
        Pretty Little Horses."

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,800
After that,         
            we make love until  
            the windows rattle.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,500
Men! They're really             
something, aren't they?

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,600
Oh, by the way, about all       
that fairy princess stuff?

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
I was just kidding.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
So was I.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,600
Oh, right, Mommy.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Hey, guys, get  
                a load of this!

Hey, Mr. Peterson. There's    
  a cold one waiting for you.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,300
I know. And, if she calls,      
         I'm not here.

            Not again.

            all day yesterday.

I got Rebecca out there.

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,800
I got Carla out there.

do everything       
            better than we do.

They're 100% cotton.

                me seriously.

            to hurt this guy    
            where he lives.

Speaking of that,               
have you seen his house?

 with a new T-shirt of it, too.

Well, what took you so long?

are we supposed to do now?

Usually, I pack             
    my face in ice.

131

Sam, guess what         
    I've got under my coat.

        you grabbed it and ran.

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
and have it analyzed

149
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,700
to find out           
Gary's secret ingredient.

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,700
CLIFF:                          
No, no. No need                 
to do that, Rebecca.

151
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Sammy, pour me a shot      
      of that concoction.

152
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll tell you          
     exactly what's in it.

153
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,300
Oh, man, I don't know.

154
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,000
No, no, no. I've got very   
    sensitive taste buds.

155
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,600
As a matter of fact,
            in medieval times,

156
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,900
Clavins were                    
the royal tasters.

157
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,100
I heard they                    
were royal something.

158
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Well, I don't know              
what's in it,

159
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
but Gary makes the              
best Bloody Mary                
I've ever tasted.

160
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,000
NORM:               
            All right, Sammy,

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,100
set me up with      
            a shot of that, huh?

162
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Let me have                     
some of that.

163
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Hey, hey, you guys,             
don't drink it all.

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,900
I have to take                  
some to the lab.

165
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
This is great.

166
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,800
Gary deserves to win            
this contest every year.

167
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,300
It's almost worth cramming      
    myself into this dress.

168
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,700
Hey, I'd dress up   
            as a hooker

169
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,100
to get some     
                of <i>this</i> stuff.

170
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, come on, you guys.

171
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,200
It can't be that special.

172
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
I suppose you're going     
        to tell me

173
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,700
that Cheers has never made      
    a Bloody Mary this good.

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,200
Sammy, Cheers never             
made anything this good.

175
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
I wonder what's in it.

176
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,900
( <i>sneezes</i> )

177
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,200
( <i>jar breaks</i> )

178
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Well, we know          
 there's black cardamom in it.

179
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
Damn it, Woody!

180
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,400
Ah! Cheers...

181
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,700
where good times go to die.

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
CLIFF:              
            Well, well, well!

183
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,400
If it isn't Gary from       
    Gary's Olde Towne Tavern.

184
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Look, pal,                      
didn't I tell you

185
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
if you step one                 
more foot in here

186
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,600
you'd have me                   
to answer to?

187
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Yeah, and I told you      
      if you got in my way

188
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,000
you'd wind up          
     in the next zip code.

189
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,500
Then we have had                
this discussion, huh?

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Now, I brought a little present 
    to my friends at Cheers.

191
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh, yeah?                       
What's that, Gary?

192
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,000
Towels for you to cry into

193
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,600
after I win           
    the Bloody Mary contest.

194
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
You know what I'd like     
     to do with that towel?

195
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,400
I'd like to shove   
            that up your nose,

196
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,200
pull it out your mouth  
        a couple times,

197
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
and buff up your
                sinuses for you.

198
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,500
Oh, as if you could.

199
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,800
Oh, I could.

200
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,400
You could not.

201
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Could too.

202
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Could not.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,700
Could too.

204
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Could not!

205
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
Could too!

206
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,400
Way to go,  
                    Sammy!

207
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,300
See me slip that                
"could too" in there?

208
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Well, you won that one, Malone.

209
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,300
But that's

210
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
the last thing         
      you're going to win.

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,300
Hey, big shot,         
      we won this contest

212
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,800
the first two years they had it.

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
Well, since I opened,      
    I've won the last four.

214
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,400
All that proves is  
            that you've won it

215
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,300
twice as much   
                as we have.

216
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,400
How did you     
                like that, Sam?

217
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,900
Let me handle this, Woody.

218
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Just get going.         
  Get out of here, would you?

219
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,400
Is this                         
the thanks I get

220
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
for my                          
heartfelt gift?

221
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,700
No.

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,300
This is.

223
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, that's nice.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
I see you're still hiring       
the cool Grace Kelly type

225
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,800
for waitresses.

226
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,600
Choke on it!

227
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Okay, okay, I'm going back      
to the Olde Towne Tavern,

228
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,300
where

229
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,100
my exclusive satellite coverage

230
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
of the World Welterweight       
          title fight

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
is about to get underway.

232
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,800
Hey.

233
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, wait. Hey, come on.

234
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Where the hell         
do you think you're going?

235
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,800
Uh... just taking   
            a little stroll.

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Ah! That was refreshing,
        wasn't it?

237
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Hey, Doc.       
                What's going on?

238
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,400
Well, for one thing, I find   
    myself baching it again.

239
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,300
Lilith finally      
            blow her brains out?

240
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,300
No. But thank you               
for asking after her, Carla.

241
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
So where is                     
the lovely Dr. Sternin?

242
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,300
Well, she's in Albany           
for a few days

243
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,700
attending a conference          
on gender stereotyping.

244
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,600
Gender stereotyping?

245
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,600
Yes. It's unfairly attributing  
certain modes of behavior

246
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
exclusively to one sex.

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
That sounds     
                kind of boring.

248
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Why did she 
                    go to that?

249
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Who knows?

250
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,100
You know women.

251
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
I can't tell you    
            how honored we are

252
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
that you've     
                chosen our bar

253
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,600
as the site of the  
            Bloody Mary contest.

254
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,300
Well, we were                   
going to hold it

255
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,900
at Gary's                       
Olde Towne Tavern,

256
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
but they're just so             
darn crowded in there.

257
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,700
Well, you know,

258
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
you'll never have   
            that problem here.

259
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,800
Well, I better be going.

260
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,100
I have to drop off              
a set of rules                  
at Gary's Tavern.

261
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,700
So long.

262
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Bye.

263
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,400
What the hey?          
     That's Gary on the TV.

264
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,900
GARY:              
We hid a secret camera in       
 a competitor's establishment.

265
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,700
Let's hear what they have to say
about Gary's Bloody Marys.

266
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Boy, I don't know           
        what's in that,

267
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,700
but Gary makes the best     
 Bloody Mary I've ever tasted.

268
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,300
GARY:              
            Really?

269
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
Gary deserves to win            
this contest every year.

270
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,400
Thank you very much.

271
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,800
And you'd be surprised

272
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,300
what some people would do

273
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,400
to get a hold          
     of my Bloody Mary mix.

274
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,900
Hey, I'd dress up   
            like a hooker to get
            some of this stuff.

275
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,500
GARY:              
        But you can get         
a pretty good Bloody Mary

276
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,900
just about anywhere in town.  
    Isn't that right?

277
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,600
Cheers never made           
    a Bloody Mary this good.

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
If you say so,         
     Sam Malone of Cheers.

279
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Anybody know                    
the way to Gary's?

280
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
I'll give you a lift.

281
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,400
I can't believe         
     that weasel filmed us!

282
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,900
Oh, that stunt tears it.    
          Now I'm mad.

283
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,300
Yeah, I can tell.   
    How?

284
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,700
That little vein                
bulging in my forehead?

285
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,700
No.

286
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,300
My nostrils flaring?

287
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
No.

288
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,400
My jaw is clenched?

289
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,800
No.

290
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,100
Well, then,                     
how can you tell?

291
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
You just said,  
                "Now I'm mad."

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
Yeah, well, now I'm really mad.

293
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,300
Yeah, I can tell.   
    How?

294
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,400
I'll tell you something.    
This is war. This is total war.

295
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,800
No prisoners, no truce,     
    no amnesty, no nothing.

296
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,400
Only one of us is going     
 to walk out of there standing.

297
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,800
Well, what are you              
going to do, Sam?

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, for one,         
     to really mess him up,

299
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,500
we're going to have       
     to infiltrate his bar.

300
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,400
CARLA:  
                        Yeah.   
Oh, let me do it, Sam.

301
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
Please. Let me do it.

302
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,800
You know, I've taken            
a lot of makeup classes.

303
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
I can... I can                  
put on a disguise

304
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,300
and get in there without        
anyone knowing about it.

305
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,700
Woody, I don't think so.

306
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Oh, come on.                    
Let me do it.

307
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,700
I feel responsible.

308
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm the one who                 
blew away the spice.

309
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm the one                     
who broke the jar.

310
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm the one who broke           
the door in the men's room.

311
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
What?

312
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
At the bus station              
downtown.

313
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,500
Come on. Let me                 
make it up to you.

314
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,700
Woody, you just...          
    you don't know

315
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,900
what you're getting         
    yourself into.

316
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,100
I mean, those guys      
        at Gary's are vicious.

317
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,500
They could      
                strip you naked,

318
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
paint you red and   
            put you on a subway.

319
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,700
They wouldn't do that.

320
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,000
They did it to me.

321
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
But I got       
                the best of 'em.

322
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,700
How's that?

323
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,300
I loved it.

324
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,000
Wait a minute, Woody,      
     come here, come here.

325
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,500
Woody, Woody, Woody,

326
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
I've got a plan.        
        Listen up.

327
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,200
Shh!

328
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,500
Gary had a camera in here       
         the other day.

329
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,000
He could have a spy
             in here now.

330
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
And the whole place
             could be bugged.

331
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
Come on, you guys.

332
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,300
Whoa, whoa.

333
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Don't take off in a clump       
        like that.

334
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
It'll look suspicious.

335
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,300
Everybody split up.

336
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
We'll hook up outside.

337
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,800
No, no, no!

338
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
You're clumping up again.

339
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,500
Spread out.

340
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,900
No, you're clumping up again.

341
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Cliffie, you got
                the time, pal?

342
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Right, time check.

343
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
2200 Zulu.

344
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,400
Agent Hoosier is overdue.

345
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
Abort Operation Red Dawn.

346
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,700
Cliff...

347
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,500
What in God's name    
          are you talking about?

348
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Spy lingo, Norm.

349
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
Woody's not back
                from Gary's yet.

350
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,600
It's time to mobilize   
        our forces. Let's go.

351
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,900
I'm just the man for it.

352
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,400
Actually, I considered a career 
as a spy when I was young,

353
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,100
but in the end, I decided       
  not to go into intelligence.

354
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,600
That seems only fair.

355
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
None of it went into you.

356
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,700
Hey, guys, guys, guys.     
What's the big rush here?

357
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Give him a chance.

358
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,300
He's only about         
    five minutes late.

359
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,600
Actually, I think we might be  
     underestimating Woody.

360
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
You know, something tells me

361
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,700
he might actually           
      pull this thing off.

362
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Hey! Hey!

363
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,900
Wait, there's a note.

364
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
What's it say?

365
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
( <i>moaning</i> )

366
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
"Compliments of Gary's.         
We deliver."

367
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,900
( <i>muffled speaking</i> )

368
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,900
What?

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,800
What are you  
                  trying to say?

370
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
He's trying to say              
something.

371
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,900
What are you...?
    Don't rip off the tape!

372
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
( <i>screams</i> ):                    
Ahh!

373
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,900
That's it, Cornmeal.            
You blew it.

374
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm telling you,            
    I was doing fine.

375
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,100
I borrowed this great costume   
from my theater group.

376
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,000
I really looked                 
like a nun.

377
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,600
I went in there...

378
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

379
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,400
You dressed up as a nun
         and went into a bar?

380
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Well,                           
it was either that

381
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,300
or one of                       
the von Trapp children.

382
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,700
This is the stupidest thing
     I have ever heard of.

383
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Hey, I don't see                
anybody else volunteering

384
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,700
to go over there                
and get roughed up

385
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,600
and hung by their heels.

386
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
I did it 'cause                 
I was trying to help.

387
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Okay, you were trying to help.

388
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Why'd you have to be      
      so stupid about it?

389
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,500
And that's another thing.

390
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm sick and tired              
of hearing that word.

391
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

392
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,200
If I hear that word             
one more time,

393
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm walking out of here         
and never coming back.

394
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
Oh, come on, man.   
            That's stupid.

395
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,500
That's it, I quit.

396
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,700
Cool down.

397
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,600
No, no, I'm serious.

398
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,000
I've had it with this place.

399
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
I'm not appreciated here    
            anymore.

400
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, Woody, come on, man.
        That's not true.

401
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
Leave me alone!

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,900
( <i>chuckling</i> )

403
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,500
Well, look who's back.

404
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,300
Sister Mary Woody.

405
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,800
( <i>laughing</i> )

406
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm looking for a job.

407
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
Oh, right.

408
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,400
I heard you quit Cheers.

409
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,800
I'm never going back      
    into Cheers again.

410
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Well, except to get       
     my last check and, uh,

411
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,000
the only key to my apartment.

412
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,900
So where'd you stay last night?

413
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,800
Well, I just walked around.

414
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,600
Down to the Commons,

415
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,100
over to the river,

416
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,200
across the river
                to Cambridge,

417
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,700
back over the river,

418
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
took a right at the 
            Prudential building,

419
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,700
stopped at a newsstand,

420
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
thought about buying a paper,  
        didn't...

421
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,600
Okay, okay, okay.

422
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
I get it.

423
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,900
So you're coming to me     
        for a job?

424
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
I don't owe Cheers diddly.

425
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,100
Well, you're                    
a darned good barkeep.

426
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
And I could use                 
an extra hand.

427
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,300
There's always         
     an upsurge of business

428
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,700
every year after I win     
    the Bloody Mary contest.

429
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,700
Why not?

430
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,600
Grab an apron                   
in the back.

431
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Oh, gee,

432
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,400
you won't regret this.

433
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,500
Wait till

434
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,200
I tell my mom I'm working       
     for that weasel Gary.

435
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,900
Are you crazy?                  
He's the enemy.

436
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,500
No, I think he's okay.

437
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,000
I was in Cheers
                 when he quit.

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
It was real ugly.

439
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,900
I don't know. Uh, you           
think we can trust him?

440
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,900
Gary?                           
            Well...

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
Yeah?

442
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,200
I found a nickel in             
the pocket of this apron.

443
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
You know who it belongs to      
or should I put up a flyer?

444
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,000

Afternoon, everybody.

Hey, hey, Gary.

Well, this is it!

448
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
The day of the big contest.

449
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,700
Hey, Woody, come here.

450
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,100
Yes, sir.

451
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,000
Woody, I'm gonna                
be honest with you.

452
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,700
I had my doubts about you       
having worked at Cheers and all,

453
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
but after the way you've worked 
out here this last week...

454
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,700
you're really one of us now.

455
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,200
Thank you.

By the way, here.

What is it?

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,300
It came for you a few days ago.

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
I forgot to give it to you.

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
"This is to inform you     
        that the contest

two hours to 12:00 noon."

You forgot to give this to me?

463
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Is it important?

464
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,700
Oh, wait a minute.          
         Wait a minute.

00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,500
Damn it, boy.

466
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,300
You and Malone set me up.

467

You knew about this             
time change two days ago.

Well, don't just stand there    
like a bump on a log.

Say something.

Got you, Gar.          
    ( <i>clicks tongue</i> )

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,900
That means the contest     
started five minutes ago.

Gee, boss,

473
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,600
I don't think          
     you're gonna make it.

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,800
I think you're gonna lose.

I think you're gonna fall       
    flat on your face.

I think...

I'm gonna be hanging      
    upside down again.

Get him!                        
Come on. Get him!

479
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,800
Well, I wish I could        
    give all of you an award,

480
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,300
but there can only
              be one winner...

Surprise, Malone.

I didn't get the message        
about the time change.

Yeah, right!                    
It didn't work.

That's a lie and you

And when you made such a fool of
yourself pretending to be a nun?

I mean, you usually pay off   
a judge after you <i>win</i> a contest.

560
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
If the contest that
             had just happened

were the real contest--
         which it wasn't--

562
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,500
and if this guy     
            were the real judge,

563
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
which he's not.

                door neighbor.
